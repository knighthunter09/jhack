  (RTTNews.com) - Following the lackluster performance seen last Friday, stocks have moved significantly lower in morning trading on Monday. The major averages have slid firmly into negative territory, adding to last week's steep losses. In recent trading, the major averages have fallen to new lows for the session. The Dow is down 257.18 points or 1 percent at 25,156.04, the Nasdaq is down 139.09 points or 1.9 percent at 7,108.78 and the S&P 500 is down 27.02 points or 1 percent at 2,709.25. Lingering concerns about the outlook for the global economy have generated selling pressure along with uncertainty about the potential for a trade deal between the U.S. and China. At the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit over the weekend, Vice President Mike Pence said the U.S. would not back down until China changes its ways. The stark warning dampened investor hopes for a thaw in U.S.-Chinese trade relations ahead of the G20 summit later this month in Argentina. A pullback by shares of Apple ( AAPL ) is also weighing on the markets, with the tech giant slumping by 3.2 percent after moving higher over the two previous sessions. The steep drop by Apple comes after the Wall Street Journal said the company slashed production orders for all three of the iPhone models that were unveiled in September. Negative sentiment was also generated by a report from the National Association of Home Builders showing a substantial decrease in homebuilder confidence in the month of November. The report said the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index plunged to 60 in November after inching up by one point to 68 in October. Economists had expected the index to edge down to 67. With the much bigger than expected decrease, the housing market index dropped to its lowest level since hitting 59 in August of 2016. "Builders report that they continue to see signs of consumer demand for new homes but that customers are taking a pause due to concerns over rising interest rates and home prices," said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz. Technology stocks have moved sharply lower in morning trading, contributing to the steep drop by the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Software, computer hardware, and semiconductor stocks are turning in some of the sector's worst performances. Considerable weakness has also emerged among retail stocks, as reflected by the 2 percent drop by the Dow Jones Retail Index. Biotechnology and steel stocks are also seeing notable weakness, while gold stocks are among the few groups bucking the downtrend. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher during trading on Monday. Japan'sNikkei 225 Index and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index both advanced by 0.7 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index jumped by 0.9 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets have turned mixed on the day. While the U.K.'sFTSE 100 Index is up by 0.1 percent, the German DAX Index and the French CAC 40 Index are down by 0.5 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively. In the bond market, treasuries are seeing modest strength amid the sell-off on Wall Street. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is down by 1.1 basis points at 3.063 percent. For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com

 By Medha Singh Nov 19 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set to open lower on Monday as shares of Apple and its suppliers were hit by ongoing concerns of slowing demand for iPhones, while conflicting signals of a potential truce in the China-U.S. trade dispute added to market jitters. Shares of Apple Inc  fell 1.8 percent in premarket trading after the Wall Street Journal reported the company has cut production orders in recent weeks for all three iPhone models launched in September.  Shares of Apple suppliers Skyworks Solutions Inc  and Lumentum Holdings Inc  were also down. Micron Technology Inc  fell 1.8 percent after a report that Chinese authorities have alleged "massive evidence" of antitrust violations by the world's top three memory chip makers, in the latest industrial spat that threatens to upset global trade relations.  At 8:43 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis  were down 58 points, or 0.23 percent. S&P 500 e-minis  were down 7.5 points, or 0.27 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis  were down 31 points, or 0.45 percent. Over the weekend, Asia-Pacific leaders failed to agree on a communique for the first time ever at a meeting in Papua New Guinea with U.S.-China trade worries on the forefront.  U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Saturday the United States will not back down from its trade dispute with China, and might even double its tariffs, unless Beijing bows to U.S. demands, dampening Friday's trade optimism that was fueled by U.S. President Donald Trump's comments.  "Markets are a little bit cautious with regard to the comments that Pence made over the weekend and the fact that they couldn't get a communique out of APEC meeting," said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. China'sJD.com Inc  slipped 3 percent after reporting third-quarter revenue below analysts' estimates on sluggish sales in its core e-commerce business.  Shares of Cimarex Energy Co  fell 6.2 percent after the oil and gas producer agreed to acquire smaller rival Resolute Energy Corp  for $1.6 billion, including debt.

 Wal-Mart WMT  reported blockbuster third-quarter fiscal 2019 results. The mega retailer topped estimates on the top and the bottom lines driven by strength in the e-commerce business. It raised its fiscal year guidance, inspiring optimism about the company's growth prospects.      This is especially true as the company has been on an acquisition spree. It is buying brands aimed at millennial shoppers to compete with Amazon in categories like apparel and home goods, while also scaling up its grocery business.

Based on strong momentum, the brick-and-mortar retailer raised its fiscal-year guidance. Earnings per share are now expected in the range of $4.75-$4.85 compared with $4.65-$4.80 previously.  U.S. same-store sales are estimated to increase at least 3%, up from the previous expectation of about 3%.

US STOCKS-S&P 500 falls for fifth day as financials drag
Stocks Fluctuate Wildly Before Closing Firmly Negative - U.S. Commentary
US STOCKS-S&P 500 down for fifth day as financials fall
 Wall Street ended mostly lower on Tuesday as crude  oil prices  continued their downward journey. U.S. stocks were regaining grounds from previous day's mayhem in the initial hours of trading following some positive news on trade war front. However, the enthusiasm was short-lived as no concrete news appeared from trade front along with further sliding of  crude oil prices  . The Dow and S&P 500 closed in the red while Nasdaq Composite remained flat.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 25,286.49, shedding 0.4% or 100.69 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) declined 0.2% to close at 2,722.18. However, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,200.88, adding just 1 point. A total of 8.2 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 8.4 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1.08-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners had an edge over advancers by 1.05-to-1 ratio.  The CBOE VIX increased 3.9% to close at 21.24.   How Did the Benchmarks Perform? The Dow ended in negative territory for the third straight day. Notably, 18 components of the 30-stock blue-chip index closed in the red while 11 finished in the green and the remaining one was unchanged. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite closed as essentially flat compared with the previous day's closing, reversing its three days losing streak due to good performance of chip makers.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 also closed in the red for fourth consecutive days after registering its lowest closing since Oct 31. Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) is the major loser dropping 2.3%. Notably, six out of total 11 sectors of the benchmark index closed in the red while five finished in the green. Free Fall of Crude Oil Prices On Nov 13, the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil future price for December delivery fell $4.24 or 7.1% to settle at $55.69 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Thiswas the lowest front-month contract finish since Nov 16, 2017 and biggest one-day percentage decline since September 2015. Moreover, this was the twelfth straight loss for WTI crude prices, the longest slide since March 1983.Notably, on Nov 8, WTI Crude oil entered into bear market as price tumbled more than 20% from its recent peak recorded at Oct 3. On Nov 13, the global benchmark of Brent Crude oil prices fell$4.65 or 6.6% to settle at $65.47 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. With this, the Brent crude oil has also entered bear market after tumbling nearly 24% from its recent peak in October.Recent nosedive of crude prices has raised eyebrows about an impending global economic slowdown. According to industry researchers, surge in global oil supply and significantly weak global demand for oil is the reason for oil price plunge.Precipitous decline of crude oil prices further intensified following a tweet by President Trump on Tuesday stating that he is hopeful that "Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!". U.S. - China Trade Talk Remains Inconclusive On Nov 13 morning, The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He talked to each other on Nov 9 in order to prepare ground for a meeting between President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping later this month in G-20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Later, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow confirmed the report.However, neither of the two countries has given any sort of positive news regarding an amicable solution to the eight-month old tariff related conflicts. The Trump administration has raised serious questions about the trade practices of China related to intellectual property rights of high-tech patents.An inconclusive trade negotiation between the United States and China has negative effect on trade-sensitive stocks. Shares of Apple Inc. AAPL  declined 1.9% after sliding 5% yesterday. Notably, various component suppliers have hinted for lower sales to the company raising eyebrows of several market participants regarding future prospects of iPhone and iPADs.

Futures flat ahead of inflation data
 By Sruthi Shankar Nov 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were little changed on Wednesday, with weak economic data from Japan and Germany adding to global growth worries ahead of U.S. consumer price numbers that could offer clues on future interest rate hikes. The muted moves in futures follow losses for Asia and Europe after data showed soft retail sales in China and slowing Japanese and German economies in the third quarter.  Volatile oil prices have hit energy companies, with the S&P energy index  falling 9.4 percent this year, and were among the worst S&P performers in 2018. A mix of factors from a bitter trade dispute between the United States and China, worries about rising interest rates and slowing corporate profit have stalled gains for U.S. stocks, with the S&P 500 trading 7 percent below its record level. Trade tensions took a step back on Tuesday after a U.S. adviser Larry Kudlow said Washington welcomed the resumption of talks with China on trade.  The U.S. Labor Department is set to release October consumer prices numbers at 8:30 a.m. ET. The report is likely to show a 0.3 percent rise after an increase of 0.1 percent in September. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, consumer prices are forecast to have risen 0.2 percent, after edging up 0.1 percent the month before. A surprise to the upside could add to the case for further interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, with a December move almost fully priced in. At 7:26 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis  were up 24 points, or 0.09 percent. S&P 500 e-minis  were up 2.25 points, or 0.08 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis  were down 10 points, or 0.15 percent. Among stocks, Apple Inc  slipped 0.2 percent after UBS cut the iPhone maker's earnings estimate following profit warnings from several of its suppliers. Snap Inc  fell 4.3 percent after Reuters reported that U.S. regulators have subpoenaed the social media app maker for information about its March 2017 initial public offering.  Department store operator Macy's Inc  fell 0.2 percent ahead of its earnings.

Nikkei edges lower in choppy trade; resource shares underperform
Apple Shares Down 5%, Now What?
The Dow traded in a range of more than 300 points on both sides of breakeven, before ultimately ending lower.  Apple (   AAPL    )   continued to weigh on the index, as did a disappointing post-earnings performance from  Home Depot (   HD    )   . Boeing ( BA  ) stock was among the biggest Dow drags, amid reports the firm failed to disclose potential 737 Max flight issues, and oil majors Chevron ( CVX  ) and Exxon Mobil ( XOM  ) fell with crude.Specifically, oil continued its record-breaking slide, ending lower for a 12th straight session. The commodity suffered its worst daily loss in years, and dropped to its lowest level since November 2017. Against this backdrop -- and despite optimism about trade talks with China -- the Dow and S&P finished a volatile session in the red. The Nasdaq, on the other hand, eked out a gain, as several tech stocks staged a rebound. Continue reading for more on today's market, including: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI - 25,286.49)   sunk 100.7 points today, or 0.4%.

Exxon Mobil ( XOM  ) was at the bottom of the list, dropping 2.3%. The S&P 500 Index (SPX - 2,722.18)   fell 4 points, or 0.2%, while the  Nasdaq Composite (IXIC - 7,200.88)  edged up a mere 0.01 point, after spending most of the session higher. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX - 20.02)  also fell 0.4 point, or 2.1%.            Data courtesy of              Trade-Alert    Oil prices tanked yet again, settling at nearly one-year lows and continuing their record-breaking losing streak for a 12th straight session.Even as President Donald Trump pressed both the Organization of the Petroleum Countries (OPEC) and Saudi Arabia to uphold current production policies, the former cut its demand forecast for oil in 2019. Oil for December delivery dropped another $4.24, or 7.1%, to settle at $55.69 per barrel. It was black gold's steepest one-day drop in roughly three years, per Dow Jones.Gold prices inched lower today, even as the U.S. dollar index plateaued after hitting its highest rate since July 2017. December-dated gold futures fell $2.10, or 0.2%, to settle at $1,201.40 an ounce --- gold's fourth straight drop. 
Wall Street's benchmark averages were on the mend after Monday's frenzied sell-off as hopes for renewed trade negotiations between top US and Chinese officials halted a three-day losing streak for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Led by gains in Caterpillar ( CAT  ) and Intel ( INTC  ), the Dow Jones Industrial Average is modestly higher and holding steady above its 200-day moving average.The hard-hit tech sector was taking the lead Tuesday with Vodafone ( VOD  ) out ahead after its new CEO announced plans to cuts costs, and Apple ( AAPL  ) shares were higher after falling nearly 8% in just the past three days.Amazon ( AMZN  ) was also giving a lift to the Nasdaq after the company said it will open a second headquarters in both Crystal City, VA and Long Island City, NY. The announcement ends a year-long, 200-city search, and unlocks nearly $2.1 billion in tax incentives.Shares of Boeing (BA) and Home Depot (HD) are weighing on the blue chip index with both trading at their lowest levels in as much as two weeks.

The retailer surrendered early gains after an underwhelming earnings call.The energy complex is one of the day's worst performing sectors as oil futures continue to drop in the wake of President Trump's criticism of proposed Saudi Arabian production cuts, and increased US production. Brent crude was down a substantial 4% while West Texas intermediate was lower for an unprecedented twelfth day in a row.European shares were higher in tandem with their US counterparts despite sizable gains in the euro and British pound, the latter up more than 1% against the dollar amid a breakthrough on Brexit negotiations. Gains for the UK's FTSE-100 were constrained, however, by soft UK labor market data in which the jobless rate inched up to 4.1% on a much greater-than-expected increase in new jobless claimants.Crude oil was down $2.45 to $57.48 per barrel.

Apple Stock Got Hammered, But Its Suppliers Are Suffering a Worse Fate
 U.S. stock markets plunged on Monday as record drop in shares of Apple and Goldman Sachs, and precipitous decline of crude  oil prices  ignificantly dented investor confidence. Moreover, Rising U.S. dollar index and lingering trade conflicts with China also weighed on investor sentiment. All three major stock indexes extended their losses after last Friday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 25,387.18, shedding 2.3% or 602.12 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) declined 2% to close at 2,726.22. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,200.87, dropping 2.8% or 206.03 points.

On the Nasdaq, decliners had an edge over advancers by 3.64-to-1 ratio.  The CBOE VIX increased 13.4% to close at 19.64.   How Did the Benchmarks Perform? The Dow ended in negative territory for the second straight day. Notably, 26 components of the 30-stock blue-chip index closed in the red while the remaining 4 finished in the green. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite closed in negative territory for third successive days, due to weak performance of chip makers.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 also closed in the red for third consecutive days. Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) are major losers dropping 3.5% and 2.1%, respectively. Notably, ten out of total 11 sectors of the benchmark index closed in the red while one finished in the green. U.S. Crude Oil Price Records Longest Decline On Nov 12, U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil future price for December delivery settled at $58.86 a barrel. This was the eleventh straight loss for WTI crude prices, the longest slide since March 1983. Moreover, for the first time since February, WTI crude oil price settled below the key psychological barrier of $60.Recent nosedive of crude prices has raised eyebrows about an impending global economic slowdown. On Nov 8, WTI Crude oil entered into bear market as price tumbled more than 20% from its recent peak recorded at Oct 3. Apple and Goldman Sachs Posts Record Decline On Nov 12, shares of Apple Inc. AAPL  declined 5% following the news that Lumentum Holdings Inc. LITE  , a major component supplier of iPhones, lowered its guidance for fiscal second-quarter of 2019 due to a reduction in shipment to a major customer. Shares of Lumentum Holdings plummeted 33%.Shares of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

US Dollar Index Hits 16-Month High On Nov 13, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the greenback's strength against a basket of six major currencies, touched 97.28, its highest level since Jun 23, 2017. Demand for the dollar intensified after the Fed hinted a possible rate hike in December and again in early 2019 last week.Moreover, quandary regarding the acceptance of the Brexit deal by the UK parliament and a tussle between Italy and the European Union concerning fiscal discipline resulted in the decline of of Pound and Euro against the U.S. dollar. However, investors are concerned that a rising dollar will hurt sales of U.S. multinational companies as their products will be more expensive in international markets. Battle of Tariffs Intensify As per Axios report, President Donald Trump is mulling over levying heavy tariffs on overseas automakers. The report stated that Trump considered that a threat of hefty auto tariff was his weapon against Canada for bilateral deal. Now, he wants to sue this weapon against European Union.

Apple Loses $1 Trillion Club Membership
Qorvo joins other Apple suppliers in cutting forecast
 TAIPEI, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Taiwan'sFoxconn  posted a weaker than expected rise in quarterly profit amid warning signs from key customer Apple Inc  and its global suppliers that demand for iPhones could be softening. Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, reported net profit of T$24.88 billion ($805.52 million)for the third quarter on Tuesday, 12 percent short of analyst expectations. While this was the biggest quarterly profit the company has posted this year and came in 18 percent above the year-earlier results, it was below a mean estimate of T$28.26 billion  ($916.85 million) from nine analysts, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. "In addition, costs controls were good, the ratio of operating expenses was smaller, which led to a profit increase performance," the official added. Apple warned earlier this month that holiday sales would miss Wall Street expectations due to weakness in emerging markets including India and foreign-exchange costs.  Shares in Foxconn and other Asian suppliers and assemblers for Apple fell on Tuesday after several component makers warned of weaker than expected results, leading some market watchers to call the peak for iPhones in several key markets.  Last week, Hon Hai reported that its October sales were up 21.5 percent year on year, the slowest year-on-year growth rate for any month since April.  Analysts said Apple changing the bottom cover of the iPhone 8 and iPhone X from metal to glass hurt profits at Foxconn, which had supplied the metal component. Foxconn's gross margin this year is unlikely to return to the 7 percent it enjoyed in the 2015-2016 fiscal years due to weakening iPhone shipment growth and lower prices for metal casings, Fubon Research analyst Arthur Liao said in a research note ahead of the company's earnings. Foxconn is a key assembler of the iPhone XR model, according to analysts, the cheapest of this year's new launches and a model that is likely seeing very little traction with customers. Japan's Nikkei daily reported earlier this month that Apple had told Foxconn and rival Pegatron Corp  to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to the iPhone XR.

Dow Sinks 600 Points as Apple, Goldman Stocks Plummet
  (RTTNews.com) - The Indonesia stock market has moved lower in consecutive trading days, surrendering nearly 200 points or 3.3 percent along the way. The Jakarta Composite Index now rests just above the 5,775-point plateau and it's expected to open under pressure again on Tuesday. The global forecast for the Asian markets is soft, with weakness expected among the technology stocks and oil companies. The European and U.S. markets were down and the Asian bourse are expected to follow suit. The JCI finished sharply lower on Monday following heavy damage among the cement stocks, financial shares and resource plays. For the day, the index tumbled 97.10 points or 1.65 percent to finish at the daily low of 5,777.05 after peaking at 5,884.08. Among the actives, Indocement plunged 5.95 percent, while Semen Indonesia plummeted 5.91 percent, United Tractors cratered 5.23 percent, Unilever retreated 2.36 percent, Indofood tumbled 3.46 percent, XL Axiata skidded 3.52 percent, Bukit Darmo Property jumped 1.67 percent, SLJ Global climbed 1.03 percent, Lotte Chemical added 0.61 percent, Jasa Marga dropped 1.50 percent, Bank Pan Indonesia collected 1.38 percent, Voksel Electric shed 0.52 percent, Bank Central Asia lost 1.25 percent, Bank Mandiri declined 3.46 percent, Bank Negara plummeted 5.00 percent, Bank Rakyat Indonesia slid 1.80 percent, Indosat tumbled 4.44 percent, Bumi Resources fell 1.10 percent, Aneka Tambang was down 2.14 percent, Vale Indonesia dropped 1.52 percent and Bank MNC Internasional and Bank Danamon Indonesia were unchanged. The lead from Wall Street is broadly negative as stocks moved sharply lower on Monday, extending losses from the previous session. The Dow plunged 602.12 points or 2.32 percent to 25,387.18, while the NASDAQ dropped 206.03 points or 2.78 percent to 7,200.87 and the S&P fell 54.79 points or 1.97 percent to 2,726.22. A sharp decline by shares of Apple (AAPL) and General Electric (GE) weighed on the markets, while concerns about the outlook for global economic growth and a continued increase in interest rates also contributed to the sell-off. Light trading activity may have exaggerated the downward move, however, as government offices, the bond markets, and most banks were closed in observance of Veterans Day. Crude oil shook off early gains on Monday to end lower for the 11th straight session on oversupply concerns. Crude oil futures for December, which rose to $61.28 earlier in the session, settled lower by $0.26 or 0.4 percent at $59.93 a barrel, the lowest settlement since February.

 By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Asian shares skidded on Tuesday, pressured by a tech rout on Wall Street and a slump in oil prices, while political risks in Europe buoyed the dollar as investors dumped riskier assets. Fears of a likely peak in corporate earnings growth, softening global demand and faster rate hikes in the United States have put global investors on edge over the past month, prompting them to take money off the table before year end. Japan's Nikkei  dived 3.2 percent, led by losses in electric machinery makers and suppliers of Apple's  iPhone parts after three suppliers issued warnings on results, sending tech-heavy Nasdaq  slumping over 2 percent. The grim outlook triggered a steep selloff in Asian tech firms, with shares in Japan Display  plummeting over 11 percent while Murata Manufacturing  and TDK Corp  dived as much as 8.9 percent and 8.4 percent respectively. Taiwanese suppliers of the iPhone such as Genius, Pegatron  and Hon Hai  were also deep in red. "Market participants are gradually thinking that this technology stocks boom is going to end before long," said Yoshinori Shigemi, Japan-based global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. "Lower oil prices are another headwind for U.S. stock markets, specially the energy sector." "We are suggesting our clients to shift from any technology stocks to quality names, stocks with high return-on-equity and low leverage," Shigemi said without naming any stocks. South Korea's KOSPI index  dropped 1.7 percent with Samsung Electronics  down 2.8 percent. Chinese shares were also in the red, with the blue-chip CSI 300 index  off 0.6 percent. The Asia ex-Japan index is now down nearly 17 percent this year, after a solid 33.5 percent gain in 2017, with October the worst month since mid-2015. "The U.S tech sector... is generally expensive, over-owned and earnings momentum is not able to keep up with lofty expectations," said Jordan Cvetanovski, portfolio manager at Pengana International Equities. "In the case of Apple, we are now seeing evidence of a consumer that is saturated with their products and Apple's inability to innovate sufficiently to attract new users is showing in the latest projections for...the iPhone," he added. 
 E*TRADE WAR Investor sentiment has also been dented by the deepening trade battle between the United States and China, with Asian emerging markets suffering their largest monthly foreign outflows last month since August 2011, according to Khoon Goh, Singapore-based head of Asia research for ANZ Banking Group. Funds returned over the early part of November on hopes that U.S.-China tensions would ease, Goh added, with the focus  on a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping later this month. "The outcome of the meeting will have an important influence on portfolio flows in Asia into the end of the year," Goh added. Worryingly, the Trump administration is broadening its China trade battle beyond tariffs with a plan to use export controls, indictments and other tools to counter the theft of intellectual property, the Wall Street Journal reported citing sources. Risk assets including Asian equities have also been hurt by rising U.S. interest rates. The Federal Reserve is expected to tighten policy further in December. The Fed's San Francisco President Mary Daly said on Monday the U.S. central bank should continue to raise rates gradually with her "modal" forecast showing two to three rate hikes over the next period of time.  In Europe, fears that Britain could crash out of the European Union without a Brexit deal and a growing rift over Italy's budget hit the euro and the pound, pushing the dollar's index  to 97.693 against a basket of currencies, a level not seen since mid 2017. It was last at 97.581. The euro  was slightly firmer at $1.1233 after breaking below important chart support of $1.13. The Italian government is facing a Tuesday deadline for it to submit a revised budget to the EU. Sterling  fell to $1.2825 as three straight sessions of losses took it to the lowest since Nov.1. There were still considerable unresolved issues with the EU over Brexit, British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Monday.  It was last up 0.1 percent at $1.286. Oil prices hovered near multi-month lows after declining for a record 11th consecutive session amid softening demand and as Trump said he hoped there would be no oil output reductions.  U.S. crude  skidded 74 cents to $59.19 a barrel. Brent crude futures  fell 61 cents to $69.51. Spot gold  was 0.2 percent firmer at $1,202.9 per ounce.

Stocks continued to lose ground on Monday with the tech sector leading decliners as worries mount surrounding Apple's ( AAPL  ) suppliers, and Washington's efforts to thwart Chinese IP piracy raise trade-war tensions on Wall Street. Led by heavy losses in component stocks Apple and Goldman Sachs ( GS  ), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 450 points at midday to its lowest level in almost five days.Overnight losses accelerated at the NYSE open on the heels of reports that the White House was expanding its trade war against China to include IP theft. Already on the defensive after Friday's sell-off and worrisome headlines from Europe tied to Brexit and Italy, the Dow opened more than 100 points lower and wiped out most of last week's gains by mid-morning.The tech sector was jerked lower after Lumentum ( LITE  ) slashed fiscal Q2 sales and EPS guidance after Apple requested a "material" reduction in shipments of 3D chips. The tech-laden Nasdaq spilled to its lowest level in nine days with chipmakers and hardware stocks taking the brunt of Monday's losses.As investors seek a refuge from risk, US Treasury yields are as much as 5 basis points lower with the belly of the yield curve outperforming. Defensive sectors are also higher led by gains in utilities. Energy shares are lower, however, even with West Texas intermediate trading in the green for the first time in 11 days.European bourses limped into the close in sympathy with US losses as Brexit worries and new concerns about the Italian banking sector continued to take a toll despite corresponding weakness for the euro and British pound. The lack of progress on either the UK's divorce from the European Union or Italy's budget drove the pound and euro sharply lower against the US dollar.Crude oil was up $0.73 to $60.92 per barrel. Natural gas was up $0.07 to $3.79 per 1 million BTU. Gold was down $4.50 to $1,204.20 an ounce, while silver was down $0.12 to $14.02 an ounce.

 By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK, Nov 12 (Reuters) - U.S. and European stocks fell sharply on Monday, with tech stocks in both regions getting hammered, while the U.S. dollar surged to its highest point in 16 months against a basket of currencies amid concern about European political risks. Major U.S. stock indexes dropped about 2 percent or more. Indexes were weighed down by a 5.0 percent slump in index heavyweight Apple, after an iPhone parts supplier cut its outlook.  "The concerns are all about global economic growth, specifically demands for the products of companies like Apple," said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. "Investors are becoming more concerned about faster-growing companies and whether they will continue to grow at that pace." The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 602.12 points, or 2.32 percent, to 25,387.18, the S&P 500  lost 54.79 points, or 1.97 percent, to 2,726.22 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 206.03 points, or 2.78 percent, to 7,200.87.  Apple shares fell as the main supplier for its Face-ID technology, Lumentum Holdings Inc, slashed revenue and profit forecasts, citing reduced orders from a major customer. Lumentum shares tumbled 33.0 percent and shares of other Apple suppliers also dropped.  The S&P 500 technology sector, a main driver of the long U.S. bull run in stocks, sank 3.5 percent. Goldman Sachs  shares fell 7.5 percent, weighing on the financials sector  and the Dow industrials, after a report that Malaysia would seek full refund of fees paid to the bank related to state fund 1MDB.  "It's an ugly sell-off across the board, led by Apple and Goldman," said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.

U.S. crude  fell 26 cents a barrel to settle at $59.93. Brent crude futures  reversed course late in the session, settling down 6 cents at $70.12 a barrel.

Apple Remains Firmly Negative In Late-Day Trading
Economic weakness in emerging-market countries will hurt Apple  (AAPL) iPhone shipments, according to JPMorgan.The firm's analyst Samik Chatterjee adjusted his price target to $266 from $270 for  Apple stock, citing the risk of economic growth slowdowns in several countries due to currency moves."We are trimming our earnings estimates as we now forecast modest year-over-year declines in iPhone shipments for both calendar 2018 and 2019 on account of a weaker macro backdrop in emerging markets," he wrote on Monday. "The headwind of the stronger [dollar is] making phones more expensive in local currencies."Apple stock is down 3.7% to $196.82 on Monday. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.Chatterjee said emerging-market countries - including China, Russia, Turkey and India - represent 46% of Apple's iPhone unit volume. He noted the average emerging-market currency has depreciated about 15% year-over-year against the U.S. dollar."The average depreciation over a year ago implies a similar average price increase in local currencies for iPhones in addition to the ASP increases as part of Apple's strategy to move consumers to higher-end phones, driving affordability challenges in EMs," he wrote.As a result, Chatterjee cut his 2018 iPhone unit sales estimate by 2 million to 214 million and reduced his forecast for 2019 by 10 million to 208 million.He reiterated his Overweight rating for Apple stock due to its long-term opportunity in services.      https://asset.barrons.com/dj-mg/dice/barrons-staffpicks-2d590600-c862-4394-b9d3-66b48c376d60/inset.json Other analysts are becoming more concerned about falling iPhone demand, too.Longbow Research said on Monday the firm's checks  show Apple is cutting production orders for its latest models.On Thursday KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh said iPhone XR inventory is piling up  at stores due to weak sales.And last week, The Nikkei Asian Review reported the tech giant  is telling its suppliers to cancel plans for additional iPhone XR production lines.
  (RTTNews.com) - After gapping open lower, shares of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (SWKS) have seen some further downside during trading on Monday. Skyworks is currently down by 4.4 percent after hitting its lowest intraday level in nearly two years. The steep drop by Skyworks comes after Citi downgraded its rating on the Apple ( AAPL ) chip supplier's stock to Neutral from Buy. Cit analyst Atif Malik attributed the downgrade to broad smartphone weakness observation in China and disappointing iPhone XR unit sales. "Additionally, we now think that 5G is a 2020 story versus our prior 2019 view with little upside in 2019 from 5G implementation," Malik said.

Is Roku Stock Still A Buy Despite 'Disappointing' Q3?
Weighed down by accelerating inflation and its likely impact on Federal Reserve monetary policy, slowing Chinese economic growth and lackluster corporate guidance, stocks were losing ground on Friday with the Nasdaq Composite again taking the full force of Wall Street's aversion to risk.Losses accelerated midday after comments from US trade representative Peter Navarro suggested that a trade deal with China would be more problematic. Led by losses in component stocks Caterpillar ( CAT  ) and Apple ( AAPL  ), the Dow Jones Industrial Average is more than 220 points below the prior day's close.The energy complex was an additional anchor on the market indices with Iranian waivers and robust US production dragging Brent crude futures to their lowest level since April and West Texas intermediate down for a 10th consecutive day.Despite Friday's negative price action, the benchmark averages are all indicated to close higher for a second consecutive week.With Thursday's Federal Open Market Committee meeting statement already casting a shadow over Wall Street, the defensive tone was amplified by a surge in wholesale prices that give the Fed more ammunition to keep raising interest rates well into 2019. The nominal producer price index increased 0.6% in October -- its strongest increase in six years -- and increased to 2.9% on an annual basis, exceeding estimates of +0.2% and 2.5%, respectively.Excluding the volatile food and fuel segment, the core producer price index was up 0.5% monthly and at 2.6% on an annual basis, versus +0.2% and 2.3% estimates, respectively.Data released later in the morning was slightly better. The preliminary University of Michigan consumer sentiment index declined slightly to 98.3 in November from 98.6 but was better than the 98.0 estimate.And wholesale inventories increased a slightly better-than-expected 0.4% in September, while sales were up 0.2%.On the heels of soft Chinese auto sales and inflation data and amplified by weakness in Spanish banks and European oil drillers and refiners, most bourses were lower across the continent, ending a tumultuous week in the red.Crude oil was down $0.69 to $59.98 per barrel. Natural gas was up $0.23 to $3.77 per 1 million BTU. Gold was down $16.10 to $1,209.10 an ounce, while silver was down $0.30 to $14.11 an ounce. Copper was down $0.05 to $2.68 per pound.Among energy ETFs, the United States Oil Fund was down 0.86% to $12.73 with the United States Natural Gas Fund up 5.29% to $30.47. Among precious-metal funds, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF was down 2.03% to $18.88 while SPDR Gold Shares were down 1.26% to $114.32.

 By Sijia Jiang HONG KONG, Nov 8 (Reuters) - AAC Technologies Holdings Inc, an acoustic components supplier to Apple Inc, on Thursday reported a drop of 28.7 percent to 973 million yuan ($140.38 million) in quarterly net profit, dented by lacklustre iPhone sales volume growth. AAC Technologies, which supplies acoustic and haptic components for Apple products such as the iPhone, said revenue in the July-September quarter dropped 8.5 percent to 4.87 billion yuan, compared with consensus estimate of 5.7 billion yuan. Apple's iPhone shipment unit in the September quarter remained almost flat from previous year at 46.9 million units, even though total revenue jumped 20 percent due to higher product prices.  An appreciation of the Chinese yuan and a weak product upgrade cycle resulted in a 4.2 percentage points decrease in gross profit margin for the first nine months of the year, AAC said.

Breaking Down Apple's Fiscal Fourth Quarter
 SAN FRANCISCONov 7 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co  said on Wednesday it planned to invest $22 billion in artificial intelligence technology by 2020. Speaking at its developers conference in San Francisco, Samsung's head of AI, Eui Suk Chung, also said the company will hire a thousand employees to work on the technology in the same period. Samsung is expected to launch its much-anticipated foldable phone to developers at the conference later on Wednesday. 
  (RTTNews.com) - A U.S. district judge ruled on Tuesday that chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) must license some of its industry-essential patents to rival chipmakers. The ruling marks a major setback for Qualcomm in its legal battle with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or FTC. Qualcomm has refused to offer licenses to rival chipmakers, such as Intel Corp. (INTC) and MediaTek Inc. The ruling is also seen as posing a threat to Qualcomm's patent licensing business model, which collects patent royalties based on the wholesale prices of smartphones, rather than the individual components inside them. The FTC brought an antitrust lawsuit against Qualcomm in early 2017. The lawsuit is set to go to trial in 2019. In a preliminary ruling on Tuesday, Judge Lucy Koh in the the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that Qualcomm must license its essential patents to competing modem chip suppliers. In the complaint, the FTC has alleged that Qualcomm is a "dominant supplier" of modem chips and the holder of standard essential patents or SEPs essential to "widely adopted cellular standards." According to the FTC, Qualcomm has harmed competition and violated the FTCA via interrelated policies and practices. The FTC alleges that because of those practices, customers for Qualcomm's modem chips must pay elevated royalties, while Qualcomm's refusal to license its SEPs to competing modem chip suppliers ensures that Qualcomm's customers must depend on the company for their modem chip supply. The judge agreed with the FTC that Qualcomm's two industry agreements with standard setting organizations or SSOs - Telecommunications Industry Association or TIA and the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions or ATIS - require the company to license its SEPs to other modem chip suppliers.  "â€¦the Court agrees with the FTC that as a matter of law, the TIA and ATIS IPR policies both require Qualcomm to license its SEPs to modem chip suppliers. Because after considering the language of the contract and any admissible extrinsic evidence, the meaning of the contract is unambiguous," the judge said in her ruling. The judge also noted that in a past infringement lawsuit with Ericsson (ERIC), Qualcomm had argued that the network equipment maker could not discriminate against the company by refusing to grant it a license.

Stocks, dollar hunker down for U.S. midterm elections
 By Marc Jones LONDON, Nov 6 (Reuters) - European shares ticked lower and the dollar and bond markets barely budged on Tuesday, as traders braced for midterm elections in the United States and some potentially lively sessions ahead. Japan  and Hong Kong had helped Asia overcome another Chinese wobble, but Europe  slipped into the red early on as investors pounced on some corporate earnings misses and pre-U.S. midterms caution took hold. The dollar dipped against the euro  and sterling, but made up ground on the Japanese yen  as dealers kept their options open after the U.S. currency's bumper year so far. "It is definitely not the time to buy the dip," said London & Capital's Chief Investment Officer Pau Morilla-Giner, referring to U.S. and globally-focused stock markets and risk assets. "Everything that could go well for U.S. consumers in the last couple of years has gone well, but now the tide is turning... At the moment you are running out of drivers of growth in the U.S." Italian  and Spanish  stocks weakened as updated PMI figures confirmed euro zone business growth had fallen to a two-year low last month against the backdrop of trade tensions.  The future output index caused even more concern as it fell to a near four-year low of 60.5 from 62.1.  "Euro zone companies reported a disappointing start to the fourth quarter," said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit which compiles the data. Italian government bond yields were also pushing up after euro zone finance ministers called on Rome to change its budget at a meeting on Monday.  That had done little to ease the standoff between Italy and the European Union over the spending plan. With Rome not likely to bow to the demands any time soon it reignited concerns about a further escalation in the feud. 
 OIL SPILL In Asian trading, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares ex-Japan  edged up 0.4 percent following a positive finish for Wall Street on Monday. Japan's Nikkei  also climbed 1.1 percent though weaker Chinese markets and regional technology shares capped the region. Apple  suppliers such as Taiwan'sHon Hai Precision Industry  were hit by a report that Apple had told its smartphone assemblers to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to the iPhone XR. The report had also driven Apple shares 2.8 percent lower in U.S. trade. While political gridlock between the White House and Congress could hinder Trump's pro-business agenda and raise concerns about U.S. political instability, some analysts say this may have already been priced in by investors. The Cboe Skew index, also known as the "black swan" index, hovered not far from its 2-1/2-year low hit Friday, indicating demand for options that provide protection remains tepid. A higher skew typically indicates investors are buying more protection on heightened anxiety. "Unlike the U.S. Presidential election or the U.K.'s Brexit referendum, the upcoming U.S. (midterm) elections are not a binary event," said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments. "So it's unlikely to send stocks significantly in one direction, apart from initial quick reactions." Gold was little changed but in oil markets crude prices were near multi-month lows after the United States allowed eight countries to continue buying oil from Iran temporarily, easing the likelihood of a sharp supply drop.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures  slipped 0.3 percent to $62.89 a barrel, after hitting a seven-month low of $62.52 on Monday. Brent crude futures  dropped 0.6 percent to $72.74 a barrel, near Friday's 2-1/2-month low of $72.16. Both oil benchmarks have slid more than 15 percent since hitting four-year highs in early October.

Thai Stock Market Expected To Be Rangebound
  (RTTNews.com) - The Thai stock market has finished lower in two of three trading days since the end of the three-day winning streak in which it had gathered almost 40 points or 2.5 percent. The Stock Exchange of Thailand now rests just above the 1,670-point plateau and little movement is expected for the bourse on Tuesday. The global forecast for the Asian markets is murky ahead of U.S. midterm elections later today as weakness from oil and technology stocks will likely cap any upside. The European and U.S. markets were mixed and little changed and the Asian bourses figure to open in similar fashion. The SET finished modestly lower on Monday following losses from the financial shares and the energy producers. For the day, the index slid 11.26 points or 0.67 percent to finish at 1,670.58 after trading between 1,666.50 and 1,673.01. Volume was 9.698 billion shares worth 38.069 billion baht. There were 1,020 decliners and 388 gainers, with 398 stocks finishing unchanged.

Siam Concrete lost 0.94 percent and Charoen Pokphand Foods, Banpu and Bangkok Bank were unchanged. The lead from Wall Street provides little clarity as stocks moved in opposite directions on Monday, with the Dow and the S&P 500 adding to last week's strong gains but the tech-heavy NASDAQ extending the sharp pullback seen last Friday. The Dow added 190.87 points or 0.76 percent to 25,461.70, while the NASDAQ fell 28.14 points or 0.38 percent to 7,328.85 and the S&P 500 gained 15.25 points or 0.56 percent to 2,738.31. A notable drop by Apple ( AAPL ) weighed on the NASDAQ after a report from Japan'sNikkei newspaper said demand for the company's iPhone XR appears to be disappointing. Overall trading was subdued, with traders reluctant to make significant moves ahead of today's midterm elections, which will decide control of both the House and Senate. Democrats are seen as having a better chance to claim a majority in the House, which would allow them to hinder President Donald Trump's agenda. The Federal Reserve's looming monetary policy announcement on Thursday also kept traders on the sidelines. While the Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged, traders will keep a close eye on the accompanying statement for clues about an expected rate hike in December. Crude oil futures eased Monday, after having moved up earlier in the day as U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil and came into force. Crude oil futures for December ended down $0.04 or less than 0.1 percent at $63.10 a barrel. For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com

Stocks surrendered premarket gains and were trading with heavy losses after hopes for a US/China trade deal were dashed, wiping out a 300+ point gain in Dow futures. Weighed down by outsized losses in components Apple ( AAPL  ) and Kraft Heinz ( KHC  ), the Nasdaq Composite is in the red for the first time in four days.But in spite of Friday's poor price action, all of the major indices -- including the Russell 2000 -- are still indicated to close the week higher.The risk rally went into overdrive last night after Bloomberg reported President Donald Trump tasked his cabinet with putting together a trade deal with China. China's Shanghai sprinted higher, fueling substantial gains in European and US equity markets. The mood soured, however, when the White House denied reports of a deal and indicated there is a "long way to go" on negotiations, shifting Wall Street's focus back on Apple's disappointing iPhone and iPad sales.The reversal also followed bullish data on the labor market as October nonfarm payrolls were up a better-than-expected 250,000 and average hourly earnings rose by more than 3% year-over-year for the first time in more than nine years.Additionally, factory orders jumped 0.7% in October and followed an upwardly revised 2.6% gain the month prior.Friday morning's remaining economic reports were not as bullish, however, as the trade deficit swelled to $54.0 billion as imports and the US's deficit with China both reached record highs.European stocks trimmed their early gains in sympathy with US markets but still closed the day higher. The relief rally that was set in motion by trade talk overnight offset early pressure from soft eurozone PMIs. The Italian manufacturing PMI dipped into contraction territory while Germany, France and the EU PMI all declined from September.Crude oil was down $0.39 to $63.30 per barrel.

 By Susan Heavey and David Lawder WASHINGTON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The United States and China are not close to a deal to resolve their trade differences, the White House's top economic adviser said on Friday, adding that he was less optimistic than previously that such an agreement would come together. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said on CNBC television that U.S. President Donald Trump, contrary to a report by Bloomberg, has not asked his cabinet to draw up terms of a China trade deal as he prepares to meet at the end of this month with Chinese President Xi Jinping. "There's no mass movement, there's no huge thing. We're not on the cusp of a deal," Kudlow told CNBC. He added that the administration had not seen any new offer from China. Asked if Trump had told his cabinet to draw up a deal with China, Kudlow said, "no, not specifically," adding that the Trump administration had already made its demands known to Beijing. Preparations for the Trump-Xi meeting in Buenos Aires were "a normal, routine run-through of things that we've already put together," he added. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative's office declined to comment on the Bloomberg report, while the Treasury Department did not respond to queries about it.  Hopes that the world's two largest economies would begin to resolve their bitter trade fight lifted global stock markets on Thursday after Trump and Xi spoke by telephone that day and expressed optimism about their forthcoming meeting.  U.S. stocks were down about 1 percent on Friday afternoon after rising earlier, pulled into negative territory by Apple Inc's  disappointing profit forecast, with Kudlow's comments extending declines.  Trump administration officials have said U.S.-China trade talks cannot resume until Beijing outlines specific actions it would take to meet U.S. demands for sweeping changes to policies on technology transfers, industrial subsidies and market access. The two countries have imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other's goods and Trump has threatened to extend the tariffs to the remainder of China's$500 billion-plus exports to the United States if the disputes cannot be resolved.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are trading higher this morning as the market rally begins what could be its fourth up day in a row. This week's optimism marks a key change in sentiment versus the depression plaguing stocks in October.Ahead of the bell, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 1% and S&P 500 futures are higher by 0.73%. Nasdaq-100 futures have added 0.05%.In the options pits, put volume continued retreating as optimism took hold over the three-day rally. Specifically, about 22.8 million calls and 18.4 million puts changed hands on the session.The growing disparity between call and put demand had a big impact at the CBOE. The single-session equity put/call volume ratio plunged to 0.51 - a two-month low. The 10-day moving average fell back to 0.68.Options activity continues to be heavy surrounding quarterly reports. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) options were active ahead of last night's earnings. Alibaba (NASDAQ: BABA ) saw renewed interest in anticipation of their report. Finally, Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) calls were hot after the stock surged on better-than-expected numbers.Let's take a closer look:All eyes were on Apple stock last night as it reported earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter. The maker of all i-Things beat the Street's earnings and sales estimates, but tepid forward guidance was all investors needed to hit the sell button. Currently AAPL stock is down 5.6% in pre-market trading.AAPL reported $2.91 earnings per share on revenue of $62.9 billion. Analyst estimates for both heading into the report were $2.78 and $61.57, respectively.With Apple stock being the one bright spot in a dismal environment of late you would think that its failure to launch on earnings would spell trouble for the market. But you would be wrong. Futures across the board are firmly in the green despite Apple's after-hours slip.On the options trading front, calls slightly outpaced puts on the day. Activity swelled to 136% of the average daily volume, with 776,349 total contracts traded; 57% of the trading came from call options.The $12.50 loss AAPL is currently suffering in pre-market trading is within the expected range of $14 that was priced in to option premiums ahead of last night's report. While shareholders are disappointed, a down gap is greeting them this morning, this is far from a monster move.Alibaba was a second big hitter stepping up to the earnings plate overnight. Chinese stocks have been hit especially hard in recent months over tariff woes, so hopes were high that a solid report from a potential leader like BABA could finally arrest the decline.The e-commerce giant reported earnings of $1.11 per share on revenue of $12.39 billion. The Street's initial reaction took BABA shares up as much as 5% pre-market.The downtrend gripping BABA stock since June has been relentless. Despite the earnings power behind this morning's up gap, I suggest treating it with the same skepticism that prior rebounds deserved. The 50-day moving average rests at $157 and needs to be vaulted above before buyers have a technical leg to stand on.On the options trading front, calls ruled the day as traders jockeyed for positions ahead of the report. Activity jumped to 202% of the average daily volume, with 485,853 total contracts traded. Calls accounted for 66% of the day's take.If the 5% gain holds into the open, it will match the expected move that options traders priced-in ahead of time. Like AAPL, this reaction is fairly muted and may fail in pulling BABA out of its overall downtrend.Earnings provided a shot of adrenaline for Fitbit this quarter. The fitness-tracker maker bested the Street's earnings and revenue estimates while maintaining its full-year guidance. FIT earned 4 cents per share on revenue of $394 million.Yesterday's 26% moonshot lifted the beleaguered stock back above all its major moving averages in one fell swoop. With its downtrend now dashed, buyers are flocking in on hopes that Thursday's jump will spark a sustainable ascent.On the options trading front, call demand dominated. Activity ramped to 368% of the average daily volume, with 90,854 total contracts traded. Calls claimed 63% of the total.The post-earnings volatility crush was on full display yesterday bringing implied volatility back to 73% or the 56th percentile. At current levels, traders are pricing-in daily moves of 4.5%As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold positions in any of the aforementioned securities. Want insightful education on how to trade?

5 Beaten Down Stocks of Spooky October With Upside Potential
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThroughout the brutal month of October, I have pointed out the relative strength in  Apple  (NASDAQ: AAPL ). While the bears eventually got Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and hammered favorites like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), they were never able to really crack Apple stock.Heck, the iPhone maker maintained its $1 trillion market cap with ease. Apple stock was down about 3% for the month of October, hardly worth batting an eye for long-term investors. The PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF (NASDAQ: QQQ ), however, fell more than 8.5% for the month. Short of a powerful two-day rally at the end of the month, the Nasdaq-tracking exchange-traded fund (ETF) would have been down 12%.Now just imagine the damage if Apple hadn't held up so well.Anyway, all of this predicated on whether Apple stock can now walk the walk after talking the talk. That is, let's see if it can rally - or at the very least, not fall - after the company reports earnings after the close on Thursday.It will join others, like Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ), another stud through the month of October, as shares actually rose 2.5%. CBS (NYSE: CBS ), EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG ) and U.S. Steel (NYSE: X ) will all report as well, but none will be bigger than Apple.
 Click to Enlarge  On the short-term chart of AAPL stock (adjacent) and the long-term chart (below), Apple stock is near a lot of key areas ahead of earnings and that makes it tough to trade.In the short-term chart, we can see Apple running into the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, as well as channel resistance (blue line). The 50-day acted as support on the way up and now it's a question of whether Apple stock has temporarily broken below it for October or if it will now turn to resistance.That largely depends on the reaction to Thursday's earnings report. If Apple can close above $223, it will put these key levels behind it, where they will hopefully become support. This will also open AAPL to a retest of the $228s and a chance at its 52-week high near $233.50.
 Click to Enlarge On the downside, we need to see if the 100-day and channel support can again buoy Apple. Below those levels, and the $200 level may come into play.It would obviously deal a devastating blow to bulls, but it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world for Apple stock to work its way down to the low-$190s. To get there overnight would require more than a 13% decline. I obviously don't expect that to happen.But a decline to this area would fill the gap from August, bring shares down to the 200-day moving average and down to channel support (blue line). In my book, that would be a buy, buy, buy! Particularly as we go into the always-impressive holiday season.So what's the bottom line here? Apple stock has been a stud through October. I would be a buyer on weakness into the $205 to $210 area, a decline of 3.5% to 6.5%. On a rally, see if we can close over current resistance. Both cases will give investors a reasonable risk/reward moving forward.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell .

What to Expect from the Stock Market After a Brutal October
After a brutal October  for the stock market, November couldn't come soon enough. Let's hope it brings more than just Turkey leftovers.Consider: Even following Wednesday's Halloween gains  to close the month, stocks still reeled in a scary October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  dropped 1,342.55 points, or 5.1%, its worst one-month loss since 2015, while the S&P 500  slumped 6.9%, its worst since 2011. The Nasdaq Composite  tumbled 9.2%, its worst drop since 2008. The two sectors that had been helping to drive the market higher-Information Technology, home to Apple  (AAPL) and Microsoft  (MSFT), and Consumer Discretionary, home to Amazon.com  (AMZN)-suffered their worst drops since 2010 and 2008, respectively.The good news is that November has a history of being A-OK for the stock market. Since 1928, the S&P 500 has averaged a 0.7% rise in November, according to Yardeni Research, making it the fifth-best month for the market. The S&P 500 has risen in 60% of the Novembers since 1928.Just because the odds favor gains doesn't mean they're guaranteed. October is also supposed to be a pretty decent month for stocks, and we've seen how that turned out. Still, a lot could go right for the market. Earnings season  will be coming to an end, and so will the commentary companies have been offering about the impact of tariffs. The midterm election season wraps up next week, allowing the market to start obsessing about something new entirely. President Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping are also set to meet in November, and while there's worry about more tariffs being implemented if no progress is made, any signs of thaw on trade could send the market shooting higher. If the negatives go away, or are at least dialed down a bit, stocks could rally again in November. Read more  : The Stock Market Really Needs Apple to Have a Good Quarter But then again, maybe not. Bay Crest Partners' Jonathan Krinsky noted that Wednesday was a weak up day, if such a thing is possible: Despite gaining 1.1%, only 301 S&P 500 stocks rose on the day, while 192 fell, the worst so-called breadth day for the index on a day it gained 1% or more since 2009. There have been 68 times when the difference between S&P 500 winners and losers was 125 or less, Krinsky noted, and the index has averaged a 1.3% decline over the next 20 days. "Given [Wednesday's] weak breadth rally, and weak close, the probabilities that we head back lower from here has to now be elevated," Krinsky said.Who knows? Maybe by the end of November there really will be a reason for thanksgiving, at least for the stock market. But then again, maybe not. Write to  Ben Levisohn at  Ben.Levisohn@barrons.com 
 By Shreyashi   Sanyal Nov 1 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were on pace for third straight day of gains on Thursday, leaving behind a brutal October, as improving risk sentiment globally was further boosted by a string of robust earnings reports. The rise in futures follows gains in Chinese shares on a new round of stimulus plan and European markets hitting an eight-day high. NXP Semiconductors  climbed 4.7 percent after the chipmaker topped profit and revenue estimates, while American International Group Inc  gained 2.6 percent after the insurer posted a smaller-than-quarterly loss.  "Over the past few days, we've seen the pressure valve taken off the selling which certainly helps from a sentiment perspective," said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. "Investors are starting November with a shopping list, because the last few days have reassured them that the selling isn't going to continue, it's probably over for now." Apple, last among the major technology names to report earnings, inched up 0.5 percent, ahead of earnings after markets close. October marked the worst month for the S&P 500  since September 2011 and the Nasdaq's biggest monthly fall since November 2008 as fears of rising borrowing costs, global trade disputes and a possible slowdown in U.S. corporate profits spooked equity investors. S&P 500 companies are on pace to have posted a 26.3 percent rise in third-quarter earnings with more than half of the constituents having reported, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Despite the big overall profit increase, some high-profile companies have issued disappointing reports. At 8:31 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis  were up 107 points, or 0.43 percent. S&P 500 e-minis  were up 9.25 points, or 0.34 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis  were up 19.75 points, or 0.28 percent. The CBOE Volatility index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, eased to more than seven-day low at 20.67 points. Health insurer Cigna Corp  rose 2.5 percent after beating quarterly profit estimates and raising its full-year earnings forecast on tight cost controls.  Shares in Spotify Technology  fell 10.1 percent after the paid music streaming service reported quarterly revenue and margins in line with expectations and a modest rise in premium subscribers.  On economic data, the Institute for Supply Management's report on manufacturing activity is likely to show national factory activity index falling to 59.0 in October, from 59.8 in September, due at 10 a.m. ET (1400 GMT). 
 
 By Shreyashi   Sanyal Nov 1 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks eyed a third day of gains on Thursday, leaving behind a brutal month of losses, as improving risk sentiment globally was further boosted by a string of positive earnings reports. The S&P S&P 500 futures  pointed to half a percent rise at the open following gains in Chinese shares on a new round of stimulus plan, while European stock markets hit eight-day highs also on strong reports. NXP Semiconductors  gained 4.6 percent after the chipmaker topped profit and revenue estimates. Apple, last among the major technology names to report earnings, inched up 0.7 percent. Its earnings are due after the market closes on Thursday. "A consolation phase is in place as the correction for this year is now behind us," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in a client note. October marked the worst month for the S&P 500  since September 2011 and the Nasdaq's biggest monthly fall since November 2008 as fears of rising borrowing costs, global trade disputes and a possible slowdown in U.S. corporate profits spooked equity investors. The CBOE Volatility index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, eased to more than seven-day low at 20.42 points. S&P 500 companies are on pace to have posted a 26.3 percent rise in third-quarter earnings with more than half of the constituents having reported, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. But despite the big overall profit increase, some high-profile companies have issued disappointing reports. At 7:32 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis  were up 148 points, or 0.59 percent. S&P 500 e-minis  were up 14.25 points, or 0.53 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis  were up 34.5 points, or 0.49 percent. Spotify Technology  fell 4.1 percent after the paid music streaming service reported quarterly revenue and margins in line with expectations and a modest rise in premium subscribers.  On economic data, the Institute for Supply Management's report on manufacturing activity is likely to show national factory activity index falling to 59.0 in October, from 59.8 in September, due at 10 a.m. ET (1400 GMT).

Mark Zuckerberg serves platter of creepy crawlies
 LONDON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - UK shares jumped to a three-week high on Wednesday as upbeat results from Standard Chartered  and Smurfit Kappa  provided some respite from a ghoulish October that put the market on track for its worst month since August 2015. The blue-chip FTSE 100  was up 1.3 percent at 1002 GMT, with energy and financials providing the biggest lift as results eased investor worries about slowing corporate earnings and Brexit. "This rebound could well be down to some end-of-month position adjusting. However, there have been some indications in the past few days that we might be starting to see a bit of a short-term base, with most of the bad news already priced in to some extent," said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. But on the home front, investors drew comfort from Standard Chartered's better than expected profit even as the Asia-focused lender warned that the escalating Sino-U.S. trade war was weighing on business sentiment in its core emerging markets.  The shares were up 4.6 percent. Smurfit Kappa, meanwhile, jumped 3 percent after the Irish packaging group reported consensus-busting earnings and announced an acquisition in Serbia. The news lifted peer DS Smith  by 4.9 percent to the top of the FTSE leader board.  Oil majors extended Tuesday's rally, with BP  up 3.7 percent. Prices boosted by a higher oil price as well as the previous day's bumper financial results. Among the handful of losers on the blue-chip board was retailer Next, down 3 percent after the British clothing retailer reported a slowdown in sales growth.  The news underscored concerns about the challenging business conditions on the high street, dragging down Marks & Spencer  with it. Elsewhere, William Hill's  bet on Swedish gaming company Mr Green triggered a rally in both stocks and the sector. William Hill, up 8 percent, topped a FTSE 250 index  that was up 1.2 percent. Computacenter  sank 17 perent after the IT services company delivered a tepid forecast for the final quarter.

Weak Amazon, Alphabet results ignite growth worries
 By Supantha Mukherjee and Sonam Rai Oct 26 (Reuters) - Shares of Amazon.com Inc  dropped by the most in four years on Friday after its outlook for holiday season sales missed targets, fanning concerns that Wall Street's tech darlings are finally starting to face stronger competition. The third-quarter results were the second time running that billionaire Jeff Bezos' firm had fallen short of sales targets and, allied to a similar disappointment from Google-owner Alphabet, they sent a shockwave through stock markets. The fall ofas much as 9 percent in shares knocked more than $80 billion off Amazon's market value and relegated it behind Microsoft Corp  and Apple Inc  in terms of market value. Now that the Seattle-based firm has devoured retail players like Borders, Sears and Toys 'R' Us, it is facing bigger challenges from multinationals who are making substantial investments to compete, D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Thomas Forte said. "Google, Microsoft, and Walmart ...  are more difficult to kill," he said. Shares in Alphabet dropped about 2 percent after it fell short on sales after beating estimates for the past eight quarters.  Revenue from Amazon's international business, which brings in 27.5 percent of total sales, was at the heart of the shortfall in results, growth halving to 13.4 percent compared to the previous quarter. "We don't see any real structural issue with Amazon but nearly every line in the business is decelerating a tad and we typically see another deceleration in retail in 4Q, hence are struggling to identify a catalyst," Barclays analyst Ross Sandler said. Wolfe Research analyst Scott Mushkin saw two possible reasons Amazon forecast a holiday shopping quarter weaker than anticipated by Wall Street. "They are worried about the macro. The second thing is they're worried about competition," he said, noting that there were both signs of a slowing economy and that major retailers were aggressively deploying strategies to compete with Amazon for holiday sales. Amazon expected sales in the holiday quarter leading up to Christmas to rise between 10 percent and 20 percent, to as much as $72.5 billion, while analysts on average had expected $73.9 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  Its operating profit forecast of between $2.1 billion and $3.6 billion also came in below consensus estimates. Several analysts called the company's outlook conservative and said any outright dip in profit seems highly unlikely. "Overall, Amazon's growth trajectory remains solid, including advertising, grocery, pharmacy, and specialty retail, as well as Amazon Business ($10 billion in sales in eight countries) and Amazon Web Services," Telsey Advisory Group analysts said. Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft all continued growth in cloud services but with signs of deceleration. In the latest quarterly reports, Microsoft's cloud computing business Azure marked revenue growth of 76 percent, down from 89 percent in the previous quarter. Google's other revenue, which includes its cloud business, grew 29 percent on year, 4 percent below estimates of Cowen & Co. analysts. Amazon's cloud business saw a 46 percent rise in revenue to $6.68 billion, only narrowly edging past estimates of $6.67 billion. "In general the cloud business will continue to grow but not at the previous pace and that's an indication of the market maturity," says Sid Nag, senior director, cloud technologies and services, Gartner Research. Shares of the company were down 7.2 percent at $1,654 in midday trade. 
 
Wall St sinks as Amazon, Alphabet earnings spark growth concerns
 By Amy Caren Daniel Oct 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks plunged on Friday as grim earnings reports from Amazon and Alphabet rekindled a rush to dump technology and high-growth stocks, but data showing economic growth in the last quarter slowed less than expected provided some relief. The Nasdaq dropped nearly 2 percent, sharply cutting its gains for the year and moving deeper into correction territory, while the blue-chip Dow shed 1.1 percent and the benchmark S&P fell 1.56 percent, putting under threat their slim gains for the year. Google-parent Alphabet Inc  sank 3.3 percent after its revenue missed estimates, fanning concerns that investments in new businesses, rising regulatory scrutiny and competition are producing slow returns.  That triggered a sell-off in other members of the so-called FAANG group. Both Facebook Inc  and Netflix Inc  dropped 2.3 percent and Apple Inc slid  1.5 percent. All of the 11 major S&P sectors were in the red, with the communication services  taking the steepest hit with a 2.06 percent fall and technology stocks  down 1.48 percent. "When the stocks that are carrying the markets begin to crack, investors are going take cover. Investors are waiting for more visibility for things to see where the rotation takes them," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. On the brighter side was data that showed gross domestic product increased at a 3.5 percent annualized rate in the third quarter as a tariff-related drop in soybean exports was partly offset by the strongest consumer spending in nearly four years and a surge in inventory investment.  "This is seen as a slight positive. There's less pressure on the Federal Reserve to do something (on interest rates)," Bakhos said. While U.S. economic growth kept apace despite trade wars, the same cannot be said of U.S. corporate profit growth, as a slew of disappointing forecasts this earnings season showed how tariffs, rising wages and borrowing costs as well as jitters over geopolitical events are hurting companies. At 9:56 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was down 274.85 points, or 1.10 percent, at 24,709.70, the S&P 500  was down 42.12 points, or 1.56 percent, at 2,663.45 and the Nasdaq Composite  was down 144.96 points, or 1.98 percent, at 7,173.38. A clutch of weak outlook on Wednesday pushed the Nasdaq into correction territory and erased the Dow and the S&P 500's gains for the year. On Thursday, Microsoft Corp's  strong earnings led a rally that pulled the S&P and Dow back into the black for 2018. Microsoft, whose strong results helped push the Nasdaq to its biggest daily gain since March just a day earlier, fell 1.2 percent. Intel Corp  defied weakness to gain 3.6 percent after its better-than-expected quarterly results, though interim Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan said trade tensions with China could be a "headwind" next year.  Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 5.14-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 3.38-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded no new 52-week highs and 51 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded three new highs and 173 new lows.

 By Amy Caren Daniel Oct 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures plunged on Friday as disappointing results from behemoths Amazon and Alphabet rekindled a rush to dump technology and high-growth stocks, ahead of data that will likely show U.S. economic growth slowed last quarter. The Nasdaq Composite was set to cut its gains for the year in half as Nasdaq 100 e-minis  sank over 2 percent. S&P 500 e-minis  and Dow e-minis  shed about 1 percent each, which would be enough to push both the indexes back into losses for the year. Google-parent Alphabet Inc  sank 6.1 percent after its revenue missed estimates, fanning concerns that investments in new businesses, rising regulatory scrutiny and competition are producing slow, unpredictable returns.  The reports triggered a pullback in other members of the so-called FAANG group. Facebook Inc  fell 3.3 percent, Apple Inc slid  2 percent and Netflix Inc  dropped 4.7 percent. A clutch of weak outlooks on Wednesday had led the Nasdaq to confirm a correction and erased the Dow and the S&P 500's gains for the year. On Thursday, Microsoft Corp's  strong earnings led a rally that pulled the S&P and Dow back into the black for 2018. "Risk aversion is alive and kicking on Friday, as weaker than expected tech earnings trigger the latest stampede and those still buying the dips once again get burned," Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at online forex broker Oanda, said in a note. "Earnings season has more to run, so there's plenty of time for companies to turn this funk around. But, as yet, they haven't given investors the boost they well and truly need." While investors grapple with a slowdown in the bumper corporate profit growth, they are now also faced with a scenario of U.S. economic growth also taking a breather after months of strength. U.S. GDP growth likely slowed to a 3.3 percent annualized rate in the third quarter, from 4.2 percent in the prior quarter, data at 8:30 a.m. ET (1230 GMT) is expected to show. "Today's number could give signs if we are close to peak earnings for U.S. corporates. Housing data and consumer goods durables data has been soft lately," said Sim Moh Siong, currency strategist at Bank of Singapore. At 6:56 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis  were down 239 points, or 0.96 percent. S&P 500 e-minis  were down 33 points, or 1.23 percent, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis  were down 164.75 points, or 2.38 percent. Microsoft, whose strong results helped push the Nasdaq to its biggest daily gain since March just a day earlier, fell 4.7 percent. Intel Corp  was up only 0.4 percent as its better-than-expected quarterly results were clouded by interim Chief Executive Bob Swan saying trade tensions with China could be a "headwind" next year.  The pullback in U.S. corporate and economic growth has heightened investors worries that a decade-old bull market may be ending and triggered a whipsaw in the market for the past few weeks. Despite Thursday's pop, the S&P is down 7.2 percent this month, on pace for its worst month in seven years.

"Risk aversion is alive and kicking on Friday, as weakerthan expected tech earnings trigger the latest stampede andthose still buying the dips once again get burned," Craig Erlam,senior market analyst at online forex broker Oanda, said in anote. "Earnings season has more to run, so there's plenty of timefor companies to turn this funk around. But, as yet, theyhaven't given investors the boost they well and truly need." While investors grapple with a slowdown in the bumpercorporate profit growth, they are now also faced with a scenarioof U.S. economic growth also taking a breather after months ofstrength. U.S. GDP growth likely slowed to a 3.3 percent annualizedrate in the third quarter, from 4.2 percent in the priorquarter, data at 8:30 a.m. ET (1230 GMT) is expected to show. "Today's number could give signs if we are close to peakearnings for U.S. corporates. Housing data and consumer goodsdurables data has been soft lately," said Sim Moh Siong,currency strategist at Bank of Singapore. At 6:56 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMc1 were down 239 points,or 0.96 percent. S&P 500 e-minis ESc1 were down 33 points, or1.23 percent, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQc1 were down 164.75points, or 2.38 percent. Microsoft, whose strong results helped push the Nasdaq toits biggest daily gain since March just a day earlier, fell 4.7percent.

 By Munsif Vengattil and Paresh Dave Oct 25 (Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet Inc  on Thursday missed analysts' quarterly revenue estimates for the first time in at least two years and reported continuing erosion of its operating margin, sending shares down almost 7 percent after hours. The tech company's third-quarter results fanned investor concern that big investments in new businesses, increasing regulatory scrutiny and emerging competition are producing slow and unpredictable returns. Overall revenue rose 21 percent to $33.74 billion, missing analysts' estimate by about $310 million, according to Refinitiv data. Google ad sales contributed 86 percent of revenue, but growth slowed to 20 percent from nearly 24 percent last quarter. "Google's earnings momentum remains strong," said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com. "But if you dig in a little deeper, there are cost pressures which are building up and are mainly responsible for this period's disappointment." The company attributed much of the slower revenue growth to unfavorable currency exchange rates. Lower ad pricing to contend with antitrust concerns, new privacy rules in Europe and increased competition from Amazon.com Inc  may have played a role too, financial analysts said. Non-advertising revenue, such as from sales of mobile apps and cloud computing services, also came in slightly below expectations. Those results combined with rising expenses brought down the company's operating margin to 25 percent from 28 percent a year ago. After falling as low $1028.77, Shares of Alphabet were down about 3 percent to $1,071.01 after hours from their close at $1103.59. Alphabet reported net profit of $9.2 billion, or $13.06 per share, compared with $6.7 billion, or $9.57 per share in the year-ago quarter. That beat the average analyst estimate of $10.45. Earnings were boosted by a lower tax rate and favorable valuation of the firm's investments in startups such as Uber Technologies Inc. 
 NEW BUSINESSES Alphabet has committed to providing cloud computing services and selling hardware over the last few years. It has also ventured into areas where commercial opportunities are nascent, including regions such as India and Nigeria and businesses such as self-driving cars. The Waymo operation in Phoenix is in the early stages of testing pricing, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on a conference call on Thursday, noting that some employers were sponsoring workers' rides. Priming Alphabet's newer ventures has been costly in terms of marketing and hiring, with about 5,300 employees added in the third quarter. Alphabet's cost of revenue was $14.3 billion in the third quarter, up 28 percent from a year ago. Capital expenditures soared to $5.3 billion from $3.5 billion last year, with 20 data center sites in development, Porat said. Google has posted strong revenue growth for several years as retailers flock to buy product image ads on Google's search engine and commercials on YouTube. But Google's cost structure has been disrupted by surges in usage of its services on smartphones, where the company splits ad revenue with technology makers such as Apple Inc, and smart speakers, where ads do not appear. Google has been fined $7.7 billion for antitrust violations in Europe over the last two years, and heightened attention on privacy, security, competition and the rise of artificial intelligence tools has led investors to fret about potentially costly regulatory scrutiny in the United States and elsewhere. The steady revenue growth had helped Alphabet weather an otherwise bruising last few months on the stock market for big technology and communications companies. Alphabet gained 5.8 percent this year before Thursday and traded at 24 times expected earnings over the next year. Shares of No. 2 online ad firm Facebook Inc, which faces questions about flattening usage limiting revenue growth, had fallen 12.5 percent and were trading at 19 times future earnings.

BE Semiconductor sees fall in Q4 revenues as weak markets weigh
China's Wingtech to acquire Dutch semiconductor firm Nexperia for $3.6 bln
 HONG KONG, Oct 25 (Reuters) - China'sWingtech Technology Co Ltd, the world's largest smartphone contract manufacturer, plans to acquire control of Dutch semiconductor firm Nexperia Holding for 25.2 billion yuan ($3.63 billion), it said late on Wednesday. Wingtech, a contract manufacturer for China's largest smartphone companies including Huawei Technologies  and Xiaomi Corp, said in a stock exchange filing it plans to pay 18.45 billion yuan to buy stakes from existing owners of Nexperia.. It had announced in September that it will spend 6.7 billion yuan to acquire another owner of Nexperia.. The plan to take control of Nexperia, a semiconductor component maker that was spun off from NXP Semiconductors, is subject to regulatory approval including from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Chinese regulators earlier this year thwarted Qualcomm Inc's$44 billion deal to buy NXP amid escalating trade tensions between China and the United States.  ($1 = 6.9426 Chinese yuan renminbi) 
 
  Facebook  's FB  slowing user base growth rate, primarily due to increased concerns over data privacy, is expected to hurt third-quarter 2018 results, which the company is set to report on Oct 30.    Facebook, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise      Facebook, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise    |      Facebook, Inc. Quote  Facebook provided cautious view for the second half of 2018. The company expects revenue growth rates to decline in the period. On a sequential basis, for both third and fourth quarter, revenue growth rates are expected to decline by high-single-digit percentages. Management also expects currency to be a headwind.    The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Facebook's earnings is pegged at $1.47, decreasing 7.6% year over year. The consensus mark for revenues of $13.83 billion represents an increase of 33.9% from the year-ago period.    Notably, Facebook has a solid record of earnings surprises in recent quarters, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 14.80%.   Growth Drivers Abound    Facebook has been benefiting immensely from the growing popularity of Stories across all its major platforms, with Instagram the taking center stage. Instagram and WhatsApp are the top two most popular Stories product in the world.    Instagram is Facebook's fastest growing division, based on its more than 1 billion monthly users and 500 million daily users. Further, 400 million people use Instagram Stories on a daily basis.    Currently, WhatsApp boasts a user base of more than 1.3 billion. Additionally, as confirmed at Facebook's F8 developer conference this May, WhatsApp Status has 450-million daily active users (DAUs) globally. Reportedly, WhatsApp business has a user  base of more than 3 million.    Moreover, Facebook Messenger had 1.3-billion monthly active users (MAUs) as of the last reported quarter. Furthermore, the company recently announced that it has 300-million daily active users (DAU) of Stories on its main platform and Messenger, on a combined basis.    The company's focus on building and nurturing 'community' is a key catalyst. Instagram has significant growth opportunities, driven by rapid proliferation of Stories, Direct and IGTV.    Furthermore, Facebook's strategy of developing Stories to support ads is expected to drive growth. The company is also well poised to benefit from the growing demand for videos across its platform.    Moreover, the company's intent to secure the platform is commendable. Increasing infusion of artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to increase Facebook's ability to remove bad content quickly.   What Our Model Says    According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates, if it also has a positive Earnings ESP  . The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.    Facebook has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.17%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  .   Stocks to Consider    Here are few stocks you may consider as our proven model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.    Himax Technologies, Inc. HIMX  has an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   .    HubSpot, Inc. HUBS  has an Earnings ESP of +57.58% and a Zacks Rank #2.    Apple AAPL  has an Earnings ESP of +1.06% and a Zacks Rank #2.  (NOTE: We are reissuing this article to correct a major   error. The original version, published earlier today, October 24,   2018, should not be relied upon.)  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric   Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.

STMicro suffers as signals slowing Chinese chip demand
 By Mathieu Rosemain and Gwénaëlle Barzic PARIS, Oct 24 (Reuters) - STMicroelectronics  shares sank on Wednesday after the Franco-Italian chipmaker, a supplier for Apple  and Tesla, signalled a slowdown in demand from China. STMicro's stock, which has lost close to a third of its value this year, was 8.6 percent lower at 1001 GMT, making it the worst performer of France's benchmark CAC 40  index. "We still face soft market conditions in China and some inventory corrections," Chief Executive Officer Jean-Marc Chery told analysts in a conference call, with reference to the sale of microcontrollers, one of STMicro's three main activities. Geneva-based STMicro is rebounding from earlier setbacks this decade after narrowing its product portfolio, cutting costs and reorganising production at its factories. STMicro, which competes in Europe against Infineon Technologies  and Dialog Semiconductor, has fallen in industry rankings over the years, knocking its shares and raising questions over its ability to remain independent. Chery's cautious comments follow disappointing outlooks issued by some of STMicro's peers, including bigger U.S. rival Texas Instruments  on Tuesday.  "Markets are rather nervous," Frederic Yoboue, an analyst at Bryan, Garnier & Co said. "The slightest of deviations is penalized." Although STMicro gave a weaker-than-expected revenue growth forecast for the fourth quarter, it maintained its bullish growth target for 2018, bolstered by strong demand for sensors from carmakers and smartphone manufacturers. Chery said he expected full-year revenues to grow by about 16 percent, after STMicro said its third-quarter net revenue rose 11.2 percent from the second-quarter to $2.52 billion. STMicro said its operating income rose by 38 percent over the period to $398 million, while its gross margin stood at 39.8 percent. It said it expects fourth-quarter revenues to grow by about 5.7 percent, with a gross margin of 39.8 percent.

 By Heekyong Yang and Ju-min Park SEOUL, Oct 24 (Reuters) - South Korea'sLG Display Co Ltd  said trade conflicts would undermine the global panel business, as it posted a 76 percent fall in third-quarter profit on Wednesday despite a seasonal price boost. Recovering Liquid-Crystal Display (LCD) prices ahead of the year-end holidays helped the Apple Inc  supplier swing to profit after two consecutive quarterly losses, but it said the trend was not expected to continue into the fourth quarter. "The LCD market is still expected to see double-digit growth in supply. As for demand, market volatility continues to grow, as macro uncertainties are aggravated by tariffs, trade frictions and foreign-exchange risks in emerging economies," LG Display Executive Vice President Don Kim told analysts. LG Display ranks second by unit shipments in the large LCD panel market after China'sBOE Technology Group Co Ltd, according to IHS Markit data released this month. It posted operating profit of 140 billion won ($123.2 million) for the July-September quarter, after two quarters of consecutive losses, helped by higher seasonal panel prices. The result beat an average forecast of 79 billion won from 10 analysts, according to a Refinitiv poll, but was still well down on the previous corresponding period amid a global supply glut. Revenue fell 12 percent from a year earlier to 6.1 trillion won. Prices for 50-inch (127 cm) Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) television panels began to rebound in August to $117 after hitting a record low of $109 in June, according to data provider WitsView, part of research provider TrendForce.  The costly OLED TV panel business turned to profit in the third quarter, supported by sales volume growth, LG Display said. The firm did not disclose the size of the profit. Eo Kyu-jin, an analyst at eBest Securities, said the OLED business was not doing enough to shore up profit and the seasonal price rise would peter out in the fourth quarter. With China's push into the industry and its miscalculations on panel prices, LG Display has seen tough times, cutting benefits for its employees and planning a voluntary redundancy programme.  The firm said it was developing foldable screens but would take time to commercialise them. ($1 = 1,136.5100 won)

US Stock Futures Unhinged by Disappointing Guidance, Asian Market Rout
US stock futures are under considerable pressure Tuesday as disappointing guidance from component stocks 3M ( MMM  ) and Caterpillar ( CAT  ) coupled with significant losses in overseas markets has positioned Dow futures to open more than 400 points lower. Selling erupted overnight with China returning half of Monday's gains and infesting European markets with tech and industrial stocks bearing the brunt of investors risk aversion.Global investors had plenty of excuses for selling equity assets from Italy's impending financial showdown with the European Commission, to Turkey's criticism of Saudi Arabia's murder of Jamal Khashoggi, to China's feeble attempts to jawbone their markets higher.In addition, earnings across Asia and Europe also disappointed with Apple ( AAPL  ) supplier AMS issuing downbeat margin outlook, France's Atos lowering its guidance and Renault missing revenue estimates. Additionally, Germany's Bayer plummeted 10% for Monsanto's Round Up link to cancer. Accordingly, Germany's DAX is down 1.86% and taking down other Eurozone bourses.Across the Atlantic, US participants are still absorbing a rush of earnings from Harley Davidson ( HOG  ), Lockheed Martin ( LMT  ), McDonald's (MCD), Verizon (VZ) and Xerox (XRX), most of which beat expectations but were unable to mitigate negative price action across Wall Street.On Tuesday's calendar is the October Richmond Fed manufacturing index, expected to decline to 24 from September's 29, followed later in the morning with the 4-week and 8-week Treasury bill auctions and the 2-year note auction at 1:00 pm ET.

Wall St tumbles as weak industrial forecasts add to sour mood
US STOCKS-Wall St tumbles as weak industrial forecasts add to sour mood
 By Jennifer Ablan and Munsif Vengattil NEW YORK, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc  shares jumped more than 12 percent on Tuesday after long-time critic and short-seller Citron Research said it had a change of heart and is now betting the electric automaker's stock will rise. The firm said in a research note that Tesla's Model 3 sedan is a "proven hit" and serious competition from other automakers for the plug-in car market has not materialized, marking a sharp reversal from its previous stance. Chief Executive Elon Musk has promised a Model 3 ramp-up will help make Tesla profitable in the quarter, and has said the automaker should not have to sell more shares to raise cash. But a number of Wall Street analysts say the ramp-up, added to other production promises and debt obligations, make some sort of capital raise likely. Citron's change of opinion came just a month after the Andrew Left-led firm sued Tesla and Musk, saying Musk fraudulently engineered his abandoned plan to take the carmaker private to "burn" short-sellers. Citron said it was not withdrawing its lawsuit against Musk and Tesla.  Left told Reuters: "I would not short this again. I understand that industry better and I think the company just turned the corner." The reversal does not necessarily signal a broader capitulation by Tesla's other short-sellers. Tesla short-sellers had been adding positions over the last week, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky of financial analytics firm S3 Partners, and the company has the second-biggest short interest behind Apple Inc. Tesla announced record quarterly car production earlier this month but warned of major problems with selling cars in China due to new tariffs.  "The numbers coming out of the company are too compelling," Left said. Tesla shares got another boost during mid-day trading following a tweet by Richard Pearson's Mox Reports, saying "numbers will be blowout." Investors have been rattled by Musk's abrupt turnaround on his go-private plan and other recent behavior including smoking marijuana on a live web show. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission called Musk's Aug. 7 tweets about financing for a deal "false and misleading" and accused him of fraud last month. Tesla and Musk settled with the regulator by agreeing to pay $20 million each and have Musk step down as chairman for three years. "While the media has been focused on Elon Musk's eccentric, outlandish and at times offensive behavior, it has failed to notice the legitimate disruption of the auto industry that is currently being dominated by Tesla," Citron said.

 By Amy Caren Daniel Oct 23 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures tumbled on Tuesday, as concerns over Saudi Arabia's political situation, Italy's finances and trade war fears hit risk appetite across the globe. Investors were keeping a keen eye on U.S. corporate earnings, with industrial bellweather Caterpillar, 3M  and Lockheed Martin  reporting results. 3M Company  also fell 7.1 percent after its third-quarter sales missed estimates. Profits of S&P 500 companies are expected to have jumped nearly 22 percent in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv data. But many investors are focusing on the outlook for future growth due to concerns over trade, rising costs and other factors. U.S. markets have been torn between solid earnings reports and worries about rising U.S. interest rates and global growth. The benchmark S&P 500  is on track to post its fourth day of decline, trading about 6 percent below record levels. "There are a number of underlying risk factors in the markets right now, be it U.S. interest rates, Brexit, Italian debt, trade wars or emerging markets," Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at online forex broker Oanda, said in a note. "These are all destabilizing factors and sentiment may finally be caving under the weight of it all." Saudi Arabia is facing international pressure to provide all the facts about the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Istanbul this month, adding the threat of sanctions against the kingdom to a list of market concerns. Investors worry that it may lead to retaliation through crude oil, although a Saudi pledge to keep markets supplied held down oil prices. Chevron  fell 1.3 percent and Exxon  declined 1.5 percent.  A dispute over Italy's spending plans and doubts about the leadership of Britain's prime minister, mired in a stalemate over Brexit, means investors are focusing on the likelihood of further political turmoil in Europe.  The downbeat sentiment continued from Monday when Wall Street started the session with gains, but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reversed course to trade lower, led by declines in financials and energy stocks. At 7:44 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis  were down 428 points, or 1.69 percent. S&P 500 e-minis  were down 43 points, or 1.56 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis  were down 133.5 points, or 1.87 percent. Even the high-flying FAANG group of stocks were not insulated from the broad-based declines. Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix  and Google-parent Alphabet  fell between 1.5 percent and 2.4 percent. Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft  and Intel  are expected to report results later this week. Harley-Davidson  rose 1.2 percent after profit topped Wall Street estimates and the company maintained 2018 shipments forecast.

  (RTTNews.com) - Super Micro Computer has said to its customers that it will conduct a review of its hardware for any proof of malicious chips as alleged by Bloomberg's recent report. "Despite the lack of any proof that a malicious hardware chip exists, we are undertaking a complicated and time-consuming review to further address the article," the company said in a letter to its customers. "We are confident that a recent article, alleging a malicious hardware chip was implanted during the manufacturing process of our motherboards, is wrong. From everything we know and have seen, no malicious hardware chip has been implanted during the manufacturing of our motherboards," the company confirms. The company also said the design of its motherboards are extremely complex, which makes it "practically impossible to insert a functional, unauthorized component onto a motherboard without it being caught by any one, or all, of the checks in our manufacturing and assembly process." "The complex design of the underlying layers of the board also makes it highly unlikely that an unauthorized hardware component, or an altered board, would function properly." Last Friday, Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) Chief Executive Tim Cook had called for Bloomberg to retract a story alleging Chinese spy planted malicious chips on its servers. In an interview with Buzzfeed News, "They need to do that right thing and retract it." "We turned the company upside down," Cook told Buzzfeed. "Email searches, data centre records, financial records, shipment records. We really forensically whipped through the company to dig very deep and each time we came back to the same conclusion: This did not happen. There's no truth to this." Bloomberg Businessweek earlier this month reported that Apple found "malicious chips" in its servers in 2015. According to the report, the data center hardware used by Apple and Amazon Web Services, which was supplied by server company Super Micro, was under surveillance by the Chinese government. However, Apple had denied those claims. Apple said it never found malicious chips, "hardware manipulations" or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server.

Spotify takes minor stake in music distributor DistroKid
 BEIJING, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Chinese search engine Baidu Inc  has become the first Chinese company to join an artificial intelligence (AI) ethics group led by top U.S. tech firms, amid wider political clashes over AI competition between China and the United States. The Partnership on AI (PAI), which counts Alphabet Inc'sGoogle, Apple Inc  and Facebook Inc  as members, is a body that develops ethical guidelines for AI research, including ensuring research does not violate international conventions or human rights. Last year China's industry ministry named Baidu as one of four national AI champions, and the search firm has invested heavily in autonomous driving and deep learning in recent years. The inclusion of Baidu in the group comes as Chinese and U.S. companies are looking to ramp up cooperation on AI, despite a looming political scuffle between the U.S. and China over technology transfers. Last year China laid out a roadmap to become a world leader in AI by 2025, with plans to invest roughly $400 billion in the industry in the coming years.  The ambitions have rankled the U.S. government, which has discussed plans to bolster security reviews of cutting-edge technology, including AI, over fears that China could access technology of strategic military importance.  China's AI roadmap encourages technology sharing between private, public and military research groups. Despite the clash, U.S. companies have expanded their AI presence in China while Baidu and other Chinese firms have launched AI research labs in the United States. Last month China's cyber ministry hosted Google, Amazon Inc  and Microsoft Corp  at its annual AI forum. All three companies have launched AI research labs in China over the past year, despite tightening censorship and data restrictions that limit the companies' involvement in the market.  At the forum, top government officials stressed that China's development of AI technology would be ethically conducted, adding that they have plans to retrain workers who lose their jobs to AI. 
 
SoftBank 'anxiously' monitoring Saudi Arabia situation -executive
 By Stephen Nellis SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct 16 (Reuters) - SoftBank Group  Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure said on Tuesday it is "business at usual" at companies backed by its nearly $100 billionVision Fund despite a tense situation with Saudi Arabia, which provided nearly half of the fund's capital. Claure spoke at a technology conference in San Jose, California for British chip design firm Arm Holdings, which was acquired by SoftBank Group in 2016 for $32 billion. Claure said SoftBank is "anxiously looking at what is happening" regarding the fate of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who disappeared after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last week. SoftBank's $93 billionVision Fund has become one of the primary funding vehicles for technology companies around the world. Saudi Arabia provided $45 billion for the fund, and unease over SoftBank's ties to the kingdom dragged down its shares earlier this week.  The shares recovered 2.88 percent to 9,862 yen by midday on Wednesday, but were still down around 8 percent from a month earlier. SoftBank is also raising a second $100 billionVision Fund. Earlier this month, Saudi Crown Price Mohammed bin Salman told Bloomberg that the country's Public Investment Fund would contribute $45 billion to the second Vision Fund. Claure declined to comment to reporters on whether SoftBank would accept the capital if it were offered. "There's no certainty," he said. "We don't have a date" for the closing of the second Vision Fund, he said. The Vision Fund acquired a 25 percent stake in Arm from SoftBank last year, among the fund's largest deals to date for SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son. The British chip design firm licenses its technology to chipmakers such as Qualcomm Inc  and phone makers such as Apple Inc  to power mobile devices and other technologies. The companies' chip designs have begun working their way into data centers, where they compete with Intel Corp. Arm Chief Executive Simon Segars said the company has been able to expand rapidly under SoftBank's ownership, hiring 2,000 people in the past two years for a total of 6,000 employees. He said Arm was still profitable but less so than when it was a public company and was working with other SoftBank Vision Fund Firms, for example by striking a deal with SoftBank-backed Sprint Corp  around so-called internet of things technology. "That saves Sprint from engineering something very similar to what we already had. That lets us both go faster," Segars said. 
 
Why the iPhone XR Could Be a Game Changer for Apple
 CHIBA, Japan, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Japanese electronics components firm Murata Manufacturing Co Ltd  expects shortages of tiny ceramic components to last for another two years, its CEO said, in what could be a bottleneck in the advancement of the global automotive market. Murata Manufacturing, an Apple Inc  supplier, is the world's biggest provider of multi-layer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs), tiny parts that control the flow of electricity in a variety of products including cars, smartphones and laptops. Demand for MLCCs has surged as an increasing number of electronic devices are installed in cars, resulting in supply shortages across industries including automakers and smartphone makers. Murata said MLCC supplies have been particularly tight in the automotive industry, forcing some customers to wait as much as four or five months for orders to be delivered. Several thousand MLCCs are needed per vehicle, compared to around 1,000 units per smartphone. MLCCs in cars are also much larger than those in smartphones. "As cars become more electrified and automated, MLCC demand is likely to expand over an extended period of time," he said. Murata Manufacturing controls about 40 percent of the global MLCC market, followed by Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co  of South Korea and Taiyo Yuden Co  of Japan. Murata Manufacturing has been adding production capacity of about 10 percent every year over the last decade, and plans for an increase of at least another 10 percent for the next year. The company has said it will be investing 220 billion yen ($1.96 billion) to boost capacity for MLCCs and batteries before the end of the current fiscal year in March 2019. "But we have limited resources. Our workforce and facilities have been stretched," Murata said. ($1 = 112.1300 yen) 
 
Netflix (NFLX) Stock Sinks 1.9% Ahead of Q3 Earnings: What to Watch
Selling erupted late on Monday, wiping out the Dow's fragile gains, as last week's carnage continued to plague risk averse investors. Weighed down by the diplomatic crisis between the US and Saudi Arabia, downbeat global growth forecasts by the International Monetary Fund over the weekend and soft retail sales, Wall Street struggled to recover early losses and overcome the recent correction.After a defensive start, the Dow crept higher at the open and held onto conservative gains within a shallow range. The day was punctuated by brief bouts of profit-taking: first on hawkish comments from former Fed Chair Janet Yellen, and again at the end of the day when headlines circulated that Saudi Arabia will admit to killing Jamal Khashoggi in what was called a botched interrogation.Technicals also played a role in Monday's price action as the Dow was supported throughout the day by its 200-day moving average, the S&P 500 orbited its 200-day moving average but the Nasdaq failed to break above its 200 DMA and underperformed the other major averages on losses in networking and hardware stocks.Economic data contributed to early losses as core retail sales contracted 0.1% in September, its biggest decline since May 2017. Nominal sales were up by just 0.1%, well below expectations for a 0.6% gain, while sales excluding autos and gas were flat last month, also missing the estimated +0.4%.In corporate news, beleaguered retailer Sears ( SHLD  ) finally filed for bankruptcy, ending its 125-year run as one of the US's largest retailer.Apple ( AAPL  ) shares were also under pressure after Goldman Sachs warned that Q1 guidance could be adversely impacted by "rapidly slowing" demand in China.On Tuesday's docket is September industrial production (est +0.2%) and capacity utilization (est 78.2%), the October housing market index (est unchanged at 67), and Aug JOLTS (est 6.905M)US MARKETSDow Jones Industrial Average was down 89.44 points (-0.35%)S&P 500 was down 16.34 points (-0.59%)Nasdaq Composite Index was down 66.15 points (-0.88%)GLOBAL SENTIMENTFTSE 100 was up 0.48%%Nikkei 225 was down 1.87%%Hang Seng Index was down 1.38%%Shanghai China Composite Index was down 1.49%UPSIDE MOVERS(+) EARS (+40.82%) To provide update on intranasal Betahistine program on Oct. 17(+) ACRX (+7.79%) FDA panel recommends approval of Dsuvia for treatment of acute pain(+) RKDA (+2.81%) Receives patent for extended shelf life wheat traitDOWNSIDE MOVERS(-) SHLD (-23.83%) Files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, will close 142 stores by year end(-) CVU (-16.53%) Announced $12 million stock offering(-) OXY (-6.13%) Qatar Petroleum will take control of Idd El-Shargi North Dome offshore oilfield

 By Medha Singh Oct 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Monday, coming off their worst five-day drop in seven months last week, as Apple led technology stocks lower and tensions between Western powers and Saudi Arabia added to already frayed investor nerves ahead of earnings. Among the biggest drags on the three major indexes was Apple, which fell 1.9 percent after Goldman Sachs said there were multiple signs of rapidly slowing consumer demand in China, which could affect demand for iPhones this fall. As the earnings season shifts into high gear this week, Goldman's warning on weak China demand only adds to fears about the impact of tariffs on corporate profits, even as borrowing costs are rising. These factors contributed to a brutal sell-off last week. "It's really just a continuation of what we have been experiencing in the first two weeks of the month and you are going to experience this for another week or two, probably until we are halfway through the earnings season," said Tom Martin of Globalt Investments in Atlanta. The first major earnings report this week was also not well received. Bank of America  dropped 1.7 percent as its better-than-expected quarterly profit failed to overshadow disappointing loan growth.  Also adding to nerves was the rising tension between Western powers and Saudi Arabia over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Saudi Arabia holds stakes in big U.S. companies and also finances SoftBank Group's$100 billionVision Fund, the world's largest technology investment vehicle. "Saudis have been fairly large investors in technology, one way or another, to the extent that if it sold out, that could weigh on the market," said Martin. At 12:21 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was down 50.98 points, or 0.20 percent, at 25,289.01, the S&P 500  was down 9.87 points, or 0.36 percent, at 2,757.26 and the Nasdaq Composite  was down 55.33 points, or 0.74 percent, at 7,441.57. Energy stocks  fell 0.6 percent as oil prices inched lower on concerns over long-term demand outlook. Crude prices got some support, however, from worries about Saudi Arabia, the world's top crude exporter.  Profits at S&P companies are expected to have risen 21.6 percent, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv, less than the growth in the past two quarters. The top gainers on the S&P were L3 Technologies, which jumped 10.7 percent, and Harris Corp, which climbed 9.5 percent, after the military communication equipment providers announced an all-stock merger to create the sixth-largest U.S. defense contractor.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 1.34-to-1 ratio on the NYSE, but declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.08-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded no new 52-week highs and six new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 10 new highs and 117 new lows.
