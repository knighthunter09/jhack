By Michael FosterDo you remember the biggest threat to the stock market in the summer of 2017?Let me refresh your memory: a nuclear war with North Korea.It was barely a year ago, but financial pundits and so-called experts were screaming from the rooftops about volatility spiking with the risk of a nuclear war. HereaEURtms what actually happened as Armageddon fears fizzled:Market Tunes Out PunditsaEURtm PanicSo much for heightened fears! In fact, despite unusually large spikes in volatility earlier this year, as a whole, this measure of market fears has been on a steady decline.Oh, and those spikes in volatility you see earlier this year were because of a new risk du jour. Mutually assured destruction through a nuclear exchange is yesterdayaEURtms newsaEUR"now the big risk is tariffs and the trade war with China, which drove the volatility spike you see in February.And that risk is rapidly disappearing.Of the S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings for the third quarter, 138 mentioned tariffs in any context at all, down from the 157 that mentioned them in the second quarter:Tariff Chatter on the WaneKeep in mind this is just references to tariffsaEUR"and also keep in mind that management loves to point the finger at anything outside their control if they have a bad quarter, and tariffs are a great distraction. But they arenaEURtmt leaning into that distraction as much as they used to, because tariffs are old news.We havenaEURtmt seen them affect GDP growth enough to be worrisome, and that should surprise no one. The 10% tariffs are on $200 billion worth of goodsaEUR"translating into an extra cost to Americans in the form of higher prices of about $20 billion. And since the countryaEURtms annual GDP is set to reach nearly $20 trillion in 2018, that means the tariffs affect a whopping 0.1% of the countryaEURtms total economy.Of course, that means anyone who sold off because of tariff fears made a huge mistakeaEUR"and thataEURtms obvious in the numbers. Even after the recent volatility, anyone who sold stocks because of fears that a trade war would result in economic disaster has missed out on 7.3% returns in less than a year:Strong Gains Despite the HysteriaNow that stocks have sold off in a temporary correction (an unsurprising turn of events after soaring 15% in just 7 months!), anyone who made the mistake of selling out on political fears and overblown alarmist headlines has a chance to fix their mistake and dive in.And thereaEURtms a way you can not only buy in but compound your potential returns from the recent selloff: thataEURtms with actively managed closed-end funds (CEFs) .The reason?Some CEFs that hold S&P 500 companies are trading at tremendous discounts, despite holding excellent stocks. Oh, and these funds pay much higher dividends than the 1.9% youaEURtmd get from the benchmark SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ) , meaning you can rely on them for income while the market rebounds.First, consider the Boulder Growth & Income Fund ( BIF ) , which pays a 3.8% dividend while holding some top-quality value stocks. BIFaEURtms biggest holding is Warren BuffettaEURtms Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) , but itaEURtms also invested in low-P/E-ratio stocks with a history of reliable dividends and strong free cash flow:BIFaEURtms Strong PortfolioSource: Boulder FundsDespite this excellent portfolio, BIF has a 17.4% discount to its NAV, even though its NAV has been growing faster than the S&P 500:Beating the Market Despite the DiscountOf course, some folks might take a pass on BIF when they can get a very generous 9.8% payout from a CEF like the Eaton Vance Risk-Managed Diversified Equity Income Fund ( ETJ ) . Fair enough!That 9.8% yield translates into $816.67 in monthly income per $100,000 invested, far above the $153.33 youaEURtmd get with SPY. And like BIF, ETJ is a mix of low-volatility, high-value stocks we all know, like Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Apple ( AAPL ) :Another Value PortfolioSource: Eaton Vance FundsThe catch? The discount to NAV here is much smaller than that of BIFaEUR"just 3.7%. But thataEURtms not too surprising considering the generous dividends shareholders are gettingaEUR"which may make this fund a good complement to BIF in a diversified CEF portfolio.LetaEURtms go with a third one to round things up. How about the Madison Covered Call & Equity Strategy Fund (MCN)?This is a very small and often-overlooked fund (itaEURtms got just $157 million in assets under management, making it a fraction the size of the multi-billion-dollar ETFs that get so much attention) that gives investors a huge 9.7% dividend yield. This fund trades at a 2.8% discount to NAV and, in addition to a variety of solid value stocks, has a fair amount of gold and mining stocks as an inflation hedge:MCNaEURtms Mix of Value and Inflation DefenseSource: Madison FundsFor a conservative investor whoaEURtms concerned about rising interest rates but still wants to cash in on the record earnings growth companies have seen in 2018, MCN is an attractive option. Combine it with BIF and ETJ and you have a solid all-around portfolio that gets you in the game while giving you an income stream most stock investors could only dream about.5 MORE Buys for 8%+ Dividends and 20%+ Gains in 2019I think itaEURtms very clear that a steady 8%+ cash dividend backed by a rock-solid human management team is exactly what you need to bank big gains in todayaEURtms market.And IaEURtmve got even better news for you: in addition to the 3 solid choices above, IaEURtmve got 5A MORE funds also delivering BIG dividends ( IaEURtmm talking 8%+ cash payouts here ) and upside, thanks to their ridiculous discounts to NAV.Take my No. 1 pick right now, which pays a hefty 8.1% CASH dividend and has absolutely demolished the market since inception:8.1% Dividends and Market DominanceaEUR"in 1 BuyYet despite that incredible run, this funds trades at a 4% discount to NAV as I write! That may not sound like much of a markdown, but this unsung dividend star has traded at fat premiums to NAV many times in the past.ItaEURtms only a matter of time before its premium returns, and when it does, it will catapult us to fast 20%+ upside, on top of our massive 8% dividend!LetaEURtms grab a position in this winner and the 4 other bargain-basement CEFs I have for you now, so we can start enjoying their 8%+ cash streams just ahead of their next big rise.All you have to do isA click here to get ALL my research nowaEUR"names, tickers and my complete analysis of all 5 of these funds .

The question now is can Facebook make a comeback or will its slide continue?Recent NewsFacebook's "fake news" and Russian interference scandals just keep coming. A New York Times report from Wednesday said that high-level Facebook executives overlooked signs of suspicious Russian activity on its platform. The story also noted that the embattled social media company tried to hide the scope of the problem to both the public and lawmakers, as well as try to push out negative stories about some of its fellow technology powers.The report said that Facebook hired an opposition research firm to release damaging reports about both Apple and Google. A fact that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg didn't dispute when he told reporters Thursday that the company has since parted ways with the firm Definers Public Affairs.The Silicon Valley titan's board also responded to the NYT report in a statement. "As Mark and Sheryl made clear to Congress, the company was too slow to spot Russian interference, and too slow to take action. As a board we did indeed push them to move faster. But to suggest that they knew about Russian interference and either tried to ignore it or prevent investigations into what had happened is grossly unfair."Clearly, the story is very complex and Facebook's woes don't seem like they will disappear anytime in the near future. But investors need to start asking themselves how these stories might really impact the company over the long-haul in order to determine what's best when it comes to owning FB stock.Facebook's SpendingThe number one issue that seems to have sent Facebook stock down amid this entire 2018 decline is spending. More than slowing user growth and worries that people mistrust Facebook, the true crux of the matter might rest on profit margins.Facebook executives, in a now infamous second-quarter earnings call that caused FB stock to tank, detailed how its operating margin would begin to slide as it spent more money to combat the problems plaguing the platform.Facebook projected that its operating margin would slip into the "mid-30s on a percentage basis" over a more than two-year period. We should note that this has already started to happen, as FB's Q3 operating margin fell from 50% in the year-ago quarter to 42%.The company has responded to these "fake news" and misinformation issues by upping its security and monitoring budgets. Zuckerberg has said that combating these platform manipulation problems will take years and billions of dollars to fix.Facebook even recently announced that it plans to set up an independent body to help it decide what to do with worrisome content. Yet, Facebook's CEO pointed out that the company has had to deal with huge changes before, such as moving from a PC-based platform to mobile.With that said, Facebook posted adjusted Q3 earnings that jumped 10% to reach $1.76 per share to crush our Zacks Consensus Estimate that called for an 8% year-over-year decline. Facebook's bottom-line beat and expansion came even as its costs and expenses soared 53% from $5.21 billion to $7.95 billion.OutlookLooking ahead, Facebook's fiscal 2018 revenues are projected to jump 36% to reach $55.33 billion, based on our current estimate. Jumping to fiscal 2019, the company's revenues are expected to climb roughly 24% above our 2018 estimate to $68.51 billion. Maybe more importantly, the firm's adjusted 2018 earnings are expected to jump 19.3%, while fiscal 2019's EPS is projected to pop just 1.4%.Bottom LineFacebook stock sat at roughly $138 per share through late morning trading Friday, down over 4% on the day and 37% from its 52-week and all-time high of $218 per share. FB's decline has it trading right near its all-time low forward P/E at 19.3X, which falls below its industry's 29.5X average and not too far above the S&P 500's 16.4X.The social media firm also currently estimates that more than 2.6 billion people use Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, or Messenger each month-or roughly 35% of the global population.Facebook closed Q3 with 2.27 billion monthly active users, up 10% from the third quarter of 2017. In the end, advertisers will continue to flock to Facebook as the likes of Netflix and Amazon steal more people away from ad-supported TV.Facebook could also theoretically start to pay a dividend at some point down the road. But the prospect of government intervention still hangs over its head and its stock price continues to tank. Therefore, even though many of the fundamentals are in place to help Facebook stock climb once again, it is hard to know when that might start with no bottom in sight. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:   Apple Partners with A24 Studio to Strengthen Content     Portfolio   Apple   is steadily building its film slate with back-to-back deals for its upcoming streaming service. Reportedly, the company has entered into a multi-year partnership deal with Oscar-winning indie studio, A24.The latest deal follows Apple's acquisition of global distribution rights for two "family-focused movies," Wolfwalkers  and The Elephant Queen  in September.Although it is not an exclusive deal, A24 will produce multiple movies for Apple. However, details of the transaction were not revealed. Is A24 a Good Catch for Apple? New York-based A24 studio is known for its ability to develop innovative content and support talented filmmakers. The studio's Moonlight  won the best picture award at the 2017 Oscar's beating La La Land.  Its Lady Bird  won 41 nominations  , including best picture, and 13 awards, including best motion picture in 2018.Therefore, it is no surprise that Apple, Amazon and Lionsgate among others reportedly made offers to buy A24, which were turned down by the latter.Notably, prior to the deal with Apple, A24 inked a deal with AT&T's DirecTV to jointly acquire a few films in the United States, with DirecTV holding the rights to offer films on-demand 30 days prior to their theatrical release. This significantly enhances A24's content portfolio.Additionally, A24 also partnered with Amazon to make its movies available on Prime post their theatrical releases. Apple Focuses on Developing Quality Content Apple has been on a spending spree to scoop up original TV and film content, featuring some of the biggest directors and actors in Hollywood to support the launch of its streaming service as soon as March 2019. Notably, the company planned to spend $1 billion on original programming in 2018 and is expected to spend $4.2 billion by 2022.Apple is continuously focusing on acquiring/partnering with Oscar winning content makers to create a place for itself. The company's recent deal with A24 also indicates how the company is targeting unique and appealing content in the age of big deals with top stars to draw audiences.The list of new Apple television programs includes a reboot of Steven Spielberg's original series Amazing Stories  ; an animated series from the Emmy-winning creator of Bob's Burgers  ; a world-building drama from Peaky Blinders  creator and Hunger Games  director; an untitled show starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon; a drama series by La La Land  director Damien Chazelle; a psychological thriller by M. Night Shyamalan and many more. Competition Remains Stiff However, competition is intensifying in the streaming market, currently dominated by Netflix, which intends spend $8 billion on content in 2018. The company recently said that it plans to raise another $2 billion in debt to finance original shows and movies and license content from others.Moreover, Disney, which owns Marvel, is gearing up to launch its own streaming service next year called Disney+. Notably, users will also have access to theatrical releases starting with the 2019 slate.Amazon Prime Video original content has also expanded in the last reported quarter with Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan  , The Romanoffs  and season 3 of The Man in the High Castle  . Further, Prime Video aired the second season of NFL Thursday Night Football ("TNF") in the third quarter and had more than 8 million viewers on Prime Video as well as on Twitch. The e-commerce giant is expected to spend roughly $5 billion on original programming this year.Although it might not be possible for Apple to grab market share from Netflix, Amazon and Disney instantly, the company's move in this direction is noteworthy. Moreover, the company's huge cash balance, which is approximately seven times the combined cash balance of all the three companies, gives it a significant advantage.Apple currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

How to Score a Cheap Smartphone This Holiday Season
 Black Friday shopping deals have arrived, which means now's a   great time to go shopping if you're in the market for a new   phone. Of course, the cheapest deals out there can be found going   the used or refurbished route, but that isn't the only way to   score a cheap smartphone.If you're switching to a new mobile service, starting a new   phone line with your existing plan -- or trading in an old phone   -- mobile carriers always get aggressive trying to earn your   business this time of year.  The new Google Pixel 3. Image source: Verizon. Verizon    is running a   buy-one-get-one deal    on select phones such as   Alphabet    's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL,   starting at $799 and $899; or the   Samsung    (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF)    Galaxy S9 and Galaxy Note9    , starting at $720 and $1,000. If Android isn't your thing,   Verizon is offering a free new   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL)    iPhone XR    or $750 off a second iPhone with the purchase of an iPhone X, XS,   or XS Max. The catch? You'll have to start a new line and pay for   the phones on monthly installments. AT&T    (NYSE: T) is running a similar deal on Samsung devices, offering   a second Galaxy Note9 at 75% off with a purchase. A new iPhone   purchase comes with a $700 credit toward a second one. The   company is also offering a $200 credit with the trade in of an   eligible phone.   T-Mobile    and   Sprint    are both running similar offerings on Android and iPhone   devices.The catch with all of those deals is you have to be a new   customer, or an existing one adding another line. All of them   also require signing up for monthly payments, and the phone you   receive is locked in at the carrier you buy it from. If you want   an unlocked phone, used at whatever phone company you choose,   there are better deals out there if you're willing to plunk down   some cash upfront.Over at the Google store, there's a deal to buy one and get   another 50% off on the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. Last year's   flagship model, the Pixel 2 XL, is starting for $699. That's $150   off the original price. Plus, trading in your old phone will get   you up to $400 in credit. Your new Pixel can be selected as an   unlocked phone, usable at any carrier.The Samsung and Apple stores aren't nearly as aggressive in   pricing, but a new Galaxy phone or iPhone purchase could get you   up to $300 or $500 off, respectively, with a trade-in.You can get the best deals by buying the previous year's   phones. You can still find new ones on   Amazon.com, Best Buy    , or your favorite online retailer.If you're an Apple user, a new iPhone 8 or iPhone X from last   year is at Best Buy for $100 off the original price. If you go   back two years to the 7, Best Buy still has a few for $500, a   discount from the original $770 going price.  The new iPhone XS. Image source: Apple.Same goes for other brands. The further back you go, the   bigger the discount on the phone. Over at Amazon, new original   Google Pixel and Pixel 2 phones are going for up to half off the   original price, as are Galaxy S7 and S8 phones.It may not be the latest and greatest hardware, but the   general rule of thumb is the "older" the new phone is, the bigger   the discount. The catch is you'll need to lay down the money   upfront -- but a fully unlocked phone usable at the mobile   service of your choice, no trade-in required, and at a steep   discount, can be yours.

Stocks Showing Significant Move To The Downside - U.S. Commentary
 By Medha Singh Nov 19 (Reuters) - Wall Street was lower on Monday as a slide in Apple shares due to demand worries hit the technology sector, while conflicting signals of a potential truce in the China-U.S. trade dispute added to market jitters. Shares of Apple Inc  fell 2.5 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported the company has cut production orders in recent weeks for all three iPhone models launched in September.  Shares of Apple suppliers were also hit, with Lumentum Holdings Inc, Universal Display Corp, Cirrus Logic Inc  and Skyworks Solutions Inc  down between 1.5 percent and 4.8 percent. The rest of the so-called FAANG stocks - Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc  and Alphabet Inc  - shed between 3 percent and 1.3 percent. Micron Technology Inc  fell 1.7 percent after a report that Chinese authorities have alleged "massive evidence" of antitrust violations by the world's top three memory chip makers - the latest industrial spat that threatens to upset global trade relations.  The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index  dropped 1.1 percent, extending losses from the previous session after an underwhelming forecast from Nvidia Corp  weighed on the sector. Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, led by a 1.9 percent decline in technology shares. At 9:52 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was down 96.70 points, or 0.38 percent, at 25,316.52, the S&P 500  was down 11.02 points, or 0.40 percent, at 2,725.25 and the Nasdaq Composite  was down 72.18 points, or 1.00 percent, at 7,175.69. Over the weekend, Asia-Pacific leaders failed to agree on a communique for the first time ever at a meeting in Papua New Guinea with U.S.-China trade worries on the forefront.  U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Saturday the United States will not back down from its trade dispute with China, and might even double its tariffs, unless Beijing bows to U.S. demands, dampening Friday's trade optimism that was fueled by U.S. President Donald Trump's comments.  "Markets are a little bit cautious with regard to the comments that Pence made over the weekend and the fact that they couldn't get a communique out of APEC meeting," said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. Boeing Co  and Caterpillar Inc, seen as trade sensitive stocks, fell 1.5 percent and 1 percent, respectively. China'sJD.com Inc  slipped 6.2 percent after reporting third-quarter revenue below analysts' estimates on sluggish sales in its core e-commerce business.  Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.30-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.58-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 22 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 11 new highs and 39 new lows.

  (RTTNews.com) - Apple Inc.'s ( AAPL ) Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has defended his company's decision to use Google as the default search engine on Apple products, including iPhones. He also said that regulation of tech companies is inevitable. In an interview with Axios for "Axios on HBO" airing Sunday night, Axios technology correspondent Ina Fried asked Cook why Apple accepts payments from Google for it to be the default search engine in Apple products and the Safari web browser. "I think their search engine is the best," Cook replied. Google pays billions of dollars to Apple to be the default search engine in Apple products, with a Bloomberg report estimating that the money Apple receives from its Google licensing agreements is between $3 billion and $9 billion. However, Cook added that Apple has implemented privacy features in its Safari browser to prevent Goolge from tracking a user's browsing history to collect personal information. "We have private web browsing. We have an intelligent tracker prevention. What we've tried to do is come up with ways to help our users through their course of the day," the CEO said. Cook admitted that while the controls built in by Apple is not a perfect thing, it goes a long way to helping. The Apple CEO also said that federal regulation of technology companies is inevitable. Cook said that while he's "not a big fan of regulation," companies have to recognize when the free market approach has failed. "I think it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation. I think Congress and the administration at some point will pass something," the CEO added. For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com 
  (RTTNews.com) - Stocks may move to the downside in early trading on Monday, adding to the steep losses posted last week. The major index futures are currently pointing to a lower open for the markets, with the Dow futures down by 52 points. Lingering concerns about the outlook for the global economy may generate some selling pressure along with uncertainty about the potential for a trade deal between the U.S. and China. At the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit on Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence said the U.S. would not back down until China changes its ways. The stark warning dampened investor hopes for a thaw in U.S.-Chinese trade relations ahead of the G20 summit later this month in Argentina. A pullback by shares of Apple ( AAPL ) may also weigh on the markets, with the tech giant moving notably lower in pre-market trading after a report from the Wall Street Journal said the company slashed production orders for all three of the iPhone models that were unveiled in September. Trading activity may be somewhat subdued, however, as some traders may be away from their desks ahead of the Thanksgiving Day holiday on Thursday. Not long after the start of trading, the National Association of Home Builder is scheduled to release its report on homebuilder confidence in the month of November. The housing market index is expected to edge down to 67 November after inching up to 68 in October. Stocks showed a lack of direction during trading on Friday following the substantial rebound seen over the course of Thursday's session. The major averages spent much of the day bouncing back and forth across the unchanged line before ending the session mixed. While the tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 11.16 points or 0.2 percent to 7,247.87, the Dow climbed 123.95 points or 0.5 percent to 25,413.22 and the S&P 500 rose 6.07 points or 0.2 percent to 2,736.27. For the week, the major averages all posted steep losses. While the Dow plunged by 2.2 percent, the Nasdaq tumbled by 2.1 percent and the S&P 500 slumped by 1.6 percent. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher during trading on Monday. Japan'sNikkei 225 Index and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index both advanced by 0.7 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index jumped by 0.9 percent. The major European markets have also moved to the upside on the day. While the U.K.'sFTSE 100 Index has climbed by 0.6 percent, the French CAC 40 Index is up by 0.2 percent and the German DAX Index is up by 0.1 percent. In commodities trading, crude oil futures are slipping $0.21 to $56.25 a barrel after ending last Friday's trading unchanged at $56.46 a barrel. Meanwhile, an ounce of gold is trading at $1,221.10, down $1.90 from the previous session's close of $1,223. On Friday, gold climbed $8. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 112.80 yen compared to the 112.83 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Friday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1430 compared to last Friday's $1.1415. For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com

Apple cuts production orders for all 3 new iPhone models
 Nov 19 (Reuters) - IPhone maker Apple Inc  has cut production orders in recent weeks for all three iPhone models launched in September, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing sources. A lower-than-expected demand for the new iPhones and Apple's decision to offer more models has made it more difficult to anticipate the number of components and handsets the company needs, according to the (graphic). Apple shocked investors a few weeks ago with a lower-than-expected sales forecast for the Christmas quarter, prompting certain suppliers to issue warnings that pointed to weakness in new iPhone sales.  As recently as last week, Apple informed several suppliers that it lowered its production plan again for iPhone XR, the Journal reported. The company started selling its latest phone generation, the iPhone XS and XS Max, in September and the XR model in October. Apple did not respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours. 
 
Thai proposal for all-powerful cyber agency alarms businesses, activists
 By Patpicha Tanakasempipat BANGKOK, Nov 16 (Reuters) - A proposed cybersecurity law in Thailand would give a new government agency sweeping powers to spy on internet traffic, order the removal of content, or even seize computers without judicial oversight, alarming businesses and activists. Civil liberties advocates, internet companies and business groups are protesting the planned legislation, saying it sacrifices privacy and the rule of law, according to interviews and documents reviewed by Reuters. It would grant a newly created National Cybersecurity Committee (NCSC) the authority to access the computers of individuals or private companies, make copies of information, and enter private property without court orders. Criminal penalties would be imposed for those who do not comply. The NCSC could also summon businesses or individuals for interrogation and force them to hand over information belonging to other parties. "Cybersecurity policy should be respective of privacy and rule of law," the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council said in letter to the Thai government that was not released publicly but was obtained by Reuters. "Enforcing cyberspace cannot come at the cost of sacrificing privacy, civil liberties, and rule of law." The letter also warned requirements such as forcing companies to alert the agency of cyber threats or even anticipated ones would impose "a very heavy burden" on businesses and should be removed. Tech giants Google, Apple, Facebook  and Amazon  are all members of the council. The Singapore-based industry group Asia Internet Coalition (AIC), which represents the four U.S. giants and seven other major internet companies, also warned the law might drive businesses out of Thailand. The AIC, in a public statement, cited concerns about government surveillance and criminal liability for defying NCSC orders, among other issues. Somsak Khaosuwan, Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Digital Economy, which is in charge of the law, told Reuters  the government is now discussing revisions of the draft and would take the concerns into account. "The law will conform to international standards... The team working on the law will certainly listen to the issues that have been raised," Somsak said. "There is nothing scary about it," he added, declining to elaborate on possible revisions. The draft law does not contain specific provisions on hot-button issues such as "fake news" or requirements that international tech and social media firms store data locally. Internet companies are currently battling governments over such issues in countries including India, Vietnam and Indonesia. But the Thai law would grant the new NCSC "sweeping powers, holding a monopoly on all things cyber in the country... without being subject to check and balance, control, or regulation," said Sutee Tuvirat, a cybersecurity expert with Thailand'sInformation Security Association. "If anyone is more powerful than the Prime Minister, this is it." 
 CENSORSHIP FEARS Civil rights advocates worry Thailand's military junta, which actively censors the internet and often casts criticism of the government as a threat to national security, will use the new law to further codify its censorship regime. The NCSC would be empowered to order removal of "cyber threats" and override other laws when they are in conflict. The latest draft of Thailand's new Data Protection Law, also expected to be approved this year, correspondingly says it does not apply to "national security agencies," including the NCSC. Arthit Suriyawongkul, a civil rights advocate with the Thai Netizen Network, told Reuters the law could readily facilitate censorship. "The law doesn't categorise data, which may include online content, and does not include protection measures," he said. In a joint statement seen by Reuters, the Telecommunications Association of Thailand and the Thai Internet Service Provider Association also said they were concerned about the government's efforts to "regulate content". Data from internet companies shows Thai government requests  to take down content or turn over information have ramped up in recent years. A law prohibiting criticism of the monarchy has often been the basis for such requests. Following the death of revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej in 2016, the government threatened to prosecute Facebook in Thailand if it didn't comply with content restriction requests. In the first half of 2018, Facebook restricted 285 pieces of content, almost all of which were alleged to violate local lèse-majesté laws, according to the company's latest transparency report released on Friday. Facebook restricted 365 pieces of content last year, 10 times the amount in 2014. It also handed over user data to the Thai government for the first time in 2017. From mid-2014 to the end of 2017, the military government has made 386 requests to Google to remove 9,986 items, almost all of which were identified as government criticism, according to Google's transparency report. Google agreed to remove content named in 93 percent of the requests last year, up from 57 percent in late 2014. Facebook declined to comment. It has previously said its general guidelines on receiving government requests to remove content are to determine whether the material violates local laws before restricting access. Google declined to comment. 
 
 By Barbara Lewis and Martinne Geller LONDON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Nespresso, part of food giant Nestle, aims to use sustainable aluminium in all of its coffee capsules by 2020 under a deal with mining major Rio Tinto, announced on Monday. Both companies have faced criticism for adding to pressure on the planet, with campaigners saying Nespresso coffee machines are wasteful and many of the used capsules end up in landfill. The companies are seeking to position themselves as sustainable to boost their investor and customer appeal, and Nespresso has committed to 100 percent sustainable aluminium for its capsules by 2020, Rio Tinto said in a statement released on Monday Australia time. Rio Tinto Chief Executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques said last month that miners needed new partnerships as the sector competes for talent and seeks to improve its image.  Its aluminium assets use hydropower - for economic as well as environmental reasons - and in April the miner became the world's first producer of aluminium to be certified by the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI). ASI standards are based on protecting biodiversity, respecting indigenous peoples' rights and traceability throughout the supply chain, as well as lower emissions and renewable energy. So far, only part of Rio's aluminium production is ASI-certified. Rio Tinto Vice President Sales and Marketing Tolga Egrilmezer said in an interview that the deal with Nespresso was "a significant milestone for the industry" towards wider use of responsibly-sourced aluminium. While the mining sector has recovered from the commodity crash of 2015-16, it is struggling to win investment because of concerns about governance in difficult regions where mines are often located and because of its exposure to coal, the most carbon-intensive fuel. Rio Tinto has sold its coal mines, but still uses coal power in some operations. In May, Rio Tinto announced a venture with aluminium maker Alcoa  and Apple  on technology to eliminate direct greenhouse gas emissions from the aluminium smelting process. Rio has already supplied aluminium to Nespresso, but is not its exclusive supplier. Nespresso said in an email it would take time for all capsules to be ASI-certified but it was working with its manufacturers to achieve this and on making recycling as easy as possible. Holder of nearly a third of the coffee pod market, Nespresso faces competition from other companies marketing themselves as sustainable. British coffee brand Halo said on Friday it had created "the world's first fully home compostable paper-based coffee capsule and packaging," which can break down in about a month. 
 
 Over the past several years, rumors have spread that   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) is working on a secret car initiative called   Project Titan that could launch the company squarely into the   autonomous vehicle market    -- when and if Titan comes to market.The narrative surrounding Apple's car project has shifted   several times. There have been reports that the company has   pivoted from developing its own Apple-branded cars to developing   an autonomous driving system, and even rumors that the company   has scaled back and perhaps even scrapped its car ambitions.So what's the latest news with Apple's Project Titan?   MacReports   reported    in July of this year that Apple had permits to drive 66   autonomous vehicles on California's roads and approval for   at least 111 "safety drivers," according to records from the   state's Department of Motor Vehicles. (A safety driver is the   person who sits behind the wheel of an autonomous car that is   being tested in order to take over if something goes wrong.) As   of early 2018, the company had just 27 autonomous vehicles being   tested.  Image source: Getty Images.And back in August, John Gruber of technology blog Daring   Fireball confirmed that Doug Field, Apple's former VP of Mac   hardware engineering, had come back to the company, presumably to   work on Project Titan after being in charge of   Tesla    's Model 3 production since 2013. That news stoked the rumor that   Apple wants to develop its own car, rather than merely an   autonomous driving system.The autonomous vehicle permits, safety drivers, and recent   rehiring of Field indicate that despite   major setbacks in the past    , the company is still pursing a autonomous vehicles system.Of course, Apple has been pretty quiet about the secret   project, but the company has shown its hand a few times.The first admission that the company was likely working on an   autonomous car project came from Apple CEO Tim Cook when he told   Bloomberg     this in 2017:Clearly, one purpose of autonomous systems is self-driving     cars -- there are others. And we sort of see it as the     mother of all AI projects. ... It's probably one of the     most difficult AI projects to work on. So autonomy is something     that is incredibly exciting for us. But we'll see where it     takes us -- we're not really saying from a product point of     view what we'll do. It's a core technology that we view as very     important.Of course, Cook didn't want to say precisely what Apple will   use its autonomous tech for, but some more details were   inadvertently revealed recently when a former Apple employee was   caught stealing plans for a self-driving car circuit board from   Apple earlier this year.Besides the fact that confirmed that Apple was working on   self-driving car hardware, a complaint filed by Apple also said   that 5,000 employees know about the car project and that 2,700 of   those are "core employees."Considering that nothing is set in stone for Apple's car   project right now, how exactly Apple will benefit is still a bit   of a mystery. But there are two emerging scenarios for how this   will pay off for Apple.The first is that Apple will sell its own branded car, as in   an actual Apple car that the company sells directly to consumers.   Longtime Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo leans toward this theory and   expects the car to launch sometime between 2023 and 2025 and   become the company's "next star product."The other school of thought is that Apple is developing   autonomous vehicle technology to license to automakers. This   strategy makes much more sense to me, given Apple's experience   with software and devices.  Image source: Getty Images.Licensing an autonomous system to automakers and companies for   self-driving cars is similar to what   Alphabet    's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Waymo is doing with its   self-driving car project. The company's autonomous software is   far ahead of Apple's     right now, and Alphabet already has a public test program   for its autonomous vehicles, modified Chrysler Pacifica Minivans   and Jaguar I-pace sedans, and will launch a commercial   self-driving car service by the end of 2018    .The fact of the matter is that if Apple can get the autonomous   vehicle system right, it could eventually become a significant   competitor with Waymo and provide automakers with more choices to   develop their autonomous cars.Autonomous vehicles are expected to hit a tipping point in   2021, where many automakers will begin releasing their own   self-driving cars (in limited amounts and mainly for ride-hailing   services), and   IHS Markit    forecasts that by 2040 new autonomous vehicle sales will surpass   33 million annually.Apple's services segment could see huge gains from the   autonomous vehicle market, which   Intel    estimates will grow into a   $7 trillion market by 2050    .With other tech rivals like Alphabet focusing a lot of their   attention on autonomous vehicles, it would be a mistake for   investors to think that Apple isn't trying to benefit from this   market as well. Waymo   could be worth $70 billion by 2030    , according to some estimates, and much of that potential value   comes from the company's projected use of its autonomous vehicle   tech to earn money from self-driving services.Apple is most likely pursuing autonomous software rather than   an actual vehicle. For example, Tesla has proved that building   cars is no easy task. And even partnering with an automaker to   release a car would leave Apple without the end-to-end control it   typically likes to have.No matter which avenue Apple is pursuing, investors should   keep in mind that it's going to take years for the company to   benefit from its car project. If Apple successfully launches an   autonomous technology that can be licensed to automakers, it'll   likely be a product worth waiting for. Just remember to play the   long game with this one.

 There's a lot of buzz about the imminent industrywide   transition to   5G    wireless networks, and chip giant   Intel    (NASDAQ: INTC) is one of the many companies that's been quite   vocal about the opportunity that this transition could   represent.Intel has a dedicated 5G landing page, for example, on which   it says that "5G will transform industries from all business   sectors, initiating ripples of impact that will spur market   growth and the global economy -- the heart of The 5G Effect."   (Yes, the company seems to be laying it on thick.)  Image source: Intel.Let's take a closer look at some ways Intel is set to profit   from the 5G transition.Over the years, Intel has established itself as a credible   supplier of cellular modems. Although the vast majority of the   company's modem revenue comes from sales of stand-alone modems   into   Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone product line, the company says its modem   portfolio also targets "tablets, PCs, and Internet of Things   (IoT) devices." Fast Company recently reported    that Apple will use Intel's first commercial 5G modem -- known as   the   XMM 8160    -- in its 2020 iPhone lineup. I also expect that Apple will   eventually transition the cellular versions of its iPad product   line to Intel 5G modems, too. (However, that opportunity is much   smaller than the iPhone opportunity since iPads are much   lower-volume products to begin with than iPhones, and not all   iPads are sold with cellular connectivity.)Additionally, Intel's Cormac Conroy, the general manager of   the company's Communications and Devices group, told   Fierce Wireless    that the company's XMM 8160 is being incorporated "into a   smartphone reference design, sporting an applications processor   from supplied [sic] Unisoc Communications (formerly   Spreadtrum).""Conroy said the offering would be available in the first half   of 2020 and is designed to push Intel's 5G modem into the midtier   portion of the smartphone market,"   Fierce Wireless    wrote.One area that's been delivering a lot of growth for Intel's   data center group (DCG) business -- its second largest by revenue   and total profits -- is sales of processors and related   components to communications service providers.Last quarter, for example, Intel reported that its revenue   from communications service providers grew 30% over the same   period a year ago, slightly outpacing the roughly 25.9% growth   achieved by the company's overall DCG revenue. (Intel's sales   into the enterprise and government segment were up just 1%, which   diluted the growth that Intel saw to both communications service   providers and to cloud service providers, the latter of which was   up 50% year over year.)At the company's Data Centric Innovation Summit event back in   August, Intel's Dan Rodriguez, the general manager of Intel's   communications infrastructure segment, claimed that the total   addressable market that the company will be going after in   network infrastructure will be worth $24 billion by 2022.During that presentation, Rodriguez claimed that the company   has:... driven with our partners over 25 5G trials, and due to     those trials, plus the momentum that we have on LTE networks,     the design wins that we've won in 5G, Intel is tracking to the     leadership position in 5G wireless infrastructure.  10 stocks we like better than Intel       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Quote   Apple Focuses on Developing Quality Content      Apple has been on a spending spree to scoop up original TV and   film content, featuring some of the biggest directors and actors   in Hollywood to support the launch of its streaming service as   soon as March 2019. Notably, the company planned to spend $1   billion on original programming in 2018 and is expected to spend   $4.2 billion by 2022.        Apple is continuously focusing on acquiring/partnering with Oscar   winning content makers to create a place for itself. The   company's recent deal with A24 also indicates how the company is   targeting unique and appealing content in the age of big deals   with top stars to draw audiences.        The list of new Apple television programs includes a reboot of   Steven Spielberg's original series   Amazing Stories    ; an animated series from the Emmy-winning creator of   Bob's Burgers    ; a world-building drama from   Peaky Blinders    creator and   Hunger Games    director; an untitled show starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese   Witherspoon; a drama series by   La La Land    director Damien Chazelle; a psychological thriller by M. Night   Shyamalan and many more.     Competition Remains Stiff      However, competition is intensifying in the streaming market,   currently dominated by Netflix   NFLX    , which intends spend $8 billion on content in 2018. The company   recently said that it plans to raise another $2 billion in debt   to finance original shows and movies and license content from   others.        Moreover, Disney   DIS    , which owns Marvel, is gearing up to launch its own streaming   service next year called Disney+. Notably, users will also have   access to theatrical releases starting with the 2019 slate.        Amazon Prime Video original content has also expanded in the last   reported quarter with Tom Clancy's   Jack Ryan    ,   The Romanoffs    and season 3 of   The Man in the High Castle    . Further, Prime Video aired the second season of NFL Thursday   Night Football ("TNF") in the third quarter and had more than 8   million viewers on Prime Video as well as on Twitch. The   e-commerce giant is expected to spend roughly $5 billion on   original programming this year.        Although it might not be possible for Apple to grab market share   from Netflix, Amazon and Disney instantly, the company's move in   this direction is noteworthy. Moreover, the company's huge cash   balance, which is approximately seven times the combined cash   balance of all the three companies, gives it a significant   advantage.

Apple's Latest Original Content Partner Is Indie Studio A24
 Indie film studio A24 has been on a roll in recent years,   racking up 24 Oscar nominations to date across all   categories, including taking home an Oscar for Best Picture in   2017 for   Moonlight    , among other awards. A24 was also responsible for other hit   films like   Lady Bird    ,   Ex Machina    , and   Room    . A24 was launched just six years ago, and has garnered   considerable accolades since.That growing reputation has apparently attracted   Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL) attention.  Image source: Apple.First reported by    Variety     but subsequently corroborated by   CNBC    and other outlets, Apple has struck a multiyear deal with A24 to   produce original films for its   forthcoming video-streaming service    . No financial terms have been disclosed, and it's unclear how   many films A24 may produce for the tech giant, and whether the   films would be released in theaters.Dominant video-streaming platform   Netflix    has long been averse to releasing its original films in theaters,   instead preferring to use its content to entice consumers to   subscribe. That approach has earned the ire of many in the   industry, and the company is finally changing its theatrical   release strategy. It's worth noting that a theatrical release is   also often a requirement for many prominent awards,   including the Oscars.Most of the content that Apple has been buying up in Hollywood   are TV series, making this new partnership among its more   significant steps toward full-length feature films. Apple   confirmed in September    that it had acquired the rights to two original animated movies,   one of which was made by Oscar-nominated animation studio Cartoon   Saloon. Apple is definitely going for high-quality content, and   is willing to pay for it.The deal will not affect other existing distribution deals   that A24 has with companies like   AT&T    's DIRECTV or   Amazon.com    , and A24 will continue producing other movies, according to   Variety    . Apple was reportedly even considering acquiring A24 before   choosing to partner instead.Many questions remain around Apple's strategy, although it is   reportedly planning on giving away its original content   for free    to Apple device owners through its TV app. That move would be   designed to bolster usage and engagement of the platform, while   establishing itself as a meaningful player in the entertainment   and media space. Inevitably, Apple would look to introduce a paid   subscription service later on as part of its ongoing efforts to   grow its services business.The tech behemoth now has   330 million paid subscriptions    within its services business, including third-party   subscriptions. CEO Tim Cook gave the   most public confirmation    over the summer that it is indeed working on a video-streaming   service, as well as some insight into his thinking. "Cord-cutting   in our view is only going to accelerate and probably accelerate   at a much faster rate than is widely thought," Cook said.

Exxon Mobil Stock Is Under Pressure — Is It Ready to Rally?
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast October, investors decided that the price of crude oil was too cheap, so they bought it up to $75 per barrel. This was a an impressive 150% rally from the lows of January 2016. As usual, the rhetoric quickly flipped uber bullish and the pendulum swung too far in that direction, buoying names like Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM ).The oil bulls immediately called for even higher prices. I went on record that that the fair price should be closer to $55 per share and that rhetoric alone was responsible for the sharp rise not the increase in demand.The leaders who are in charge of oil do manipulate prices. Recently OPEC averred that they are pumping as much as they could and prices fell apart as they did. Investors panicked out of the oil trade, bringing it back down to below $60 per share. This also caused a 10% drop in quality names like Exxon Mobil stock.So the question now - is this the bottom in crude oil price? I know we are closer to a bottom but not necessarily at it. Around $50 per barrel would be the 50% retracement from the lows of October of 2016, so there still is room to fall depending on rhetoric.Unlike the price of oil, energy stocks like XOM have not been as wild. They traded in a consistent horizontal range over the past five years. Exxon Mobil stock is down 3% in a year and most of it came in the past month.Fundamentally, the company is not cheap. It sells at a 19 price-to-earnings ratio. While this is in line with its competition say Chevron (NYSE: CVX ), it's too expensive relative to the alternative investments. For example this is priced the same as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). I am not comparing the two from a business standpoint, but rather from a money-opportunity perspective. One has the prospect of growth while the other one is an energy company.Last February, XOM stock fell off a cliff with the rest of the stock Market. Luckily the bulls were able to rally back almost all the way by October only to fall off the same cliff again back down to $76 per share.So at this point, is it time to buy XOM stock for another $10 bounce? Therein lies an opportunity indeed, but…As tempting as that is, there are problems looming. We have global leaders threatening to derail this expansion period with tariff wars mainly between China and the United States. Central banks are also at the tail end of their quantitative easing programs. The United States Fed Reserve is already in a hurried tightening cycle.So these uncertainties have caused the stock market to have an official correction and teeter on the brink of a recession. We are now far from the highs and bouncing along a floor board. If it breaks, it would open another trapdoor lower for XOM stock.Exxon has a similar line at $76 per share for its own chart. If the bears are able to break it, then $72 per share can come fast. This is not a forecast but a realistic scenario that could unfold in days.So instead of jumping in long now to grab a handful of stock, I would rather wait for the next two weeks to at least see the outcome of the G20 meeting. If my portfolio is out of balance and in need of a new position then I could nibble with a partial position to relieve the itch of investment. But going full position immediately right here is making a statement where the argument is weak.Technically, it is encouraging to see $76 hold a support several times. But every bounce off of it creates a chip in its foundation, especially when the stock is not forming a descending wedge. XOM stock has the shape of a loosely interpreted head and shoulders pattern.So without clarity on the prices of oil and where OPEC and the United States plan to take prices, and as long as 25% tariffs remain on the January schedule, going long any stock here is an iffy proposition. Let alone going long Exxon Mobil which is holding on by a thread to a ginger floor of $76. This is fraught with danger.At this point I would rather sell puts below $70 to create income and have the opportunity to own the shares at $70 rather than by the stock and hope it rallies in order to make money.

Don’t Buy Google Stock Until a Positive Catalyst Emerges
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ), the parent company of Google, continue to struggle. Despite Alphabet's robust earnings and revenue growth, investors have sold GOOG stock as competition and data privacy concerns weigh on the shares.In the long run, growing profits and falling multiples will revive GOOG. However, unless a new, positive catalyst emerges for GOOG, Alphabet stock will probably continue to decline in the near-term.Bad news and competitive challenges have taken their toll on GOOG stock. The shares have lost more than 18% of their value since late July, leaving them slightly above their 52-week low.The price-earnings ratio of Alphabet stock now stands at 24.9, above the average valuation of the S&P 500 . However, it's well below the average price-earnings ratio of 30.9 that GOOG has enjoyed over the last five years. Moreover, Alphabet had the second-largest market cap behind Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) as recently as a few months ago. Today, the market cap of GOOG also lags behind those of  Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) .The threat of increased competition from Amazon in the digital ad market has hurt GOOG stock. For all of the focus on Google Home, Google Internet Traffic, and GOOG's other, numerous offerings, most of Alphabet's revenue is still generated by digital ads.The threat of regulatory crackdowns by European regulators has also weighed on Alphabet stock. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is forcing tech companies to comply with strict data protection rules. Alphabet recently violated GDPR by withholding details about a leak of user data.Still, investors must put GDPR into perspective. The rule could actually end up helping Google and Alphabet stock, since the high costs of complying with it will prevent many small companies from competing with GOOG.Moreover, the issues facing GOOG don't threaten its viability, and most large companies deal with these types of problems at some point. Consequently, most of the selling of Alphabet stock appears to be driven by unwarranted fears.The company's earnings and revenue are continuing to grow significantly, even though its results have fallen short of analysts' expectations at times. Analysts' consensus estimate calls for the company's revenue growth to come in at 23.1% this year and 19.3% in 2019, roughly in-line with the top-line growth it has generated in recent quarters. Analysts on average predict that the company's profits  will rise 29.6% in 2018 and 12.5% next year.Analysts' consensus estimates call for the company's earnings to continue growing at least 10% for the next five years. No matter how bad the news is, at some point, the price-earnings ratio of GOOG stock will become too low, and investors will begin again to bid Alphabet stock higher.However, rather than wait for that point to come, the company can create its own catalyst by launching a dividend . With more than $106 billion in cash on its balance sheet, GOOG could easily afford to take this step. Moreover, most other companies its size (and many smaller ones) do return cash to their shareholders. Furthermore, such a catalyst would likely increase the market cap of GOOG stock by a larger amount than the payout.GOOG stock definitely needs a catalyst. Admittedly, Alphabet stock will probably move higher in the long run even if the company does not start paying a dividend. However, until GOOG receives some good news, Alphabet stock will likely languish.Alphabet needs to turn its narrative around if it wants to boost GOOG stock soon. GOOG has suffered as competitive threats to its ad business, data privacy concerns, and worries about increased regulation have weighed on the minds of investors. As GOOG stock begins to approach its 52-week low, investors continue to sell the shares despite their lower-than-average valuation.While Amazon and the GDPR issues should only hurt Alphabet stock temporarily, investors need a compelling reason to buy the shares. By introducing a dividend, GOOG could quickly change its outlook and induce more investors to buy Alphabet stock. But even if Alphabet does not take this step, double-digit profit growth and a falling price-earnings ratio will boost GOOG at some point.However, investors will not clamor to buy GOOG stock again until the company announces positive news or its profit growth accelerates. Until at least one of those catalysts emerge, I would avoid GOOG stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

Top Technology Stocks:MSFT: -0.73%AAPL: -0.73%IBM: -0.44%CSCO: -0.36%GOOG: -1.18%Technology stocks were declining in early Friday trading.Stocks moving on news include:(+) Sonos ( SONO  ), which was surging more than 18% after the company's fiscal fourth-quarter loss narrowed substantially from a year ago, exceeding market expectations, on record sales that handily beat the market consensus.(-) NVIDIA ( NVDA  ) was down more than 18% as it reported Q3 non-GAAP earnings of $1.84 per share, up 38% from the $1.33 per share posted a year ago but below the analyst consensus of $1.92 per share on Capital IQ.In other sector news:(+) BlackBerry ( BB  ) was slightly higher after it signed a definitive agreement to acquire artificial intelligence and cybersecurity firm Cylance for $1.4 billion in cash, plus the assumption of unvested employee incentive awards.
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBack in March, I shared my misgivings about Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and suggested it was in trouble. At the time, FB stock was selling at about $176 per share. Readers may have thought that I was insane. By late July, Facebook was selling for as much as $217 per share.Then came the reckoning in FB:  a disappointing earnings report  and negative headlines that have sent FB stock down by one-third, to roughly $143 per share.At that price, you're paying less than 22 times earnings for a stock that had $40 billion in revenue during 2017 and already had $39 billion in revenue through the first three quarters of 2018. Despite heavy investments in cloud data centers and software, Facebook brought $15 billion of that 2018 revenue to the net income line.So, is it time to buy Facebook stock?There is little doubt this year has been an "annus horribilis" for Facebook management.A New York Times article released Nov. 14 added to the pressure, describing a company more focused on its image than its reality, with chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg (the nice one) hiring a conservative marketing firm that linked Facebook protesters to George Soros, and pressuring Democratic leaders to back off investigations.Facebook knew about Russian interference in the 2016 election and covered it up, the expose said. It coddled the peddlers of fake news rather than going after them, and rejected public attacks on its actions from people like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) CEO Tim Cook, even when it knew the underlying facts behind those attacks were true.CEO Zuckerberg's testimony to Congress in the spring, previously called a triumph, has now been revealed to have been stage-managed and false. One elected Democrat is now calling for regulation, saying FB "cannot be trusted to regulate itself." Short-term analysts are saying FB stock will fall further , and they may be right.Employee morale seems to have fallen as hard as Facebook stock .So why should you pick up this hot mess?Start with the fact that Facebook is no longer Facebook.Instagram is Facebook. Whatsapp is Facebook. While their founders have gone, sometimes with harsh words , the services continue to grow, even while traffic at the main service is under pressure.More important is where FB has put its money, on a network of cloud data centers that make it one of the five "Cloud Czars" dominating the leading edge of technology.  It is not hyperbole to suggest that Facebook is now more important to global connectivity than AT&T (NYSE: T ), with 12 data centers and 15 million square feet under management.Facebook has used open source techniques to build its data center footprint, sharing its cost-saving innovations through the Open Compute Project , driving down costs.Maybe Facebook can't depend on giving away content it gets free and advertising against that content for its growth. But Facebook still has enormous cloud computing capacity, in a world hungry for such capacity. It could go into business against Amazon Web Services tomorrow, and even at its present depressed price, Facebook is worth more than twice as much as Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS ) or Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ).The Facebook service is in deep, deep trouble, but investors are underestimating the value of the assets Facebook has built in the process of developing its services.Facebook has yet to see any degradation in traffic at Instagram and Whatsapp, and calls to break up Facebook by separating those services out from the main company  are going nowhere in the current political environment.Let Facebook stock become worth less, but know that it's far from worthless.Dana Blankenhorn  is a financial and technology journalist.

 Back in 2013,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) introduced the iPhone 5s, with a   Touch ID    fingerprint scanner. Touch ID was a big deal, and many smartphone   makers rushed to implement similar functionality -- which proved   a boon for makers of fingerprint-sensing solutions.Then, in November of 2017, Apple began selling its   ultrapremium iPhone X smartphone. The iPhone X did away entirely   with Touch ID (although rumors circulated that Apple had   attempted -- and failed -- to implement an under-the-screen   fingerprint scanning solution) and replaced it with a technology   dubbed Face ID.  Image source: Apple.Face ID uses a depth-sensing front-facing camera -- Apple   calls it a TrueDepth camera -- to implement 3D facial   recognition. (This is why, unlike some other facial-recognition   implementations, Apple's can't be "spoofed" by things like   pictures.)According to respected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo with TF   International Securities (via   MacRumors    ), Apple has a pretty exciting roadmap of technologies for iPhone   3D sensing technologies over the next two years. Let's take a   look.Kuo says that in all of next year's iPhones -- that means the   successors to the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and the lower-cost   iPhone XR -- will incorporate an upgraded TrueDepth camera.   (Apple appears to have reused the TrueDepth camera from the   iPhone X in this year's models, with the speed enhancements   coming from improvements in processing hardware.)"We believe that Apple will raise the output power of the   flood illuminator VCSEL [vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser]   to lower the impacts from invisible lights of [the] environment   in order to improve the Face ID user experience," Kuo wrote.Apparently, this should be good news for investors in the   suppliers of VCSEL components, because the "higher power VCSEL   with higher [average selling price] needs increased requirements   for design and production, increased materials for array design,   and longer testing times," said Kuo.Apple made it clear that it was all-in on Face ID with the   launch of the iPhone X. It has since proliferated the technology   more broadly across both its iPhone product stack (all new   iPhones in 2018 had it, compared to just one of three models in   2017) and its   latest iPad Pro tablets    . It's unsurprising that it's putting its vast might in research   and development -- the company spent $14.2 billion in R&D   during its fiscal 2018, up 23% from a year earlier -- toward   improving the technology.According to Kuo, Apple won't be adding 3D sensing   capabilities to the rear-facing camera systems of the iPhones   that launch in 2019. However, he does think that this capability   will arrive in the iPhones that launch in the subsequent year,   via a so-called "time-of-flight" (ToF) solution.ToF,   MacRumors    explains, "is designed to determine the distance between objects   by measuring the time-of-flight of a light or laser signal   between the camera and the subject at each point in the   image." Kuo explained that adding this capability to the   2020 iPhones "will create the new [augmented reality] experience   and improve photo quality."Moreover, the analyst expects that this ToF implementation   "may adopt the higher-than-1,000nm wavelength VCSEL (vs. current   Face ID's 935-945nm) for better system design and user   experience."Apple seems to be heavily investing in augmented reality, and   the quality of smartphone cameras is important to potential   buyers. Given those factors, the addition of a ToF depth-sensing   solution in the rear-facing cameras of the 2020 iPhones is   exciting.

Is Schwab Fundamental U.S. Broad Market Index ETF (FNDB) a Hot ETF Right Now?
 Designed to provide broad exposure to the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs category of the market, the Schwab Fundamental U.S. Broad Market Index ETF (FNDB) is a smart beta exchange traded fund launched on 08/13/2013. What Are Smart Beta ETFs? For a long time now, the ETF industry has been flooded with products based on market capitalization weighted indexes, which are designed to represent the broader market or a particular market segment.Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.If you're the kind of investor who would rather try and beat the market through good stock selection, then smart beta funds are your best choice; this fund class is known for tracking non-cap weighted strategies.This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.Even though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results. Fund Sponsor & Index The fund is managed by   Charles Schwab  , and has been able to amass over $262.47 M, which makes it one of the larger ETFs in the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs. Before fees and expenses, this particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI US Index.The Russell RAFI US Index measures the performance of the constituent companies by fundamental overall company scores. Cost & Other Expenses Since cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.25% for this ETF, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.FNDB's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 2.11%. Sector Exposure and Top Holdings Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector - about 15.10% of the portfolio. Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.Taking into account individual holdings, Apple Inc Common Stock Usd.00001 (AAPL) accounts for about 3.40% of the fund's total assets, followed by Exxon Mobil Corp Common Stock (XOM) and Chevron Corp Common Stock Usd.75 (CVX).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 18.81% of FNDB's total assets under management. Performance and Risk The ETF return is roughly 1.44% and was up about 7.65% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 11/16/2018), respectively. FNDB has traded between $35.40 and $40.14 during this last 52-week period.The fund has a beta of 0.97 and standard deviation of 11.78% for the trailing three-year period, which makes FNDB a medium risk choice in this particular space. With about 1567 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk. Alternatives Schwab Fundamental U.S. Broad Market Index ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.Invesco High Yield Equity Dividend Achievers ETF (PEY) tracks NASDAQ US Dividend Achievers 50 Index and the iShares Core S&P U.S. Value ETF (IUSV) tracks S&P 900 Value Index. Invesco High Yield Equity Dividend Achievers ETF has $747.76 M in assets, iShares Core S&P U.S. Value ETF has $4.71 B. PEY has an expense ratio of 0.54% and IUSV charges 0.04%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs.

European chipmakers see new growth drivers to weather volatile demand
 By Mathieu Rosemain BARCELONA, Nov 16 (Reuters) - European chipmakers tried to play down market concerns about a potential slowdown in global demand at an investor conference in Barcelona this week, striking an upbeat tone on orders from car and smartphone makers. Recent price falls due to weaker demand for memory chips and a build-up of inventory levels have led some analysts to note the risk of a potential downturn in the global semiconductor industry. Chip gear maker Applied Materials  also gave a disappointing forecast, adding to a drag on semiconductor shares.  Fears of a possible heightening of the trade war between China and the United States, which could hit the sector, has weighed on the shares of STMicroelectronics, Infineon  and Dialog Semiconductor, whose executives attended Morgan Stanley's TMT conference in Barcelona. While industry executives acknowledged that business was under pressure, they also saw new sources of demand in areas such as electric cars and smartphones.  "The visibility is not really great," STMicro's new boss Jean-Marc Chery told the conference, with reference to microcontrollers. "We have seen an inventory correction in the third quarter and we confirm that the fourth quarter will still see this correction," he added. "The only thing I can tell you is that I don't see the economy collapsing." Franco-Italian STMicro supplies 3D sensors for iPhone models. Its shares rose at the start of 2018 on upbeat investor expectations about demand from Apple, but they have now fallen by a third this year. STMicro's shares were down 1.5 percent on Friday as its peers also fell after Nvidia's disappointing forecast.  Still, Chery said STMicro was working on expanding its customer base to Android smartphone makers, which could potentially boost sales for its sensors. The chief executive of Anglo-German rival Dialog,  which supplies power management products found in many Apple products, said the outlook for the chip market, including for the smartphone business and its implications for 3D sensors, was constantly changing. "It is a volatile market, so there will be change almost weekly in terms of the forecast for the rest of the quarter or into the following quarter," Jalal Bagherli said this week. "For us, because of the broader base with this customer, it's less of an issue." The automotive industry has also been a key driver of demand for semiconductors over the last few quarters. Industry executives said that trend would continue as carmakers use more and more electric components in a new generation of electric and semi-autonomous vehicles. "In automotive a lot of the things are pretty long term," Infineon Chief Executive Officer Reinhard Ploss said at the conference. "We have a nice environment in Germany but also elsewhere. A lot of our growth is fuelled by power semiconductors... We have a significant production base and can ramp that," he said. Ploss's optimism contrasts with recent profit warnings from carmakers citing weakening demand and trade frictions. Shares of Infineon ,whose largest business line is automotive, have shed 24 percent this year. Yet STMicro, which counts electric carmaker Tesla  among its biggest customers, would agree - and volume is only part of the equation, according to Chery. "Clearly, now there's a very strong acceleration from carmakers about the fact they need to invest in R&D, in manufacturing, to accelerate their offering in electrical vehicles," the CEO said. "We are convinced that the number of vehicles will remain flat... but components will continue to grow." 
 
Everyone's aware of the seasonal pattern around the holidays. As Thanksgiving and Black Friday near, retailers ramp up their discounts until going full-bore for a roughly monthlong bargain bonanza. But there's an investment thesis, too: Companies whose sales and profits peak around Christmas tend to make good stocks to buy for a short-term bump.It doesn't always work with every seasonal stock, of course. Some companies have bad quarters. And in broad-market corrections and bear markets, almost everything falls - even quality firms that are performing well.But if a normal seasonal pattern holds, several companies - that have exhibited this pattern of rising and falling in previous years - should do quite well. They're not just retail stocks either. Many other types of associated investments get the same type of multi-month boost.Here are seven stocks to buy for a 2018 holiday season pop, though many of them you may want to keep well into the new year.Market value: $59.5 billionFedEx ( FDX , $227.81), the package delivery company formerly called Federal Express, often does well during the Christmas quarter, and 2017 was no exception. Shares gained more than 12% from early October through late December, though it did give back nearly all those gains in the March quarter, falling 8%.The stock looks like a bargain at the moment, trading at just 11.2 times analysts' estimates for next year's profits. The dividend, at 1.1%, doesn't look like what you'd expect out of a value play, but you're getting outstanding payout growth - the 65-cent quarterly dividend has jumped 160% since the beginning of 2016.But there's more than a value proposition; FedEx keeps growing at a decent rate. Last year's revenues of $65 billion should hit $71.3 billion this year, then $75.2 billion next, analysts say. Speaking of the pros, 21 of the 28 analysts following the stock give it buy-equivalent ratings, and none have it as a sell.Nancy Perez, managing director and senior portfolio manager at Boston Private, a Boston-based wealth management company, thinks e-commerce should translate into another healthy season for FedEx. She sees revenue growing by double digits as it continues to gain traction from the strong U.S. economy. And it's one of just a few companies that actually benefit from Amazon.com ( AMZN ) rather than suffer from it - at least for now.Market value: $775.2 billionSpeaking of Amazon.com (AMZN, $1,619.44), the e-commerce giant is up more than 35% year-to-date. That sounds great, but anyone following the stock would know that it was so much better just a few months ago.A broader collapse in tech stocks has hit Amazon particularly hard. AMZN shares are in bear-market territory, having fallen more than 20% off its early September peak. The company didn't help itself in late October, when it announced a robust 29% jump in third-quarter revenues that nonetheless failed to beat Wall Street expectations.Still, Amazon could be in position for a holiday rebound. AMZN shares jumped 22% during the 2017 Christmas quarter, and while shares weakened to start 2018, they took off again after the company reported terrific results in early February.Boston Private's Perez says Amazon should do well again in the 2018 holiday season, citing a National Retail Federation forecast that overall Christmas-season sales will rise 5% from last year.Edward Jones consumer analyst Brian Yarbrough expects Amazon to continue gaining market share against brick-and-mortar retailers this Christmas season, as convenience becomes ever more important and consumers continue to evade crowds. He did, however, have it as merely a hold based on its value in early October, as the correction in tech stocks began.Market value: $921.6 billionApple ( AAPL , $191.41) is another tech stock that has fallen into bear-market territory, if only even briefly, with a quick 20% drop between its Oct. 3 high and its Nov. 14 low. While it made headlines as the first U.S. company to reach $1 trillion in market capitalization earlier this year, it has since ceded that mark, though it remains the most valuable company by market value.Apple has struggled mightily since its most recent earnings report, in which it not only reported flat iPhone and Mac unit sales, but said it would no longer report unit sales - what many analysts took as a sign that Apple expects gadget sales to be underwhelming going forward.Boston Private's Perez points out Apple still has an attractive valuation compared to other tech stocks. AAPL trades at a forward P/E of merely 13 despite analyst predictions for double-digit profit growth next year and a dividend that, while modest at 1.5%, is rapidly growing . Moreover, there's still a bull case - namely, Perez believes, Apple's efforts to push more users to spend on its Services division offerings such as iCloud and Apple Music.Last year, Apple rose by about 10% during the holiday season. Considering how low expectations appear to be for Apple's unit sales, perhaps a similar-sized rebound could be in the cards for the rest of the year.Market value: $18.3 billionBest Buy ( BBY , $67.78) has stunned a lot of market experts over the past few years by delivering strong returns in the face of Amazon's business advances. That included a 20% jump during the holiday-season months.BBY has cooled off a bit this year, however, pacing for slight losses with about six weeks left in the year. Rumors of poor Christmas sales dragged the stock in February, then shares fell further once the bad news was confirmed in March.But John Burke - CEO of Burke Financial Strategies in Iselin, New Jersey - still likes Best Buy. "Best Buy beat expectations with their August earnings report, with strong sales in electronics, mobile phones and entertainment," he writes, growing e-commerce by 10% and in-store revenues by 5%."And if analysts' projections hold, Best Buy should remain one of the best turnaround stories in the market . The pros still believe the retailer will post modest revenue gains this year and next (versus many other brick-and-mortar operators that continue to see sales slide), and they expect 15% profit growth this year followed by a 7% climb in 2019.As for a holiday boost this year? Best Buy should benefit from a broader uptick in consumer spending, but it's also positioning itself to gain customers from deceased Toys R Us by bolstering its toy selection for the 2018 holiday season.Market value: $9.9 billionGap ( GPS , $26.22) stock often can be a big Christmas tease. The stock rises as reports grow of a great holiday season ... then falls back when more modest numbers are released. Last year, for instance, GPS rose 18% during the fourth quarter, but fell back by about 6% during the March quarter.Gap admittedly isn't as strong a long-term play as the rest of the stocks on this list. The Gap brand specifically is struggling. Last quarter, the company reported its seventh consecutive quarter of growing same-store sales, yet the Gap brand specifically reported a 5% decline in comps. Analysts worry that heavy discounts are dissuading customers from ever paying full price, and crimping margins.There are a few reasons to buy. GPS shares have been knocked into deep-value territory of less than 10 times future earnings estimates, and patient shareholders are being paid to wait via a 3.5% dividend.Admittedly, even if the Gap has a boffo fourth quarter, it will take more than one strong report to convince investors that there's a real long-term buy-and-play thesis here. But even whispers of a good Q4 could be enough to propel battered-and-bruised GPS shares considerably higher.Put another way: Gap may be a good short-term play for more speculative investors.Market value: $29.6 billionSouthwest Airlines ( LUV , $53.23) is the most domestic focused of major U.S. airlines, and that - as well as an emphasis on top-tier customer service - has helped the stock nearly triple over the past five years.It hasn't been smooth sailing the whole way. In fact, LUV had more than tripled as of just a month ago, but the stock turned tail fast in late October despite a very strong quarterly earnings report. Southwest delivered record third-quarter earnings per share of $1.08, operating revenues grew 5.1% year-over-year and revenue per available seat mile (an important airline operating metric) improved by 1.2% YoY. All these results came in the face of higher fuel costs.Investors still responded by selling in droves, and shares remain off nearly 20% for the year-to-date.A strong Christmas season could turn the tide. LUV shares jumped nearly 12% during the holiday quarterly of 2017, and airline ticket prices are expected to jump sharply for the 2018 holiday season. Meanwhile, investors who decide to stick around for longer than just a few months should be rewarded with a quickly growing payout that has more than doubled since 2016. In fact, LUV represents one of the fastest-growing dividends  in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.B ) portfolio.Market value: $285.3 billionWalmart ( WMT , $99.54) has lost a little bit of steam of late amid Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' push to force the company to raise its minimum wage to $15 across the board. But the company remains a retailing juggernaut whose projected $515.7 billion in current-fiscal-year sales is more than double the $232.3 billion that analysts expect Amazon.com to earn this year.It also spread plenty of holiday cheer to investors in 2017, rocketing 26% during the holiday quarter alone.Edward Jones' Yarbrough expects Walmart to excel this Christmas, too. He likes their efforts in e-commerce, which has been led by the 2016 purchase of Jet.com, but also include other smaller e-commerce pickups over the past couple years, as well as the addition of grocery pickups, and the 2018 addition of a 77% stake in Flipkart - the Indian answer to Amazon.com.Burke, of Burke Financial Strategies, notes that Walmart's margins are better than Amazon, and sees Amazon's purchase of Whole Food Market last year as an admission that Walmart's "combination of bricks and e-commerce" is the right strategy.Perez sees Walmart setting up well for Christmas, too, with 57% of online shoppers expecting to visit its website over the holidays, and 70% of women age 40-54 planning to shop at the store."Walmart's fulfillment investment has been effective," she adds.
Qualcomm's Chances of Winning Back the iPhone Don't Look Good
 Back in 2016, wireless giant   Qualcomm    (NASDAQ: QCOM) lost its status as the sole source of the cellular   modems inside   Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhones, when chip giant   Intel    (NASDAQ: INTC)  became a second modem source for the iPhone   7-series of devices.Qualcomm remained an iPhone modem supplier for the subsequent   generation of iPhones. However, Qualcomm was designed out of this   year's crop of iPhones, made possible by Intel's added support   for the CDMA wireless standard -- a standard that some carriers   still rely on -- to its latest cellular modem, known as the XMM   7560.  Image source: Intel.Back in February, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, at the time   reporting that Intel would be the sole supplier of modems into   the 2018 iPhones, indicated -- by way of    9to5Mac      -- that Qualcomm might eventually be readded to the iPhone   modem supply chain.Here's   9to5Mac    's summary of Kuo's comments:He is now claiming that Qualcomm will be excluded from 2018     iPhones altogether. However, KGI does not rule out Qualcomm     returning to the supply chain, perhaps as concessions in the     patent lawsuit settlement.KGI says there's also a risk that Intel may not be ready for     5G networking as quickly as Qualcomm, which may also force     Apple's hand.Given recent developments, I think the odds that Qualcomm will   win back iPhone modem orders anytime soon don't look good. Here's   why.Qualcomm is the market leader in terms of cellular modems, but   Intel's execution seems to be improving. According to   PC Magazine    's testing, "the iPhone XS -- powered by Intel's XMM 7560 modem   -- is a huge step up from the iPhone X when it comes to LTE   download speeds, according to exclusive new data from Cellular   Insights and Ookla Speedtest."The site did admit that it "doesn't quite match the Qualcomm   X20 modem used in the   Samsung    (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Galaxy Note 9." However, the performance   difference seems a lot smaller than it was with prior generations   of Intel modems, signaling that Intel has improved the   competitiveness of its modem technology with the XMM 7560.As far as the 5G risk that Kuo highlighted back in February,   it's worth noting that Intel recently announced that its   XMM 8160 5G modem    , the modem that   Fast Company reports will power Apple's 2020 iPhones    , is on track to ship in the second half of 2019 and will pop up   in devices during the first half of 2020. Fast Company    also reported that Intel's XMM 8060 5G chip -- a chip that Intel   indicates is intended for use as a "development   platform," not as a part that'll find its way into shipping   devices -- is leading to "heat dissipation issues."With that in mind,   Fast Company    stated that "Apple's current issues with Intel are not serious   enough to cause Apple to reopen conversations with Qualcomm about   supplying 5G modems."Now, supplying a company like Apple is a marathon, not a   sprint, so Intel can't just get the XMM 8160 out and declare   victory for all time. The company needs to keep cranking out   modems that meet Apple's requirements while not missing a beat in   terms of schedule.However, given that Intel's modem execution seems to be on an   upward trajectory, and considering the   bitter legal dispute    that's currently ongoing between Apple and Qualcomm, the chances   don't look good that Qualcomm will win back Apple's cellular   modem business anytime soon.

The Dow traded in a range of more than 560 points on both sides of breakeven, but ultimately closed higher. J.P. Morgan Chase ( JPM  ) stock shot higher after Warren Buffett's Berkshire took a stake, and blue-chip  Cisco Systems (   CSCO    )   rallied to the top of the Dow after an impressive earnings report. A rebound in Apple ( AAPL  ) stock also lifted the tech sector today, and helped overshadow a post-earnings drop from  Walmart (   WMT    )   . In addition, trade optimism helped the major market indexes reverse early losses, amid reports that China and the U.S. are making progress ahead of an expected meeting at the G-20 summit later this month.

 Investors weren't too impressed with   Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL) fiscal   fourth-quarter earnings release    earlier this month, largely because the company's guidance fell   short of what the Street was modeling for. The added uncertainty   around changes to financial reporting probably didn't help much   either, as shareholders prepare to lose insight into iPhone,   iPad, and Mac unit volumes. Prominent suppliers have also been   warning of potentially weak demand for the new iPhones, including   Austria's AMS, which reduced its fourth-quarter outlook just   this morning.That's all contributed to shares shedding 15% of their value   since the report. Here's why it could be a buying opportunity in   disguise.  Image source: Apple.For starters, Apple investors have a documented history of   overreacting to supply chain rumors (   myself included, at times    ), and that's partially what's going on currently. Despite   Apple's best efforts to shift focus away from iPhone units,   investors still   stubbornly remain fixated    on how many iPhones the company sells in any given quarter, which   CFO Luca Maestri argues is "   not necessarily representative of the underlying   strength of our business    ."The services business continues to grow steadily, and it   enjoys high-margin recurring revenue. The segment is receiving an   artificial boost due to Apple adopting new revenue recognition   standards, and under the new reclassification generated   $39.7 billion in revenue in fiscal 2018 (compared to $37.2   billion as previously reported). It's worth noting that the new   classification was not considered when Apple first set its goal   to double services revenue by 2020 relative to fiscal 2016.Morgan Stanley this morning reiterated its overweight   rating on shares alongside a $253 price target, similarly   arguing that the market is still "narrowly focused on units,   despite the increasing value of Apple Services." Analyst Katy   Huberty says shareholders should appreciate the services business   more, as the global smartphone market has been maturing for   years. Peaking iPhone unit volumes were   always inevitable    .Additionally, Apple was able to ramp production faster this   year, after facing iPhone X supply constraints last time around.   That explains why it is reportedly reducing orders from suppliers   already. There's also little reason to overthink supplier   warnings when the tech titan has already issued its own forecast.   Keep in mind that Apple has beat its own December quarter   forecast for the past two years. The company has a reputation of   issuing conservative guidance.QuarterRevenue GuidanceActual RevenueQ4 2016$76 billion to $78 billion$78.4 billionQ4 2017$84 billion to $87 billion$88.3 billion Data source: SEC filings.Beyond services, massive buybacks will continue to drive   earnings growth, in Huberty's view. Apple has significantly   accelerated repurchase activity in the wake of tax reform last   year. The company still has   $122.6 billion to return    to shareholders before it reaches its net cash neutral goal.   Meanwhile, Apple trades at a cheap 17 times earnings -- a   discount compared to the   S&P 500    's 22 times earnings multiple.

3 Dividend Stocks That Are Perfect for Retirement
 Dividends are your best friend in retirement, but simply   adding high-yield stocks to your retirement portfolio won't help.   Stability and security of income are priorities in your golden   years, which is why it's important to go for stocks that pay   dividends consistently and, preferably, even grow them   regularly.Established companies in their respective industries with   strong earnings and cash-flow visibility are some contenders you   could consider. Examples include   Aqua America    (NYSE: WTR) ,   3M Company    (NYSE: MMM) , and   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) . Here's why these three Motley Fool contributors   believe these three    dividend   stocks    are great to own in retirement.  Maxx Chatsko    (Aqua America):    Wall Street didn't know what to do with the recent announcement   that Aqua America, a water utility based in Philadelphia, had   agreed to acquire Peoples, a natural-gas utility based in   Pittsburgh. The nearly $4.3 billion deal marks a significant   expansion for the nearly $6 billion water utility, which would   lean on natural gas for 30% of its regulated rate base after the   deal settles. So, Mr. Market sent the   dividend stock down 10%    -- pushing the dividend yield to 2.6% -- in an unusual stock   movement for the predictable, regulated business.  Top-notch dividend stocks can hugely help you enjoy your     retirement. Image source: Getty Images.That's because of the added uncertainty surrounding the   financing of the mammoth acquisition, which could really hurt   shareholders down the road if Peoples doesn't deliver a high   enough return. The risk can't be discounted completely, but   long-term investors will find a lot to like in Aqua America's   big, bold bet on the city of Pittsburgh, which will become the   utility's natural gas headquarters.The city sits in a prime location to quarterback the growing   energy dominance of Appalachia, which would be the world's   third-largest natural gas producer if it were a stand-alone   country today. And it's expected to double its output by 2022.   The region has downright pathetic renewable energy potential, so   natural gas will be the dominant heating and electricity source   for decades to come -- for both residential customers (what Wall   Street is focused on) and industrial customers (an overlooked   growth opportunity for Peoples).Additionally, Peoples has a significant opportunity to   modernize its nearly 14,000 miles of natural-gas utility   infrastructure in western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and   Kentucky, which bodes well for earning higher rates from   customers in the near future. That's why Aqua America expects the   natural-gas utility business to grow up to 10% per year, compared   to just 7% for the water utility business. Throw in Pittsburgh's   aging and somewhat embarrassing water infrastructure (complete   with lead leaching, wastewater overflows into the Three Rivers,   and a heavily indebted wastewater treatment company that's ruined   the budget for the entire state in recent years) and Aqua America   could find opportunities outside of natural gas in the Steel City   -- and more than make up the $4.3 billion acquisition cost over   time.  Neha Chamaria  (3M):    Industrials conglomerate 3M has all the qualities you'd want in a   dividend stock, from its track record to dividend growth   potential.A   Dividend King    is a company that has increased its dividend every year for at   least 50 years. Making it to the list is no cakewalk, but 2018   marked 3M's 60th straight year of dividend increases. Credit goes   to disciplined capital allocation and management efficiency in   handling a hugely diversified portfolio that comprises top-notch   global brands like Post-it and Scotch and more than 60,000   products sold across the globe.In 3M's latest five-year plan for 2019-2023, management   confirmed its commitment to dividends. In the five-year period,   3M expects to grow its earnings per share by 8% to 11%, generate   as much in free cash flow as net income, and increase dividends   in line with earnings while maintaining a payout ratio of around   30%.In short, I expect a high single-digit percentage increase in   dividends every year for at least the next five years. Even if   business conditions were to worsen and 3M's performance falls   short of its own estimates, it's unlikely to break its dividend   streak thanks to a conservative payout ratio that leaves enough   room for dividend increases even in a challenging year. 3M's   dividend yield of 2.7% might not be tempting, but a steadily   rising dividend should prove more rewarding for those planning   for or in retirement than an eye-popping, unsafe yield.  Chris Neiger    (Apple):    Apple may not be the first stock that comes to mind when you   think of dividend investments, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't   be a strong contender for your portfolio. Let me explain why.Apple pays a modest dividend yield of about 1.4% right now,   but investors should know that the company has a low payout ratio   of about 24%, meaning Apple has lots of room to continue   increasing its dividend.Additionally, Apple has proved that it can consistently grow   its business and find new areas to boost sales despite naysayers   repeatedly saying that the company lacks innovation. Take, for   example, Apple's   recent report on sales from its services   business    . In fiscal 2018, Apple brought in about $37.2 billion from its   services (the App Store, AppleCare, Apple Music, Apple Pay,   etc.), representing an increase of 24% from the year before.   That's not only fantastic growth, but it means Apple services now   account for 14% of Apple's top line. The iPhone is still the   company's real breadwinner, but Apple has proved with its   services segment that it can find new ways to make money from its   customers.If all of that weren't enough, investors should know that   Apple is still experiencing   strong revenue and earnings growth    , especially for a company of its size. In the fourth quarter,   Apple's revenue jumped 20% to $62.9 billion, and its earnings per   share spiked 41% to $2.91. All of this means investors who are   searching for a solid dividend stock that can continue increasing   its yield and bringing in fantastic sales and earnings should   find everything they're looking for in Apple.

 On Oct. 26,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) began selling the iPhone XR, the most affordable   of the three iPhones that the company unveiled on Sept. 12.It wasn't long before teardown specialists at iFixit   dismantled an iPhone XR, revealing to the world what the insides   of the device look like, and identifying many of the key   component suppliers for the product.  Image source: Apple.Here are three companies whose technologies were found inside:   Intel    (NASDAQ: INTC) ,   Micron    (NASDAQ: MU) , and   Broadcom    (NASDAQ: AVGO) .It's been known for a while that Intel would be the sole   supplier of cellular modems into Apple's latest line of   smartphones, so it's unsurprising that iFixit's teardown unveiled   that Intel is, indeed, inside of the device.iFixit reported finding three Intel-supplied chips in the   device: an Intel 9955 chip (iFixit believes that this is the   baseband processor, and I agree), an Intel 5762 chip which is the   radio frequency (RF) transceiver chip, and an Intel 5829   power-management chip.TechInsights'   teardown    of the iPhone XS Max revealed the same PMB9955 baseband processor   and PMB5762 RF transceiver, but it apparently had an Intel   PMB6829 power-management chip. It's not entirely clear if the   modem power-management chips in the iPhone XR and iPhone XS Max   are different or if iFixit simply made a typo, but I'm going to   assume that it's a typo.What investors should take away is that even though the iPhone   XR and the higher end iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max differ in rated   (and, according to    PC Magazine    's testing    , delivered) cellular performance, Intel has the same chip   content across all three iPhones.Micron sells both mobile DRAM and mobile NAND flash, and   iFixit's iPhone XR sample was shown to include mobile DRAM -- 3   GB of LPDDR4X, to be precise -- from Micron.The iPhone XR ships with only 3 GB of DRAM, while the iPhone   XS and iPhone XS Max pack 4 GB, so Apple's DRAM suppliers --   Micron included -- would probably rather see Apple sell more of   its pricier iPhones than its cheaper ones.Now, DRAM is a commodity product, and Apple generally sources   its mobile DRAM from multiple vendors. For example, TechInsights   found Micron DRAM across several initial samples of the iPhone XS   and iPhone XS Max, but eventually found a model with DRAM   supplied by   Samsung    , too.Although Broadcom   admitted to losing some content in the iPhone   XR    , the company is still a key component supplier in the device.   iFixit identified a wireless power receiver chip, as well as a   Wi-Fi/Bluetooth module that's "similar to what's found in the   [iPhone] XS," meaning that it contains a Broadcom Wi-Fi/Bluetooth   combination system-on-a-chip (SoC).Indeed, Broadcom has long been the sole supplier of the   Wi-Fi/Bluetooth in the iPhone, and if Broadcom had lost the spot   or even share in the iPhone XR, it'd have shown in the company's   financial performance and guidance.It's worth noting that TechInsights reported finding a   Broadcom   3D Touch    controller in the iPhone XS -- something that's presumably not in   the iPhone XR, because that model doesn't support 3D Touch.Unlike Intel, which has the same chip content across all of   Apple's new iPhones, Broadcom should clearly benefit when iPhone   buyers choose the higher-end iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max over the   iPhone XR.  10 stocks we like better than Intel       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,     Motley Fool Stock Advisor      , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the      10 best stocks       for investors to buy right now... and Intel wasn't one of them!

The TTWO Stock Dip Is a Perfect Gift for Contrarian Investors
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf an enigma exists in the markets today, then it's video-game maker Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ: TTWO ). Thanks to its two primary brands, Rockstar Games and 2K, TTWO stock soared in recent years on the back of compelling game titles. But despite positive news surrounding the organization, TTWO has hit extremely-volatile waters.Many bulls are left scratching their heads. The most notable catalyst for Take-Two stock is the underlying company's latest release, Red Dead Redemption 2 . In just eight days, the Wild West-themed action-adventure game sold more copies than the original version over its eight-year lifespan.In actual numbers, we're talking about 17 million units over that short period. That translates to $725 million in revenue. TTWO calls it "the single-biggest opening weekend in the history of entertainment."We've all heard hyperbole from CEOs pumping their companies' equity value. However, Take-Two's opening weekend was huge. According to Boxofficemojo.com , the biggest-opening weekend in cinema history is Disney 's (NYSE: DIS ) "Avengers: Infinity War." That film raked in $640.5 million  worldwide in its opening weekend. It went on to make $2 billion overall.But I have to point out that the "single-biggest opening weekend" claim is a bit pedantic. The biggest three day opening actually goes to Grand Theft Auto 5 , which raked in an astounding $1 billion in just 3 days. However, it was released on a Tuesday.Still Red Dead Redemption 2 having jumped to nearly three-quarters of a billion in just over a week is huge, and GTA 5 is also a Take-Two title. For me, that's more than enough reason to consider TTWO stock.The problem? Wall Street doesn't share this enthusiasm. Take-Two stock is down nearly 18% just in November. What's even more bizarre is that management delivered a great beat for its fiscal second-quarter 2019 earnings report.The common explanation is that the company produced disappointing guidance. Still, is that enough reason to trash TTWO stock?It's common advice that you shouldn't fight the markets. They can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. That said, I completely disagree with the bears. The severe correction in Take-Two stock has gone too far ahead of itself.Let's quickly recap the Q2 figures. The Street pegged consensus earnings per share at 93 cents, while the actuals came in at $1.05. More impressively, TTWO rang up $583 million in revenue , against a forecast of $550 million. That's a meaty 6% positive surprise, which helped lift TTWO stock in extended-hours trading.The disconnect started to occur when management revealed its guidance for Q3 , which anticipates adjusted earnings of $2.55 on $1.43 billion in net sales, or what they term " net bookings ." Analysts called for $2.59 per share on sales of $1.35 billion. On the next day, TTWO stock dropped more than 5%.But does a 1.5% miss on earnings projections justify this severe fallout? Those who panicked out would say that Take-Two stock deserved its volatility because management should have demonstrated more confidence. After all, "Red Dead Redemption 2" is a groundbreaking title.I can somewhat understand that argument. However, this logic misses the bigger picture. Investors should consider not just this release's impressive unit sales but rather, why sales were so outstanding.In an industry of mindless, transient titles, Take-Two understands that most financially-successful video games feature strong and engaging storylines. It's not enough merely to throw in pretty graphics and a popular brand name.Just ask Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA ). EA essentially hurried the launch of "Star Wars: Battlefront" to coincide with the Force Awakens film release. It did not feature a single-player campaign mode, and gamers fiercely criticized it .When most game makers eschew single-player modes for dynamic, online gameplay, Take-Two stock might seem an anachronistic investment. But clearly, the leadership team knows what they're doing: Red Dead 2 proved the viability of "old school" games with compelling storylines.And the only entertainment release that has performed better is Take-Two's own Grand Theft Auto V.What those who are panicking out of TTWO stock are not realizing is that they have engaging storylines on lockdown. In an awfully-fickle sector, creating brand loyalty is a gargantuan task. But Take-Two makes it look so easy.That's why I didn't blink an eye when some analysts have called for Take-Two stock to hit $160 . Like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), TTWO produces addictive products. Something like that doesn't stay on discount forever.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post The TTWO Stock Dip Is a Perfect Gift for Contrarian Investors appeared first on InvestorPlace .
Apple partners with Oscar-winning movie studio A24 for feature films
 Nov 15 (Reuters) - Apple Inc  has inked a multi-year deal with A24, the studio behind Oscar-winning projects "Moonlight" and "Amy", a source familiar with the plans told Reuters, as the iPhone maker pushes deeper into original content and movies. Apple, which had allocated an initial $1 billion for programming, earlier inked deals with Hollywood celebrities including Oprah Winfrey and ordered two seasons of a series starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston to bring in more content for its users. Other projects Apple had announced include a remake of Steven Spielberg's 1980s science fiction anthology series "Amazing Stories," based on Isaac Asimov's influential "Foundation" science fiction novels, and a drama from "La La Land" movie director Damian Chazelle.  The deal comes at a time when top online streaming service providers including Netflix Inc, Amazon.com Inc'sPrime Video and Time Warner Inc'sHBO are spending billions to create original content. 
 
Nearly Two-Thirds Of The Entire U.S. Stock Market Just Went Through A Bear Market
October was a rough month for the market. As of 10/29/2018:Well, that sure wasn't fun! The S&P 500 fell 6.9% last month, making it the third worst month since the bull market began nearly 10 years ago. The decline was sharp and swift with some U.S. companies losing more than $10B in market capitalization. The table below highlights some of the carnage that took place with a few S&P 500 members that fell 40%-60% from their one-year highs.      Source: Bloomberg, Financial Sense Wealth Management. Note: For Illustration Purposes Only. This is not a solicitation to buy or sell securities.When we broaden our view to look at small-cap and mid-cap companies, the declines are even more severe. The Russell 3000 adequately represents 98% of the entire U.S. market capitalization. When we look at the details of how extensive the decline was last month, the numbers are astounding. Of the 11 market sectors, only the defensive utility and real estate sectors, on average, did not witness a bear market. That was a tough feat to accomplish when the average U.S. stock fell 27.5% from its highs. Sixty-four percent of U.S. stocks went through a bear market, meaning they fell by at least 20%, and more than 11% of companies lost half their market value.      Source: Bloomberg, Financial Sense Wealth Management. Note: The index tracks the performance of the 3,000 largest US-trades stocks. You cannot invest directly into an index.To give you a sense of what a difficult year it has been to be a stock picker, look at the table below showing various major index year-to-date (YTD) returns as of Nov. 2 compared to the index's median member's YTD return. The greatest variation was seen in the Nasdaq, which was up 6.18% YTD (largely due to Apple's ( AAPL  ) outsized influence) compared to its average member which was down nearly 7% for roughly a 13% performance differential.

You cannot invest directly into an index.In a clear change from the prior sell-offs during this bull market, we haven't seen a flight to safety where investors run to bonds (bond returns are typically positive during market routes). Instead, at the market lows on Oct. 29, only one out of 17 U.S. fixed income bond categories were up for the year. Even bonds have suffered with rising interest rates.      Source: Bloomberg, Financial Sense Wealth Management. Note: Past performance is no guarantee of future results.The following table from JPMorgan shows this year's losses in fixed income were not isolated to U.S. bond markets - most bond markets across the globe were down as well.      Source: JP Morgan, "Guide to the Markets" (4Q 2018). Note: Past performance is no guarantee of future results.In October, the U.S. stock market could no longer ignore the carnage occurring all over the world in virtually every asset class except for U.S. stocks. We believe the record amount of stock buybacks was a large reason for this. U.S. companies are expected to retire roughly $1 trillion in market capitalization this year, with a significant portion of this coming from repatriated cash brought back to U.S. shores from the 2018 tax cuts. Interestingly, with all the fear and anxiety regarding trade wars, the impact of rising global tariffs pales in comparison to the amount of repatriated cash as shown in the following table.      Source: Fidelity Sector & ETF Outlook (Q4 2018)Before they announce earnings, companies are prohibited from buying back their stock until 48 hours later. According to estimates from Goldman Sachs, 86% of the S&P 500 companies were restricted from buying their stock by Oct. 5  . Not surprisingly the S&P 500 put in a meaningful top just two days prior. However, companies will be exiting their blackout period en masse  and the market could be gearing up for some welcome support.As CNBC reported two weeks ago companies buy up their shares, just in time for the market  : It's going to be a record year for buybacks. DataTrek   estimates that in the last 12 months, the companies in the   S&P 500 have purchased $646 billion of their stock, 29% more   than the previous 12 months. Most estimates believe total   announced buybacks will hit $1 trillion this year.Here's the key. A big chunk of that money has not been spent   yet. One firm estimates there could be as much as $350 billion in   "dry powder" from unspent buybacks available.So the money is there, and it's pretty clear that the drop in   stock prices will be very enticing for company financial   chiefs.Deutsche Bank's Parag Thatte, in a recent note to clients,   noted that "As the blackout period rolls off for more companies,   especially those with large buyback programs, the pace of   buybacks will ramp up sharply."Goldman Sachs agrees. It notes that November has historically   been the most active month of the year for buybacks.We believe the record buyback programs announced should lift stocks higher into the end of the year and allow the market to recoup a significant portion of its October decline. It's likely market returns will improve as we close out the year and, based on our expectations for a difficult 2019, we will be using the market rally to raise cash and position accounts defensively for 2019.We see three major developments that will likely weigh on financial markets heading into next year. The first is a slowing global economy. Last month we were treated to China's third quarter GDP which came in at 6.5% annual growth, lower than the expected 6.6% rate. It was the weakest since the global financial crisis of 2009 where first quarter GDP growth rate fell to 6.4%. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates China's GDP growth for 2019 will be 6.2%, which would mark the slowest pace of growth for the Chinese economy in a quarter century. Given China is the world's marginal growth engine, their continued slowdown will be felt throughout the globe and will weigh on global growth estimates next year. The IMF cut its estimates for world GDP growth from 3.9% to 3.7% for this year and next. Given that roughly 40% of S&P 500 company revenues comes from abroad, the growth slowdown will have an impact on foreign sales for 2019.The second headwind markets will have to contend with is reduced liquidity in global financial markets. Next year we are likely to witness the largest annual contraction in the big four central bank balance sheets since the great global financial crisis a decade ago with the U.S. Fed seen as the greatest culprit. The U.S. Fed began to shrink its balance sheet this year and will continue to do so heading into 2019, while the European Central Bank is slated to end its quantitative easing program this year. The Bank of Japan is expected to continue expanding its balance sheet next year, however, they already have been undergoing a stealth tapering of their monthly purchases as the annual growth rate of their balance sheet has decelerated from peak annual growth of 47% in 2014 to 6.5% currently. As shown in the figure below, balance sheet growth for the big four central banks will turn negative in first quarter 2019.      Source: JP Morgan, "Guide to the Markets" (4Q 2018)In addition to reducing global USD liquidity by shrinking its balance sheet, the Fed also is expected to continue its tightening policy, raising interest rates next year as the U.S. labor market continues tightening. Recent non-farm payrolls data showed job gains of 250,000 for October with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7%. One of the most notable developments in the job's report was the pickup in annual wage inflation to 3.1%. It's the highest growth in wage inflation since April 2009 which is likely to put continued pressure on the Fed to push forward with its rate-raising program. An aggressive Fed compared to global central banks will likely put upward pressure on the USD, further restraining global USD liquidity which is severely punishing emerging markets this year.Stocks will have to contend with a third development in 2019: Rising margin pressures from various fronts. As mentioned above, annual wage inflation for October hit 3.1%, the highest reading in nine years. With the cost of labor equal to the largest cost of goods sold for many companies, rising wage inflation does not bode well for profit margins. In addition to rising labor costs, we also are seeing a general rise in material costs. The Producer Price Index (PPI) core inflation gauge (removing food and energy) rose to an annual inflation rate of 2.7% in September, the highest reading seen in six years. Core consumer inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index ( CPI  ), rests near the upper annual inflation range of the last decade. An ongoing trade war with China is impacting manufacturing as we saw in the October's Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) Purchasing Managers Index (PMI). Comments from some of the businesses surveyed are provided below. October 2018 Manufacturing ISM Report on Business  : "Tariffs are causing inflation: increased costs of imports,   increased cost of freight and increased domestic costs from   suppliers who import." (Chemical Products)"Protein prices continue under pressure from heavy U.S.   supplies and export concerns related to trade tariffs. Higher   costs related to trade tariffs are starting to be passed on to   the cost of goods sold." (Food, Beverage & Tobacco   Products)"We continue to run at full capacity. I continue to see   pricing pressures and longer lead times in most commodities."   (Primary Metals)"Mounting pressure due to pending tariffs. Bracing for delays   in material from China - a rush of orders trying to race tariff   implementation is flooding shipping and customs." (Miscellaneous   Manufacturing)"Steel tariffs continue to negatively affect our cost, even   though we utilize U.S. sources for steel. Oil prices put   meaningful upward pressure on cost. Continued tightness with   truck drivers is expected." (Petroleum & Coal Products)Another expected source of margin pressure in 2019 is a continued march higher in interest rates, which increases financing costs for corporate America. The U.S. Fed is expected to raise interest rates several times next year which impacts short-term interest rates. It's the U.S. Treasury that's likely to influence long-term interest rates next year much as it did this year as it issues increasing amounts of debt to cover Trump's tax stimulus. Treasury Expects to Issue Over $1 Trillion in Debt in 2018  :The Treasury said Monday it expects net marketable debt to total $425 billion in the fourth quarter, which would bring total debt issuance in 2018 to $1.338 trillion, compared with $546 billion in 2017. That would be the highest annual debt issuance since $1.586 trillion in 2010, when the U.S. economy was still crawling out of a recession…Rising federal budget deficits are boosting the Treasury's borrowing and could restrain economic growth as the cost of credit also rises…The deficit is headed toward $1 trillion in the current fiscal year, the White House and Congressional Budget Office said. The Office of Management and Budget projects the government is likely to run trillion-dollar deficits for the next four years.In addition to trillion-dollar deficits, we're likely to start seeing trillion-dollar interest payments. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) projects U.S. government interest payments to exceed three-quarters of a trillion dollars next year. They're expected to reach an all-time high as rising interest rates on record amounts of U.S. government debt will increase this country's financing costs going forward.      Source: Bloomberg, Financial Sense Wealth ManagementThe developments highlighted above: Slowing global growth, reduced USD global liquidity, and rising margin pressures are likely to produce a choppy ride for financial markets heading into 2019. Therefore our plan will be to use market strength between now and the end of the year to raise cash and cut losses in losing positions. We believe that the completion of 2018 stock buybacks are likely to push stocks higher into year-end, providing us an opportunity to position defensively heading into next year.Markets are likely to remain choppy until one of two catalysts emerge: Either global growth stabilizes as China launches fiscal and monetary stimulus to turn around their slowing economy or the U.S. Fed hints they're near the end of their rate raising cycle. Already, the Fed's rise in interest rates appears to be putting in a peak for two major areas of the economy: Housing and auto production. Any further rate increases in the coming months will continue pressuring these cyclical areas. While auto production and housing already are rolling over, we've yet to see the economy roll over due to Trump's tax stimulus. However, as the tax stimulus begins to fade and as the Fed's tightening cycle continues, we should see growth begin to cool going into next year which may give the Fed some cover to halt their rate raising program.On the global growth front, China's manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for October came in at 50.2, the lowest reading since July 2016, and shows no sign of stabilizing. China's slowdown is weighing on global growth where the global manufacturing PMI came in at 52.1 for October-the lowest reading since November 2016. China has only marginally eased financial conditions this year but not to the degree of their easing cycle back in 2016 which spurred a two-year global growth upturn, and they haven't undertaken significant fiscal stimulus yet. It appears for Chinese government authorities and the U.S. Fed there needs to be more economic and financial pain before they alter their course. This is why our plan going forward is to have a defensive stance until circumstances change.See also When This Apple Falls, The World Trembles  on seekingalpha.com

At this point, Apple stock is trading at about the same spot it was at in August and analysts are starting to cool their short-term enthusiasm. And recently, two of Apple's suppliers - companies where Apple is their chief customer - have cut guidance, stating that demand from one of their top customers has been reduced.These are the kinds of sideways stories that get analysts and traders excited since Apple isn't talking but people are inferring that business for the major consumer electronics retailer isn't rebounding yet.However, some of this news comes as no surprise. There has been talk for quite a while now that Apple's phone sales aren't going to continue to expand at the rates they once did. And Apple has already begun to transition its revenue engine into other divisions, like its music and entertainment division.A couple of weeks ago, there was even a story that Apple is beginning to restructure its phones and computer brands, so that they were more focused on the high-end market. It wasn't about selling more phones, but selling more expensive phones with better margins.This would also take Apple on a new trajectory when it comes to innovation. It may signal that with everyone in the industry able to compete on a relatively similar playing field when it comes to features, it's time to start to curate its audience.And there may be something to be said for doing this in the long run. But right now, the company with the first $1 trillion market cap is having to adjust expectations and open new revenue channels.Too often, these challenges get blown out of proportion as well. Last year, there was all sorts of hand-wringing about the launch of the iPhone X.The challenge this year is that the U.S.-China trade war is helping push China toward a recession, which isn't good for sales in China.First of all, the Chinese government can use the trade war to stoke national pride and encourage people to buy Chinese made phones, which have become very good. Second, with less spending power, Chinese consumers are less likely to upgrade as regularly as they once did.The other challenge AAPL has to contend with now is the fact that AAPL stock is so widely held. It's one of the top holdings by mutual fund managers and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRK.A , NYSE: BRK.B ) is the third-largest shareholder of AAPL shares.While fund managers have to buy and sell stocks in their portfolios to keep in line with their benchmarks and indices, Buffett is a long-term investor that rarely trades on his positions.AAPL rates a B in my Portfolio Grader right now. And it's still up 11.6% year-to-date. Also, the fourth quarter could very well deliver a nice surprise.Productive talks between Washington and Beijing and a strong finish in 2018 could get Apple stock quickly back on track and make today's prices look like a bargain.Louis Navellier  is a renowned growth investor.

 On Oct. 30,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) unveiled a   long-overdue overhaul    of its entry-level MacBook Air product line. The new system   includes a redesigned case (with more color options), a brand-new   screen with thinner bezels, a Force Touch trackpad, Touch ID   fingerprint reader support, Thunderbolt 3 connectivity, and new   Intel    (NASDAQ: INTC) 8th Gen Core processors, which also go by the code   name "   Amber Lake    ."Now, something that's unusual about the new laptops is that   Apple is only offering them in a single processor configuration   -- Core i5-8210Y. (The "Y" suffix denotes that this chip is from   Intel's ultra-low-power line of Core processors.)  Image source: Apple.Typically, computer makers -- Apple included -- offer multiple   processor options as a quick and easy way to encourage customers   interested in more performance to shell out more money. Both   system vendors and Intel have a vested interest in getting   customers to buy computers with higher-end chips since to the   extent that buyers do that, those parties enjoy higher revenue   and profits.That's why it was surprising to see that Apple didn't release   a version of the new MacBook Air with a higher-end Core i7.It would seem that one might be in the works after all. Let's   take a closer look.On Slash Leaks (via MacRumors), a user posted a screenshot   showing a Geekbench 4 performance test result of a device running   Mac OS 10.14.1 with what appears to be an Apple-designed   motherboard (MacRumors says the device's "logic board has the   same part number as the new MacBook Air") and a Core i7-8510Y   chip.Intel's processor database doesn't list a Core i7-8510Y -- the   only Core i7 part is the 8500Y. Per the Geekbench 4 result, the   8510Y has a base frequency of 1.8 GHz, which is higher than the   1.5 GHz base frequency of the 8500Y. It's also higher than the   8500Y's "TDP up" base frequency of 1.6 GHz.Other leaks also indicate that the 8510Y has higher-end UHD   Graphics 617 instead of the 8500Y's UHD Graphics 615.Put simply, it looks like the Core i7-8510Y is an unreleased   member of Intel's low-power Amber Lake family of processors --   one that's quite possibly custom-developed for Apple -- that's   faster than what Intel has announced so far.MacRumors concludes that "there is possibly a new MacBook Air   with a Core i7 in the wild that Apple decided not to ship or may   ship at a later date."There are a number of potential explanations for what's going   on here. Here's MacRumors' take: "Why the MacBook   Air with a Core i7 wasn't released is anyone's guess --   maybe it ran too hot, or Apple elected to keep the dual-core Core   i7 a   MacBook Pro     option, or something else. "I'm going with "something else."Indeed, I believe that the Core i7-8510Y, due to its   relatively aggressive specifications, is meaningfully more   difficult for Intel to produce in quantity than any of the other   members of the Amber Lake family that have been announced to   date.What might be happening here, then, is that Apple -- not   wanting to delay this long-awaited MacBook Air refresh any   further -- simply released the Core i5 variant of the device with   the chips that it can buy from Intel in high quantities. Then,   once Intel is in a position to supply Apple with the higher-end   Core i7-8510Y chips in high volumes, Apple could add that   processor as an option for its customers.This would make sense from Apple's perspective because it   might not want to take a bunch of orders for configurations of   the new MacBook Air that it couldn't ship in a reasonable amount   of time. Instead, it might make sense for Apple to make customers   think that the Core i5 model is as good as it gets so that   potential buyers don't hold off on their purchases until a   potential Core i7 model makes it out.

 Technology giant Apple Inc. AAPL  logged in its seventh consecutive weekly loss, something the stock hasn't done in the past six years  . The broad tech sector turmoil as well as negative news flow has taken a toll on Apple shares lately. In fact, the stock is down nearly 20% from its recent peak, indicating that it has entered into the bear market. With this, Apple's value has dropped to about $886 billion from the October highs of $1.13 trillion (read: Apple Woes Trigger Tech Sector Rout: ETFs Under Threat  ).  Further, on its earnings call, Apple said that the company will no longer break out individual sales numbers for iPhone, iPad and Mac starting next quarter. The three main product lines will be wrapped into one reported revenue figure. This has spread negative sentiments about the company's growth prospects and that its largest segment by revenue may be set for weaker growth.    However, per a Reuters  ' article, several prominent investors put fresh money into Apple during the third quarter anticipating that the iPhone maker's stock would keep rising as strong growth overshadowed rising trade tensions between the United States and China. Mutual fund giant Fidelity added 7 million shares, bringing its total holdings to 110.9 million shares, regulatory filings and data from research firm Symmetric.io show. Janus Henderson Group added 3.3 million shares for a total of 20.8 million shares and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co boosted its holding to 42.7 million shares after adding 1.3 million (read: Apple Beats, Guides Lower: ETFs in Focus  ).    Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management made a big bet by raising his exposure by 938% to 884,321 shares, while Chase Coleman's Tiger Global Management put on a new position to own over 1 million shares.   Solid Estimates Trend    Apple has seen rising earnings estimate revisions from $13.24 to $13.35 per share for fiscal year 2019 over the past 30 days. This represents substantial year-over-year growth of 12.09%. Revenues are expected to grow 4.95%.       The stock is currently trading at a PEG ratio of 1.38, much lower than the industry average of 1.75, suggesting that it is a better value stock in the industry. The lower the PEG ratio, the better the value as investors would be paying less for each unit of earnings growth. Additionally, Apple is cheap with P/E ratio of 14.40 compared with 15.77 for the industry.    Further, Apple currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has a VGM Score of A. It belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry ( top 24%  ) at the time of writing, suggesting strong upside for the stock over the coming days (see: all the Technology ETFs here  ).      ETFs to Tap    Given the strong fundamentals, investors seeking to tap the beaten-down tech titan could consider the following ETFs. These funds have Apple as their top firm with a double-digit allocation.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI don't like it when stocks trade at extreme valuation discounts because too many investors believe this is a catalyst for higher prices. It's not, and all we need to do is look at Micron Technologies (NASDAQ: MU ) to realize it. MU stock has traded a low valuation for the last few years and yet, it was never a catalyst that pushed the stock higher.Of course, Micron stock has gone higher, but that's only as the DRAM cycle held up better than many investors and analysts were expecting. It's also because earnings and revenue continued higher.Too many investors look at MU's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and use that to justify a position. But the valuation - particularly the P/E ratio - is just one consideration, not the only consideration to choosing a position. For instance, when MU stock was at $60 a share, it traded at ~5 times current year earnings expectations. Dirt cheap right?Well now that shares are down over 35% at $38, Micron stock trades at 3.8 times this year's earnings expectations. The valuation didn't help much, did it?I don't want readers to think the valuation is bad. Of course a P/E in this neighborhood should get investors' attention, particularly when Micron is earning what it is.So how is business? After earning more almost $12 per share last year in non-GAAP EPS, analysts expect Micron to earn $10.25 this year and $9.54 next year. On the revenue front, forecasts call for a 60-basis-point-increase this year and a 20-basis-point-decrease next year. So essentially, expectations are calling for flat growth over the next two years and an erosion of the bottom line.That erosion is being caused by a few things, one of which is tariffs. Management said those have recently gone into effect and will eat into profits. NAND margins are under pressure too.The better news is DRAM, which accounts for about 70% of revenue. Last quarter, DRAM average selling prices (ASPs) were flat year-over-year. In other words, it didn't see the pricing power deflation that some analysts were expecting. We also got a hint from the  Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO ) conference call on Nov. 14, following a very good quarter .CFO Kelly Kramer said DRAM prices continued to climb while supplies remained tight in 2017 and 2018. "So our strategy was securing supply. We bought inventory ahead. We did everything we could to try to minimize the impact. We had big purchase commitments and we are s till seeing year-over-year price increases in this quarter."Kramer said these headwinds should ease sometime in fiscal Q2 (the current quarter) and become a tailwind in Q3 and Q4. That would be bad for Micron stock in my mind. But she also just told us that Cisco has been increasing its orders to build an inventory. She's not saying that prices are falling and Cisco's reaping the reward. Just that, like an airline company knowing fuel costs will climb, they opted to buy when they could at better prices.Maybe that shows slack in the supply market. Maybe it suggests MU has one more good quarter left. But to me, DRAM hasn't completely fallen apart yet and that bodes well for MU stock.Above is a five-year weekly look at Micron stock. MU is resting just above this $35 to $38 band of support. It's a scary time in the stock market, where even studs like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) find themselves in bear market territory . Perhaps they are better buys than Micron at these levels.But given the valuation and steady outlook on DRAM, I'm not sure it should be ignored. All I know is that this $43 billion company has about $4.5 billion in total debt, almost $7 billion in cash and had a net income of more than $14 billion in 2018. If it can clear $10 billion in each of the next two years - it should - it will prove to be too cheap at these levels.If support holds up, investors have a reasonable risk/reward on their hands. They can take a small position initially and add to that position once MU stock hurdles its 10-week moving average. This mark has been resistance and is at roughly the same level as the 50-day moving average, for those who look at the daily chart.Below support and they cut-and-run.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell . As of this writing, he was long NVDA and AAPL.The post Is Micron Stock Going to Double or Get Cut in Half? appeared first on InvestorPlace .

The 9 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next Decade
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips[ Editor's Note: This article was originally published in December 2017 and the author's opinion may have changed. Each stock pick has been updated to reflect changes in the market. ]A few years ago, InvestorPlace contributor Dan Burrows highlighted the 10 best-performing S&P 500 stocks of the past decade. The most important lesson one finds studying these high-flying best stocks is that patience wins out over all other attributes of a successful investor.A classic example of how true this is involves the Fidelity Magellan Fund (MUTF: FMAGX ), the large mutual fund made famous by portfolio manager Peter Lynch. Lynch ran the fund for 13 years from 1977 until 1990, growing it from $20 million to $14 billion before stepping aside.Fidelity studied the returns of Fidelity Magellan unitholders over those 13 years to see how they compared to the legendary portfolio manager. While Lynch managed to achieve a 29% annual return over this period , the average investor lost money.Patience would have served those investors well, as the ups and downs of the stock market shook them out of their positions - and in doing so, deprived them of millions of dollars in profits. A $10,000 investment in 1977 held until 1990 was worth $273,947 by the end of that 13-year period.I'm not Peter Lynch, but I can say with some confidence that the examples to follow are the nine best stocks to buy for the next decade.Let's take a look.Not only is Amazon  (NASDAQ: AMZN ) CEO and founder Jeff Bezos a great chief executive, but Amazon has its hands in so many pies - including a very profitable cloud business that generates almost $1 billion in annual operating income - that it's hard to fathom just how big Amazon could be a decade from now.While Amazon's AWS cloud business is a big deal, Amazon Prime is the service that delivers the goods when it comes to building the foundation for AMZN stock. More than 100 million people subscribe to Amazon Prime at $99 per year.It's not the $9.9 billion in annual subscription revenue that matters, but the amount each of those subscribers spends on other Amazon products. Statistics show that 76% of Amazon Prime members spend more than they did before paying the annual $99 fee.That's what you call "pulling power," and it's a big reason why AMZN stock will be a winner for the long haul.You can say what you want about the iPhone maker's best days being behind it, but I have a feeling Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will continue to create products people want to buy for years to come.What these products are, I couldn't tell you.What I do know is that Apple will continue to generate a huge amount of free cash flow to reward shareholders for their patience and loyalty.That loyalty recently translated into AAPL stock becoming the world's first publically traded company to hit a trillion-dollar valuation .AAPL currently converts 71.7% of its EBITDA into free cash flow, which is pretty darn close to the 77.7% conversion rate of Amazon - a company known for doing a good job converting cash.While Apple is no longer reporting iPhone numbers, its Services revenue continues to look more and more promising.Warren Buffett is 88 years old. Eventually, he's going to step out of the game. The argument is that his departure will create a panic that will send Berkshire Hathaway  (NYSE: BRK.A , NYSE: BRK.B ) stock spiraling downward.Personally, I don't subscribe to that theory.Businesses - whether it be a huge holding company like Buffett's or something much less grandiose - are valued by calculating the present value of its future cash flows. Berkshire Hathaway's are significant.Another way is to value a business is to look at the sum of all its parts.Berkshire Hathaway owns hundreds of businesses; each of these firms, if sold at auction, would be worth more than the current stock price would seem to reflect. If Buffett moved on and the company was broken up in a prudent manner over an extended period, Berkshire Hathaway investors would benefit greatly from such a process.The best part of Berkshire Hathaway? You get a quasi-mutual fund with a diversified group of holdings and no management fees.That's the best kind of buy-and-hold investment.The retail industry is in a free fall at the moment, yet Illinois-based Ulta Beauty  (NASDAQ: ULTA ) is busy growing its network of stores - which currently number 974 - by 100 per year. It expects to build out its brick-and-mortar footprint to 1,700 stores over the next decade.Ulta's business model provides a shopping experience that is unique in a beauty market where no one firm controls a big chunk of market share, not even Sephora . In fact, Ulta controls just 4% of the $127 billion U.S. beauty market despite having almost $5 billion in annual revenue.With consumer confidence growing, Ulta stands a good chance over the next decade of bumping this number significantly higher. ULTA shares might be expensive at 30 times earnings, but that's the price you pay to own the best.Ulta Beauty helps women with their beauty needs; Sherwin-Williams Co (NYSE: SHW ) does the same for houses and businesses around the world.What's the one thing real estate professionals suggest you should do when selling your home? Give it a fresh coat of paint. It's the most cost-effective improvement you can make to bring in better offers.Sherwin-Williams originally tried to buy Mexican paint company Comex in 2014, but it was beaten out by PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE: PPG ). More than two years later, it's in the homestretch of closing its $11.3 billion acquisition of The Valspar Corp (NYSE: VAL ), which will significantly improve its position in the coatings business outside North America.Over the past decade, SHW has achieved a return of more than 600%, significantly greater than the S&P 500's 82% climb in that same period.If any stock can repeat this kind of performance over the next decade, Sherwin-Williams has to be at the top of the list.Earlier this year, the management of Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ: KHC ) put quite the scare into the 169,000 Unilever plc (ADR) (NYSE: UL ) employees with a potential $143 billion offer to buy the company. Fortunately (for employees), Unilever's management told the Brazilians - 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway control KHC - to take a hike.Kraft Heinz is going to make another acquisition, most likely this year. And when it does, the first thing the Brazilians are going to do is trim the fat. (Read this article about Tim Hortons to understand their cost-cutting ruthlessness.) That's going to mean the loss of a lot of jobs.While that's terrible for the people on the receiving end of the pink slips, it's been proven by 3G Capital time and again to significantly increase the bottom line.

  U.S. stock markets closed sharply lower on Wednesday following investor concerns that banks will face tighter regulations once Democrats take control of the House of Representatives.

All three major stock indexes closed in the red.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 25,080.50, shedding 0.8% or 205.99 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) also declined 0.8% to close at 2,701.58. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,136.39, dropping 0.9%. A total of 8.96 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 8.53 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1.54-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners had an edge over advancers by 1.93-to-1 ratio. The CBOE VIX increased 5.3% to close at 21.08. How Did the Benchmarks Perform? The Dow ended in negative territory for the fourth straight day, its longest losing streak since Aug 13. Notably, 23 components of the 30-stock blue-chip index closed in the red while 6 finished in the green and the remaining one was unchanged. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite closed resumed its downward journey after a brief gap of yesterday when the tech-heavy index closed flat.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 also closed in the red for fifth consecutive days.

Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF), Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and Utility Select Sector SPDR (XLU) are major losers dropping 1.5%, 1.2% and 1%, respectively. Notably, ten out of total 11 sectors of the benchmark index closed in the red while one finished in the green. Banking Stocks Plunge On Nov 14, CNBC reported that Democrat Representative Maxine Waters stated that Trump administration policy of gradual deregulation of banking industry will come to an end once the new House of Representatives starts proceedings from January 2019. Maxine Waters is likely to become the Chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee in the new Congress.Maxine Waters conveyed her concerns about the Federal Reserve's efforts to reduce capital and liquidity requirements for banks. According to her, deregulation of banks is in fact raising the possibility of another financial crisis for the United States.

You can see    the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here   . Apple's Nosedive Continues On Nov 14, shares of Apple Inc. AAPL  declined 2.8% marking its fifth straight day of losses. Notably, the tech-behemoth had entered bear market territory yesterday for a brief period. Although it finally recovered, the stock is still hovering around bear market territory. At present, shares of Apple are down 19.9% from its recent peak recorded in Oct 3. A drop of 20% or more from the Oct 3 price will put the stock in bear market territory.Various component suppliers of Apple have reduced their sale guidance due to weak demand from the company. Several analysts have also reduced future sales prospects of iPhones. All these negatives intensified fears of a global economic slowdown, which dominated market sentiments from the beginning of this week. This was exacerbated by the crude oil price plunge, and these tailwinds together dragged down the whole technology sector. Conflicting Statements on Trade Front No concrete decision has come from the White House about possible trade negotiations with United States' largest trading partner China. Notably, President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are slated to meet later this month at a G-20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina.On Nov 14, Peter Navarro, Trump's trade adviser, stated "globalist billionaires" are putting pressure on the White House to find arrive at an amicable trade solution with China. However, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow did not subscribe to this statement. The U.S. government has warned that it will levy tariffs worth $267 billion on China if the upcoming meeting between the two Presidents fails to arrive at any solution. Economic Data The Department of Labor reported that Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the month of October rose 0.3%, in line with the consensus estimate.

Natural Gas and Energy: 2 ETFs to Watch on Outsized Volume
In the last trading session, the U.S. stocks saw rocky trading as Apple AAPL slipped into bear territory and oil price extended its worst rout. Notably, Dow Jones Industrial Average logged its longest losing streak in three months. Among the top ETFs, investors saw SPY lost 0.7%, DIA shed 0.8% and QQQ move lower by 0.8% on the day.
 Two more specialized ETFs are worth noting as both saw trading volume that was far outside of normal. In fact, both these funds experienced volume levels that were more than double their average for the most recent trading session. This could make these ETFs the ones to watch out for in the days ahead to see if this trend of extra-interest continues:UNG : Volume 13.32 Times Average
 This natural gas ETF was in the spotlight yesterday as more than 43.1 million shares moved hands compared with an average of 3.9 million shares a day. We also saw some price movement as UNG surged 18.9% in the last session.
 The movement can largely be blamed on a surge natural gas price. Cold weather increases fuel demand for heating purpose, thereby leading to higher natural gas consumption. UNG has soared 50.9% in a month's time.PXE : Volume 6.67 Times Average
 This energy ETF was under the microscope yesterday as 227,000 shares moved hands. This compares with an average trading day of roughly 37,000 shares and came as PXE was flat in the trading session.
 The big move was largely the result of falling crude prices that can have a big impact on stocks like what we find in this ETF portfolio. PXE has lost 15.5% over the past month and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a High risk outlook.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will be hit hard by weakening international currencies. This is particularly true when it comes to China's impact on Apple stock. While the U.S. and China prepare for tough negotiations in their trade talks, there is a significant risk that China's currency will further weaken, which could hit AAPL in turn.Bloomberg reported that the White House is concerned about possible currency manipulation during its trade talks. A weaker Yuan increases the price of products bought by consumers in their local currency. This has led to weaker demand for AAPL products in China in the current cycle. At the same time, Apple can face further regulatory bottlenecks in the country, which would hurt its overall results.The USD-Yuan exchange rate went from 6.95 in early January 2017 to a low point of 6.26 by March 2018. This is an inverse ratio, which means that a lower number indicates strength in Chinese currency vis-à-vis the dollar. On the other hand, a rapid rise in this number, as seen in the last few months, means that the Chinese currency is weakening against USD.Apple converts its Chinese revenue from Yuan to USD when it reports its earnings. A stronger Yuan or weaker dollar increases the dollar value of the revenue made by AAPL in China. Similarly, a weaker Yuan or stronger dollar reduces the dollar value of the revenue made by AAPL in China.Currently, the USD-Yuan exchange rate is close to 7. If tariffs and rhetoric further escalate, we could see the exchange rate move to 7.2 or 7.3. The U.S. dollar is also increasing in strength against the Euro. The dollar showed a steep decline against the Euro throughout all of 2017. This has helped Apple in showing better year-over-year comparison data in 2017 and early 2018 because the reported dollar value has been higher. And by extension, this has also helped AAPL stock.Europe contributed $62.4 billion of revenue out of a total of $266 billion - 24% - in the last fiscal year for Apple. Greater China contributed $51.9 billion or 19.5% to total revenue. Together, these two regions have a higher contribution to Apple's total revenue base than the Americas .One of the reasons for the strengthening of dollar is the recent trade tariffs pushed by the Trump administration. This has caused a flight to safety toward the U.S. dollar. Another reason is the expected interest rate trajectory of the Federal Reserve.In the past few months, almost all the major currencies in the world have weakened against Dollar. The Euro has seen a decline of 8.6%, the Yuan has declined by 9.6% and the Indian Rupee has declined by 10.2%. A weaker currency forces Apple to increase the price of the product in the domestic market, which could hit Apple stock hard in the months ahead. And we can see this pain in all international markets.The recent base model of the iPhone XS Max is selling at RMB 9599 in China. Last year, the iPhone X was sold at RMB 8388. Hence, there has been a 15% increase in the price of the iPhone in terms of the Yuan. The actual increase in terms of the Dollar has been only 10% from $999 to $1,099. Emerging markets like India have also seen a significant decline in their local currency, which has reduced the demand for AAPL products.The currency swing in the Yuan is part of a larger trade issue. If push comes to shove, we could see other actions by the Chinese administration on U.S. companies. Apple is the biggest foreign brand in China and it has already faced some regulatory hurdles in China when there were issues between the U.S. and Chinese government. In 2014, Apple's launch of iPhone 6 was delayed in China, which was believed to be due to ongoing problems between the two governments.If the trade issue is not resolved in the next couple of weeks, AAPL stock could again face a big problem. Apple is already facing substantial competition from Chinese OEM manufacturers like Huawei , Oppo and Xiaomi , which are increasingly targeting the mid-tier pricing of $400 to $600 in China. This leads to lower demand for Apple's entry-level smartphones. It also hurts the resale value of higher-end phones by Apple.The better economic climate in the U.S., flight to safety in the Dollar and Fed rate increases will keep bolstering the strength of the Dollar. AAPL stock has received significant tailwinds in 2017 and early 2018 due to a weaker dollar. However, now that the Dollar is getting stronger, we could see much more muted results from Apple. Apple has not shown any sizable increase in unit shipments in the current iPhone cycle. Most of the revenue growth was propped up by ASP growth.The ASP is already sky-high, which limits the potential of future growth in this metric without hurting unit shipments. Hence, a much stronger dollar at this moment will end up being a big headwind for the company and Apple stock. If the trade rhetoric continues to increase and the Dollar continues to strengthen, we could see a big bearish sentiment toward Apple stock in the short term.As of this writing, Rohit Chhatwal did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post Apple Stock Will Get Blasted Hard If U.S.-China Trade Dispute Continues appeared first on InvestorPlace .

  Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL)    iPhone XR    -- a device that incorporates many of the elements of the   company's premium iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max in a lower-cost   package -- might not be doing well as some had hoped it   would.Ming-Chi Kuo, a respected analyst with TF International   Securities who had previously been optimistic about the iPhone   XR, recently came out and slashed his estimate for how many Apple   will ship between the fourth quarter of 2018 through the third   quarter of 2019 from 100 million units to just 70 million   units.  Phil Schiller. Image source: Apple.He gave three reasons for his estimate cut. Let's take a   closer look at them.The first reason that Kuo cited was "negative impacts on   consumer confidence from the   trade war    , especially in the Chinese market."The Chinese market is an important one for Apple. Indeed,   during its fiscal 2018, the company reported generating $51.94   billion in revenue from the "Greater China" region, making up   almost 19.6% of its total sales for the year.During the company's Nov. 1 earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook   said that in China, "iPhone, in particular, was very strong --   very strong double-digit growth there."The next issue that Kuo cites is "expectations from more uses   for more affordable XR or the dual-camera and narrower bezel   design to be provided at the current price level."Put another way, Kuo seems to be arguing that the iPhone XR   as-is doesn't provide a good enough value for the money because   it has slightly thicker bezels than the ones found on the iPhone   XS and iPhone XS Max (as well as many Android devices) and has   only a single-lens rear-facing camera.Apple's pricier iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max devices   incorporate dual-lens rear-facing cameras, something that's   undoubtedly due to those devices' higher selling prices (creating   additional room in the bill of materials for a pricier two-lens   system), as well as Apple's desire to segment the product lines   (the two-lens system on the higher-end models is a selling   point).If Apple decides that it'd be best off bringing a two-lens   rear-facing camera to next year's iPhone XR, then there are a   couple of ways it can do so while still affording the higher-end   successors to the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max some points of   differentiation.If the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max successors stick with   dual-lens cameras, then Apple could still give the next iPhone XR   a dual-lens camera, but reduce its performance in some way. Apple   did this with the iPhone X and iPhone 8 Plus last year when it   endowed the latter with an inferior telephoto camera.Alternatively, Apple could give the successors to the iPhone   XS and iPhone XS Max triple-lens rear-facing cameras (this has   been rumored in the past), which would allow the company to give   the next iPhone XR a dual-lens camera while still having an   easily marketable point of camera differentiation in the   higher-end models.Finally, Kuo cited "competition from Huawei's Mate 20 series"   as a factor that led him to reduce iPhone XR shipment estimates.   Huawei has been growing its smartphone shipments at a rapid   clip.In the second quarter of 2018, for example, IDC said that   Huawei had shipped more smartphones than Apple did, making it the   world's second-largest smartphone vendor by market share. IDC's   data for the third quarter also showed Huawei in second place by   unit shipments, ahead of Apple.Huawei, however, sells smartphones at a much wider range of   price points than Apple does, so the unit share picture doesn't   tell anywhere close to the whole story from a financial   perspective.Nevertheless, if Kuo is right, Huawei's efforts in the higher   end of the smartphone market are negatively impacting demand for   the iPhone XR.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's not difficult to find a reason to steer clear of Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU ) right now. Revenue growth is slowing, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) is working on a competing product and Roku stock itself is struggling to pick itself up after taking a post-earnings tumble. The picture is anything but encouraging.Yet, for intellectually honest investors who've played this game for a while, nothing about the 45% selloff from the stock's early October high is truly surprising, nor is it intimidating. If anything, it's inviting to trading veterans who don't mind buying when there's blood on the streets. Roku is a young company, and Roku stock is still a relatively fresh listing. It can take a while for the dust to settle, and for expectations to be adjusted.To that end, while most retail investors have been dumping their shares, analysts - the pros that get paid to look past the cloud of dust - have remained conspicuously bullish on Roku.There's a good reason.If you think all stocks reflect the underlying value the company they represent at any given time, think again. Most generally do, but many don't.Roku stock has, since being listed in September of last year, spent the better part of its life in the "don't" category. Investors fell in love with the pace of its revenue growth and the fact that it was even able to beat the venerable Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) in terms of streaming-TV box market share, and for some reason the market assumed the company's strong double-digit sales growth could be maintained indefinitely.It couldn't.Last quarter, platform revenue - licensing and ad sales - was up 74% year-over-year to $100 million , and overall revenue was up 39% . Problem: Both figures were notably weaker than the second quarter's progress, when platform sales grew 96% and company-wide revenue was up 57% year-over-year.Worse, analysts had been modeling platform revenue of $103.2 million.Even worse than that, the company doesn't expect sales growth to accelerate anytime soon. Roku is looking for revenue of between $255 million and $265 million for the quarter currently underway. That's, on average, a little better than the consensus outlook of $258.8 million. Still, a top line at the midpoint of that range would only be about 38% more than year-ago levels, marking yet-another slowdown.The question most analysts are tacitly asking with their responses to the results and outlook is, what did you expect?It's not a terribly difficult idea to understand. The more revenue a company produces, the more difficult it becomes to maintain relative growth rates because the comparison/baseline figure is forever getting larger. Most companies go through it as some point.That's where Roku is now, but it's not a reason to steer clear.Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter explains "We continue to believe in Roku's growth potential and that the company will, in fact, reach profitability as early as next year. Therefore, we think the recent pullback in Roku's share price presents a compelling opportunity to build a position."Pachter's price target on Roku stock remained at $65.Pachter isn't the only fan though. William Blair's Ralph Schackar is also still on board with Roku, not lamenting the fact that growth has slowed relative to prior quarters, but celebrating that growth has remained robust despite tougher comps. Schackar cheers the combination of the facts that strong with streaming hours viewed accelerated to the tune of 63%, the number of active accounts was up 43% and that the average revenue per user was up 37% year-over-year.KeyBanc's Evan Wingren agreed that the most important metrics to watch were ad revenue and the number of active accounts, noting that both showed improvement last quarter. Wingren reiterated his $81 Roku stock price target and "overweight" rating.Conversely, there weren't any real concerns analysts wanted to pound the table about.None of this is to suggest analysts can't be wrong. There was a whole slew of analysts who were convinced GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO ) was a game-changer. It has been nothing but a massive disappointment.Roku isn't trying to create a whole new product category by itself though. The streaming TV market's path has been rather well mapped, even if the trail's not been blazed. There's no doubt that streaming TV is the future, and there's little doubt that Roku will be the company to continue leading the trailblazing.The recent weakness is simply the effect of euphoric investors coming down off of their high now that the company has significant year-ago numbers to compare to. Shareholders have been a bit spooked, but take note of the fact that the level-headed analyst community doesn't see a problem. The consensus target is still around $68, more than 60% above the current price of Roku stock.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

 By Sruthi Shankar Nov 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks struggled on Thursday as an attempt by technology companies to rebound from this week's sharp losses was outweighed by a batch of weak results and Brexit-related concerns. Department store operators J.C. Penney Co Inc  and Dillard's Inc  reported disappointing third-quarter results, casting a gloom on the retail sector, despite strong results from the world's largest retailer Walmart Inc. The results pulled down the broader group, sending the S&P 500 retailing index  1.6 percent lower, despite economic data that showed U.S. retail sales rebounded sharply in October. Walmart was down 2 percent.  Political events in Europe also scared investors after a series of resignations in British Prime Minister Theresa May's government threw into doubt her long-awaited Brexit deal and reports of anti-euro comments from an Italian official.  "There's news around Brexit and traders are reassessing the notion that we could have a no-deal Brexit," said Matt Forester, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon's Lockwood Advisors in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. "Overall earnings highlight concerns that we've seen the best earnings growth in this cycle and we're concerned about the future." U.S. stocks got off to a shaky start this month after a sharp selloff in October as investors weigh the prospects of rising interest rates, slowing global economy and heightening trade tensions.

Humans want to know "why." Understanding the reasons for events has driven science, theology, and... the financial media. When your conclusion about the reason is wrong, it can be very costly. Here is an excellent example.Now, let's try an alternative viewpoint.And that is how a $70 million revenue miss turned into a trillion-dollar loss - at least on paper. An insightful investor, who emphasizes knowing his/her companies and their value, should not make too much out of big moves and overly-simplified narratives.For more examples, check out  Trading, Fast and Slow   .See also Modeling Bitcoin's Growth With The UTXO Set  on seekingalpha.com

 By Sruthi Shankar Nov 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks struggled on Thursday as an attempt by technology companies to rebound from this week's sharp losses was outweighed by a batch of weak results and Brexit-related concerns.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe S&P 500's 0.75% loss booked on Wednesday could have been worse, though not a lot worse. At one point it was down as much as 1.3%. Still, it was the fourth straight loss for the index, three of which were sizable. The market's true strength is once again being called into question.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) supplied most of the dead weight, falling 2.8% after Guggenheim lowered its rating on the stock while simultaneously lowering its earnings expectations of the company. PG&E (NYSE: PCG ) was the biggest loser for the session, however, with the utility stock sliding 21.8% in response to the possibility that it may be at least partially responsible for the spread of California's wildfires .There were some winners. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ), for instance, raced 6.1% higher for no reason in particular … other than the fact that it's a name traders love to love. But, with declining stocks outpacing advancers by about two to one, there just weren't enough names like AMD to get the broad market anywhere near positive territory.As Thursday's trading action kicks off, it's the stock charts of Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ), TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX ) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) that merit the closest looks. Here's the deal.A week and a half ago Adobe was one of the three stock charts put into focus, as shares were being forced into a retest of a key moving average line by the stock's falling 20-day moving average line.The bulls took one last shot at turning things around, but hitting a new but just-as-tough wall, they yielded pretty quickly to the bigger bearish tide. As of Wednesday, ADBE has broken below the first critical support level. One more bad day could break the last remaining floor.
 Click to Enlarge • The big support level in question is the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts. Friday's last trade leaves it as far below the 200-day line as it's been since 2016.• A minor floor has taken shape around $231, marked with a red dashed line. If that floor snaps too, there's not much left that will keep the stock propped up.• Should the bears push Adobe over the edge, the next-best landing spot is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement line near $208.Shares of off-price retailer TJX Companies certainly had a good run earlier this year, but as of August the sheer weight of those gains proved problematic. The stock became range-bound, between $52.40 and $56.30.Just a few days ago it looked like the stock was going to stage a breakout past the upper edge of that boundary. But, in just three trading days, TJX has moved dangerously close to breaking below that range instead. One more misstep could start a selling avalanche.
 Click to Enlarge  • The clues don't point in favor of the bulls. The selling volume has been on the rise for the past three days, and there's a bullish gap from August that's begging to be filled back in.• TJX Companies hasn't yet broken below that floor though, nor has it broken below the 100-day moving average line, in gray, that has since stepped up as a potential support level.• Though the gap is relatively small and only requires a move to $50.90 to fill it in, if that selloff gets started it may not be easily stopped. The next most likely landing point is around $47.Finally, Morgan Stanley shares have been in a well-defined downtrend since April. And, though technically oversold and arguably ripe for a reversal, the sheer bearish momentum has made it tough for the stock to even attempt a reversal. Wednesday's action underscores that reality, setting the stage for even lower lows.
 Click to Enlarge  • The falling trading range is plotted on both stock charts, by white dashed lines. Lending a helping hand is the 50-day moving average line, in purple, which was tested yesterday only to send MS shares sharply lower.• A close look at the volume trend, as evidenced by the falling accumulation-distribution line and the Chaikin line's value under zero, clarifies that there are still plenty of sellers coming out of the woodwork.• The downtrend has a pretty clear path to $40, give or take, where a major floor was made in early 2017. That value marks a 32% retracement from the stock's peak, which should be enough to fully clear off the weak hands.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

 Small chipmaker   Cirrus Logic    (NASDAQ: CRUS) has been talking about its plans to diversify its   business beyond sales of audio chips into premium   smartphones.For example, in its most recent investor presentation, the   company indicated that its serviceable available market (SAM) is   set to expand dramatically in 2021 from 2017 levels thanks to   growing opportunities in   smart accessories    , haptic drivers, and smart-home applications, as well as a new   $750 million opportunity in biometric voice chips.  Image source: Apple.All of that is well and good, but -- at least today -- the   company is still heavily dependent on sales of audio chips to   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) (mainly in support of the iPhone).Let's take a closer look at that Apple dependence.In its most recent quarterly filing (the company reported   results on Nov. 1), Cirrus Logic said that sales to Apple made up   "approximately 82 percent of the Company's total net sales for   each of the second quarters of fiscal years 2019 and 2018,   respectively."In other words, Cirrus' dependence on Apple was unchanged year   over year as a percentage of sales.Over the first six months of fiscal 2019, sales to Apple made   up 79% of the Cirrus Logic's revenue -- down slightly from 80% in   the year prior.During Cirrus' most recent earnings call, management talked up   some of the traction that it's seeing in customers beyond both   audio products and Apple.For instance, Cirrus Logic CEO Jason Rhode said that "after   our initial win in a single smartphone model last quarter, we   expanded our footprint with one of the largest Android OEMs and   are now shipping boosted amplifiers in multiple models."He added that Cirrus Logic expects "additional flagship   devices utilizing our technology to launch over the next six   months."As mentioned above, one area where Cirrus looks poised for   growth is in haptic drivers. The company pegged the market   opportunity at $170 million in 2017 and expects it to balloon to   $450 million by 2021.Cirrus Logic's total revenue in its fiscal 2018 was $1.53   billion and analysts expect that figure to be $1.3 billion in   fiscal 2019."As I mentioned we're now shipping a haptic driver in our   first flagship Android smartphone," Rhode said. "While design   activity with our first-generation haptic driver is robust and we   expect new devices to come to market over the next 12 months   using this component, we plan on taping out our first product   design specifically for haptics in the spring of calendar   2019."Cirrus Logic is expected to see its sales fall in the current   fiscal year (fiscal 2019) -- analysts are calling for Cirrus'   sales to decline by 14.8% -- but Rhode appears optimistic that   this isn't going to become a habit."With a robust portfolio of products and innovative road map,   we believe in our ability to expand our share in our target   markets and return to year-over-year revenue growth in [fiscal]   2020," Rhode asserted.Analysts seem to believe the company, but they're only   expecting Cirrus to deliver 4% sales growth and a little more   than 3.8%   earnings-per-share    growth.  10 stocks we like better than Cirrus Logic       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

 By Sruthi Shankar Nov 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Thursday as a batch of weak earnings and Brexit-related concerns sparked a sixth day of selling, with high-growth stocks such as Amazon.com Inc  and Facebook Inc  taking a hit. Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors fell, with more than 1 percent losses in consumer discretionary, defensive real estate  and utilities  indexes. The results come in a big week for retail earnings, with department store operator Macy's Inc  raising its annual earnings forecast on Wednesday, signaling a strong holiday shopping season. However, J.C. Penney Co Inc  slumped 9 percent after quarterly comparable-store sales fell short of analysts' estimates.  U.S. retail sales rebounded sharply in October as demand for motor vehicles and building materials surged. The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.8 percent last month, above the expected 0.5 percent rise.  "Market's choosing not to pick and spare (retail) numbers and most of the retailers are looking forward to the holiday season," said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments, New Vernon, New Jersey.

Strong U.S. economy boosts Walmart's third-quarter sales
 By Nandita Bose NEW YORK, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc  reported higher-than-expected quarterly U.S. comparable sales on Thursday and raised its full year outlook as a strong economy boosted customer store visits and e-commerce purchases grew as it sold more groceries online. The retailer's profits, however, continued to be under pressure. Margins were impacted as Walmart absorbed higher transportation costs and invested heavily in its online business. Strong consumer spending has helped many brick-and-mortar retailers post solid sales gains this quarter, ahead of the key U.S. holiday season even as e-commerce investments have gnawed away profits. "Fresh (food) continues to do very well but there is strength across the board from a category standpoint," Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told Reuters in an interview. Grocery sales make up 56 percent of Walmart's revenue, and at its investor day last month Walmart's Chief Executive Doug McMillon emphasized Walmart's advantage in the food category, an area that rival Amazon.com Inc  is trying to crack, particularly following its acquisition last year of organic grocer Whole Foods. McMillon said Walmart can offer fresh food within 10 miles of 90 percent of the U.S. population. The company has expanded its grocery pickup program, which allows customers to order online and pickup at 2,100 of its U.S. stores. Walmart will also add grocery delivery services to about 800 stores by the end of the year, the retailer's U.S. CEO Greg Foran said. Walmart will overtake Apple Inc  as the third largest e-commerce retailer by sales this year, behind Amazon and eBay Inc, according to data released Thursday by market research firm eMarketer. Walmart is expected to grab 4 percent of U.S. e-commerce sales, or about $20.9 billion, up from 3.3 percent last year, eMarketer said. Walmart's sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 3.4 percent in the third quarter, excluding fuel price fluctuations, higher than analysts' estimates of a 2.87 percent increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Walmart has recorded over four straight years of U.S. growth, unmatched by any other retailer. E-commerce sales soared 43 percent, topping the 40-percent growth in the previous quarter. The retailer has said it is on track for e-commerce sales to rise by 40 percent this year. The retailer has also been on an acquisition spree, buying brands aimed at millennial shoppers who typically don't shop on the retailer's website. Walmart recently bought lingerie retailer Bare Necessities after purchasing plus-sized clothing startup Eloquii a week earlier.  The company's e-commerce business is expected to post a slightly greater operating loss next year, the retailer said during investor day. Walmart's international sales grew 1.6 percent to $30 billion excluding currency impact. In India, one of its key overseas markets, Walmart suffered a setback on Tuesday when the chief executive officer of its Indian e-commerce business Flipkart Group, resigned following an allegation of sexual assault.  Walmart paid $16 billion for a roughly 77-percent stake in Flipkart in May, its biggest acquisition and a major move in competing against Amazon. Walmart's quarterly total revenue increased 2.4 percent to $126.1 billion, excluding currency changes, beating analysts' estimates of $125.56 billion. Adjusted earnings came to $1.08 per share, above expectations of $1.01. Consolidated net income attributable to Walmart for the third quarter stood at $1.71 billion versus $1.75 billion a year ago. Walmart raised its adjusted earnings outlook for fiscal year 2019 to $4.75 to $4.85 per share from $4.65 to $4.80. It also said it expects comparable sales, excluding fuel, to grow "at least" 3 percent, a change from "about" 3 percent earlier in fiscal 2019. 
 
Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.B , $216.03), took a few more bites of Apple ( AAPL ) stock in the most recent quarter. But the big news is that he's bonkers for bank stocks.Berkshire Hathaway added to or bought new stakes in five of the nation's largest commercial banks in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. The holding company also made bets on investment banking, custodial banking and insurance.In addition to finding value in select pockets of the financial sector, the Oracle of Omaha also made a surprising new bet on a technology stock.The world's greatest value investor made several noteworthy moves in the third quarter, according to a new Berkshire Hathaway 13F regulatory filing. (Large investors such as Berkshire are required to disclose their holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission every three months.) The biggest changes to Berkshire's portfolio came in the form of additional stakes and new investments as the company seeks to deploy a hoard of cash that stood at more than $100 billion at the end of the September quarter. But Berkshire also did a little trimming.Since it can be instructive to see what Buffett has been up to, we took a closer look at what Berkshire has been buying and selling. Keep in mind that not all "Warren Buffett stocks" are actually his picks - some smaller positions are believed to be handled by lieutenants Ted Weschler and Todd Combs.That said, here are the most notable recent changes to Berkshire Hathaway's stock holdings.Action: Added to stakeShares held: 252.4 million (+0.2% from Q2)Value: $47.3 billionBerkshire Hathaway made a relatively small addition to its stake in Apple (AAPL, $186.80), picking up another 522,902 shares. Warren Buffett disclosed on CNBC in August that he "bought just a little (more)" during the third quarter.Buffett told CNBC that he loves the power of Apple's brand and its ecosystem of products (such as the iPhone and iPad) and services (such as Apple Pay and iTunes). "I do not focus on the sales in the next quarter or the next year," he said. "I focus on the ... hundreds, hundreds, hundreds millions of people who practically live their lives by (the iPhone)."With a stake of more than 5.3%, Berkshire Hathaway is Apple's third-largest shareholder after fund firms Vanguard Group and BlackRock ( BLK ) - the company behind iShares exchange-traded funds - according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.That stake might have been a painful holding over the past month, as Apple has dropped just about 20% from its Oct. 3 peak.Action: Added to stakeShares held: 65.5 million (+2.9% from Q2)Value: $3.7 billionWarren Buffett continues to be tinker with Berkshire's holdings in the airline industry. Berkshire bought another 1.9 million shares in Delta Air Lines ( DAL , $56.43), upping its stake by 2.9%.Berkshire's holdings in the carrier are worth $3.7 billion. Buffett began investing in Delta and several other airlines in 2016 after decades of shunning the industry, though he has peeled back a little from some of his other holdings, which we'll cover in a bit.It has been quite a reversal. Berkshire Hathaway is now Delta Air Lines' top shareholder. It owns 65.5 million shares, or 9.6%, of DAL's shares outstanding - though that position hasn't done much in 2018, with a barely positive performance.Action: Added to stakeShares held: 77.8 million (+20.1% from Q2)Value: $3.7 billionIt may not be a household name, but Bank of New York Mellon ( BK , $48.23) is a big deal in financial services, and Berkshire Hathaway can't seem to get enough of it.Bank of New York Mellon is a custodian bank that holds assets for institutional clients and provides back-end accounting services. Its roots actually go all the way back to 1784, when Bank of New York was founded by a group including Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr.Warren Buffett added to Berkshire's stake in BK by 20.1%, or more than 13 million shares, in the most recent quarter. With a total of 77.8 million shares, or 7.9% of all shares outstanding, Berkshire Hathaway is Bank of New York Mellon's largest investor.Action: Added to stakeShares held: 124.9 million (+24.1% from Q2)Value: $6.6 billionWarren Buffett bought another 9.8 million shares in U.S. Bancorp ( USB , $54.00) - the nation's fifth-largest bank by assets and its biggest regional bank - in the third quarter.Berkshire Hathaway is U.S. Bancorp's biggest shareholder at 7.7% of all shares outstanding. Vanguard and BlackRock are the second- and third-largest investors in the firm, respectively, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.Analysts at Sandler O'Neill Research, who rate shares at "Hold," say, "our sense is that a number of investors have turned to this name as a sturdier defensive name in the most recent bank stock swoon." USB recently bolstered one of its defensive qualities - on Sept. 18, the company announced it had the green light to increase the dividend by 23%.Action: Added to stakeShares held: 877.2 million (+29.2% from Q2)Value: $23.6 billionWarren Buffett made a major addition to Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Bank of America ( BAC , $27.21). The holding company bought more than 198 million additional shares in the nation's second-largest bank by assets.Buffett's interest in BAC dates back to 2011, when he swooped in to shore up the firm's finances in the wake of the Great Recession. In exchange for investing $5 billion in the bank six years ago, Berkshire received preferred stock yielding 6% and warrants giving Berkshire the right to purchase BofA common stock at a steep discount. (The Oracle of Omaha exercised those warrants in 2017, netting a $12 billion profit in the process.)Buffett has been building Berkshire's stake ever since. The holding company is BAC's largest investor, owning 8.9% of its outstanding shares.Action: Added to stakeShares held: 18.4 million (+38.5% from Q2)Value: $3.7 billionWarren Buffett bought another 5.1 million shares in Goldman Sachs ( GS , $202.49), raising Berkshire Hathaway's stake in the Wall Street investment bank by 38.5%.Berkshire first picked up its stake in Goldman Sachs during the financial crisis in 2008. Buffett paid $5 billion for preferred shares and warrants to purchase common stock. The preferred shares, which Goldman redeemed in 2011, came with a dividend yield of 10%. Berkshire bought another $2 billion in Goldman stock when it exercised the warrants in 2013.Buffett has parlayed the original investment into a 4.9% stake in Goldman Sachs worth $3.7 billion. Berkshire now is the bank's fourth-largest shareholder.Action: New stakeShares held: 3.5 millionValue: $432.3 millionBerkshire Hathaway disclosed a new position in Travelers Cos. ( TRV , $123.04). Travelers - a Dow Jones Industrial Average component that boasts the country's second-largest commercial property casualty insurance writing business - was down roughly 9% for the year-to-date through Nov. 14.The new position of 3.5 million shares, worth about $432.3 million, is small by Berkshire's standards, but it's in keeping with Buffett's bullishness on the financial sector.With 1.3% of Travelers shares outstanding, Berkshire Hathaway is the insurer's ninth-largest shareholder, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.Action: New stakeShares held: 6.1 millionValue: $805.7 millionIn another bullish move for the bank sector, Berkshire Hathaway bought a new stake in PNC Financial ( PNC , $134.13). The Pittsburgh-based regional financial services firm ranks as the nation's sixth-largest bank by assets.The new position makes Berkshire the 11th largest shareholder in PNC with 1.3% of the bank's shares outstanding.Shares in PNC were off 7% for the year-to-date through Nov. 14, before Berkshire disclosed its holdings. Shareholders received a little relief this year, however, in the form of a 27% dividend hike this summer.Action: New stakeShares held: 41.4 millionValue: $2.1 billionHis ardor for Apple notwithstanding, Warren Buffett has traditionally avoided technology stocks. His big bet on International Business Machines ( IBM ), which Berkshire dumped earlier in 2018, was a bust.So it's certainly noteworthy that Berkshire bought a new position in computing giant Oracle ( ORCL , $48.84). The enterprise software and cloud-computing company - whose products and services include the Oracle Cloud, Java, Oracle AI and Internet-of-Things offerings - now counts Berkshire Hathaway as its fifth-largest investor.Berkshire's new stake of 41.4 million shares, worth about $4.1 billion, gives it 1.1% of Oracle's shares outstanding. Buffett likely is expecting more out of ORCL than the paltry 3% gains it has put up so far in 2018.Action: New stakeShares held: 35.7 millionValue: $3.8 billionBerkshire Hathaway's big third-quarter bet on the financial industry included a new $3.8 billion stake in JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , $107.33), the nation's largest bank by assets.The new position gives Berkshire about 1% of the firm's shares outstanding, making it JPM's 12th largest investor, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. More interestingly, Berkshire now has stakes in four of the five largest banks by assets, including top holdings in BAC, USB and Wells Fargo ( WFC ).Followers of Warren Buffett will be keen to see if Berkshire continues to add to its JPM stake in the quarters ahead. Shares in the bank were up less than 1% for the year-to-date through Nov. 14 before Berkshire disclosed its new position.Action: Trimmed stakeShares held: 56.0 million (-0.9% from Q2)Value: $2.9 billionBuffett began investing in airline stocks in 2016 after decades of shunning the industry. As stunning as reversal was, he's still picky, as his latest moves show.Berkshire trimmed its position in Southwest Airlines ( LUV , $52.48) ever so slightly in the most recent quarter, reducing its stake by just less 1%.That's not to say Buffett has given up on the carrier, despite its roughly 20% year-to-date losses. Hardly. Berkshire Hathaway still holds more than 56 million shares in Southwest, worth $2.9 billion. And Berkshire is the second-largest shareholder in LUV, with just under 10% of the airline's shares outstanding.Action: Trimmed stakeShares held: 442.4 million (-2% from Q2)Value: $22.7 billionWarren Buffett trimmed Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Wells Fargo (WFC, $42.26), but like with Southwest, that doesn't mean he's soured on the nation's third-largest bank by assets.Rather, as Buffett has explained in the past, Berkshire aims to keep its ownership of Wells Fargo's shares outstanding to just under 10% in order to avoid triggering regulatory restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve.Wells Fargo suffered a series of setbacks over the past two years stemming from its phony accounts scandal and other black eyes. But Berkshire remains WFC's largest shareholder, with a total of 442.4 million shares, or 9.4% of the bank's shares outstanding.Action: Trimmed stakeShares held: 43.7 million (-2.2% from Q2)Value: $1.6 billionWarren Buffett also lowered the altitude on Berkshire's stake in American Airlines ( AAL , $38.11) during the third quarter. The holding company trimmed its stake in the airline by 2.2%.The sales reduced Berkshire's ownership to 43.7 million shares worth about $1.6 billion.Although Berkshire jettisoned 1 million shares over the course of the quarter, it remained the second-largest shareholder in American Airlines, with 9.5% of its shares outstanding. Unfortunately, AAL has been a drag on Berkshire's performance, as shares have lost more than a quarter of their value so far in 2018.Action: Trimmed stakeShares held: 26.0 million (-2.6% from Q2)Value: $2.4 billionUnited Continental Holdings ( UAL , $91.79) is another one of Buffett's four big original bets on the airline industry, and although he remains committed to the name, he did pull back on the throttle in the most recent quarter.Berkshire Hathaway cut its holdings in the carrier by 2.6% in the third quarter to 26 million shares. The stake is worth about $2.4 billion at current market prices.The good news? Well, for one, the company posted a nearly 30% jump in profit for its most recent quarter thanks to higher fares and robust travel demand. Also, Berkshire Hathaway still is a major UAL owner - at 9.5%, it's the carrier's second-largest investor.Action: Trimmed stakeShares held: 15.4 million (-55.6% from Q2)Value: $1.5 billionBerkshire Hathaway continued to cut bait on oil refiner Phillips 66 ( PSX , $95.60). The holding company unloaded another 15.4 million shares in the third quarter.Buffett first started selling PSX in the first quarter of the year to keep its ownership below 10% and avoid triggering a regulatory headache. The purchaser of the stock in Q1 - for $3.3 billion - was none other than Phillips 66.It's not clear what's driving the latest selling, however. Berkshire Hathaway is the fourth-largest shareholder in PSX, but with just 3.3% of its shares outstanding, it's far from the 10% regulatory threshold. And the collapse in oil prices that led most energy stocks (including Phillips 66) lower didn't take hold until after the third quarter.Action: Exited stakeShares sold: 1.4 millionWarren Buffett is officially done with Walmart ( WMT , $101.53).Berkshire Hathaway sold the majority of its holdings in the world's largest retailer back in 2016 and has been trimming its position ever since. And as of the end of the third quarter 2018, Berkshire completely exited its position.Berkshire, which first ventured into Walmart stock in 2005, had amassed more than 60 million shares by the end of 2015. That amounted to a sizable 2% ownership stake.The main reason Buffett abandoned Walmart? It's losing out to Amazon.com ( AMZN ), David Kass, a professor at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business who studies Buffett and is a Berkshire shareholder, told Kiplinger in 2017 .
 At its Oct. 30 product launch event,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) introduced redesigned versions of its high-end   iPad Pro tablets. The new tablets come in versions with 11-inch   and 12.9-inch screens -- the former is a bit bigger than the   10.5-inch screen in last year's model, while the latter's screen   is the same as its predecessor's but the device itself is smaller   thanks to slimmed-down bezels.In addition to a casing redesign, the new iPad Pros   incorporate a new   A12X Bionic chip    that's significantly faster than the prior-generation A10X   Fusion, do away with the home button and Touch ID in favor of   swipe gestures and the company's Face ID facial recognition   technology, and can be configured with up to 1TB of internal   storage.  Image source: Apple.Oh, and the company introduced a second-generation Apple   Pencil for the devices, too.Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo with TF International Securities recently   published a report (via   MacRumors    ) in which he talked about one of the key new features he expects   to see in Apple's next iPad Pro. Let's dive into that and offer   up some thoughts on what else Apple could improve with the   next-generation iPad Pro tablets.Kuo wrote that he gives better-than-even odds that the iPad   that Apple introduces in either the fourth quarter of 2019 or the   first quarter of 2020 "may adopt [time-of-flight]."As MacRumors explains, "[a] time-of-flight camera system is   designed to determine the distance between objects by measuring   the time-of-flight of a light or laser signal between the camera   and the subject at each point in the image."Put simply, the rear-facing camera of the next iPad Pro should   get 3D sensing capability."We believe that 3D modeling captured by ToF and then edited   by an Apple Pencil on an iPad will create an all-new productivity   experience for design applications in a totally different manner   from computers," said Kuo.By enabling interesting use cases that simply aren't possible   (or convenient) in other form factors, Apple could help to boost   demand for its latest iPad products. During Apple's fiscal 2018,   iPad unit shipments were about flat year over year at 43.5   million units, and revenue dropped 2%.Although that potential iPad Pro camera upgrade sounds quite   compelling, Apple's mighty research and development organization   is unlikely to be content with just a single upgrade. In the next   iPad Pro, expect Apple to deliver a new A13X applications   processor that meaningfully boosts GPU, CPU, and Neural Engine   (used for machine learning tasks) performance over the   current-generation A12X Bionic.The A12X Bionic is already best in class along the relevant   performance vectors, and I'd expect that to continue with next   year's iPad Pro tablets, which likely will be powered by an A13X   chip.The display is a critical part of any computing experience,   which is why the company invests so heavily in making sure its   devices all have great looking screens. Apple's latest iPad Pros   still make use of liquid crystal displays, or LCDs, instead of   the OLED technology that the company uses in its latest iPhone XS   and   iPhone XS Max    smartphones.The LCDs on the new iPad Pros are, of course, very nice --   NotebookCheck's   testing    of the 12.9-inch model reveals the screen to be very bright and   color accurate and to have a very high contrast ratio of   1975-to-1 -- but there are advantages to OLED screens such as   superior contrast and faster pixel response times. However, about   a year ago, Bloomberg   reported    that this year's iPad Pros wouldn't have OLED screens due to   "technical and financial constraints."If Apple and its display manufacturing partner(s) can work   through those problems and deliver bright, fast, and beautiful   OLED screens to next year's iPad Pro tablets, that could be a   significant generation-over-generation upgrade.

 By Kirsti Knolle VIENNA, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Austria's AMS, which makes facial recognition technology, became the latest Apple supplier to cut its revenue forecast, adding to growing evidence that the latest iPhones are not selling well. The Swiss-listed group cut its fourth-quarter revenue outlook by 15 percent and pushed back its medium-term targets, blaming "recent demand changes from a major customer". Apple  shocked investors two weeks ago with a lower than expected sales forecast for the Christmas quarter, prompting suppliers including U.S. firm Lumentum, British chipmaker IQE  and screen maker Japan Display  to issue warnings that pointed to weakness in new iPhone sales.  Like Lumentum, AMS supplies Apple with software components needed for its FaceID technology. Anglo-German chip designer Dialog Semiconductor, which struck a $600 million deal with the U.S. tech giant last month bucked the negative trend when it said late on Wednesday it does not see a drop in demand from Apple. Dialog justified this by pointing out that it supplies many more products than the latest iPhones.  The California-based firm started selling its latest phone generation, the iPhone XS and XS Max in September and the XR model last month. The new AMS guidance suggested between 11 and 18 million fewer iPhones would be produced in the fourth quarter than an initially estimated 77-82 million, Credit Suisse analysts said in a note to customers. "This is largely in-line to read from recent Lumentum warning," they said, adding the Lumentum guidance would have implied an impact of 15-20 million iPhones. 
 VOLATILE SHARES AMS shares gained as much as 6.4 percent to 29.65 Swiss francs after a steep drop in early trade. They have lost nearly 30 percent since Apple's latest earnings release and are down 70 percent since the beginning of the year and some investors see a buying opportunity, said traders. AMS expects revenue to come in between $480 million and $520 million in the three months to Dec. 31, compared with the $570-$610 million it forecast last month. The adjusted operating margin for the quarter is expected to reach the low to mid-teen percentage range after previous guidance for the margin to rise to 16-20 percent. AMS also abandoned its 2019 revenue target of more than $2.7 billion, saying it now expects annual double-digit revenue growth for the coming years. It still aims for a 30 percent adjusted operating margin but no longer gives a specific time frame. It had already postponed the target to 2020 from 2019 in July, at the time due to order delays from a major customer. "These guys have no visibility any more," said Mark Taylor, senior sales trader at Mirabaud Securities' Global Thematic Group. AMS, which has invested heavily in research and development and in production expansion, is now seeking to address  underutilised facilities, increasing competition and its reliance on Apple. Although a number of analysts have cut their recommendations recently, many target price recommendations are still above 40 Swiss francs. "I wouldn't be surprised to see (the stock) rally," said Taylor.

 By John Miller and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi ZURICH, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Switzerland's competition watchdog has raided the offices of financial companies, including Credit Suisse  and UBS, to investigate a suspected boycott of mobile payment solutions such as Apple Pay  and Samsung Pay. The competition authority said it was investigating whether the banks, including state-owned PostFinance, colluded with local payments providers not to use the mobile payment systems of the big tech companies. Some of the companies targeted in the probe said the regulator's accusations were without merit. "We are surprised about this investigation and are convinced that the allegations will prove to be unfounded," Credit Suisse said in a statement. Credit Suisse said it offers Swiss consumers access to Apple Pay and Samsung Pay through its 50 percent subsidiary Swisscard and has also been in talks with Apple, Samsung and Google  over how their solutions can be used. UBS acknowledged the investigation and said it had tried to reach an agreement with Apple Pay over use of the Swiss bank's credit cards as early as 2016, but had not managed to come to an understanding with the company. "Although we offered a number of alternative solutions, unfortunately we weren't able to reach an agreement with Apple Pay to cooperate," a UBS spokeswoman said. Postfinance, part of Switzerland's postal service and one of the country's largest banks, also said it did not breach Swiss cartel law and said it was cooperating with the WEKO probe. TWINT AG, a joint venture between Switzerland's biggest banks to create a digital payments system, said it was "astonished" by the competition commission's approach. TWINT said its offices were raided by the watchdog even though it is not under investigation. TWINT also said it had previously submitted a complaint against Apple over unfair competitive practices. "TWINT itself asked the (Competition Commission) some time ago to investigate discriminatory behaviour by Apple towards TWINT, because Apple prevents the trouble-free use of the TWINT app on IOS devices," it said. "A decision of the WEKO in this matter is expected shortly." An Apple spokesman in Switzerland could not immediately be reached for comment on the TWINT allegations. Disputes between mobile payment systems and banks have cropped up elsewhere too.  Last year, a decision by Australia's competition watchdog stopped the country's banks from collectively trying to introduce their own mobile applications for contactless payments on Apple's phones and watches.  (graphic). Apple Pay entered Switzerland in 2016 as the first major rival to TWINT, which was launched in the same year but has not yet made big inroads into Switzerland's payments market. TWINT in April said mobile payments in Switzerland had yet to gain traction the way they had in other countries, with just an estimated 0.2 percent of all payments occurring over smartphone in the country. It said it had reached 750,000 users as of April 2018, a step down from the one million it had been targeting by end-2017. The competition watchdog said its investigation included Aduno Holding, PostFinance, Swisscard AECS GmbH and Swiss units of Credit Suisse and UBS. Aduno confirmed that its offices in Zurich were searched by Swiss authorities and said it was cooperating with the investigation. It declined further comment.

It said it had reached 750,000 users as of April 2018, a step down from the one million it had been targeting by end-2017. The competition watchdog said its investigation included Aduno Holding, PostFinance, Swisscard AECS GmbH and Swiss units of Credit Suisse and UBS. Aduno confirmed that its offices in Zurich were searched by Swiss authorities and said it was cooperating with the investigation. It declined further comment. 
 
Chinese regulator orders detailed user data to fight online mobilisation
 By Cate Cadell BEIJING, Nov 15 (Reuters) - China's cyber watchdog said on Thursday it will require detailed logs on users from internet firms as part of a new policy aimed at cracking down on dissenting opinion and online social movements. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said that as of Nov. 30 it will require assessment reports from any internet platform that could be used to "socially mobilise" or lead to "major changes in public opinion". The CAC, in its policy notice posted on its website, did not name specific companies affected, but listed a wide range of services including chat functions, blogs, public accounts, web casts, video sites and news providers. Companies with those functions include Tencent Holdings Ltd, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Baidu Inc  as well as Apple Inc, which hosts its message service in China. Control of the internet has tightened under President Xi Jinping - an effort that has accelerated since 2016, as the ruling Communist Party seeks to crack down on dissent in the booming social media landscape. In Chinese cyber policy, content that "undermines" social stability, manipulates history or runs counter to the government line is deemed a cybersecurity risk, comparable to financial and terrorist cyber threats. According to the terms and conditions of social media services, including the Twitter-like service Weibo and Tencent's WeChat, tech companies are already required to share information with the government on request, though there is little transparency on the exact process. Companies have increasingly introduced new features to boost government influence over platforms and quash viral content in order to avoid fines, suspensions and in some cases, permanent closure. On Tuesday, the CAC said it had scrubbed 9,800 social media accounts of independent news providers deemed to have posted sensational, vulgar or politically harmful content.  The new policy comes amid a spate of protests from grassroots movements ranging from labour rights to #MeToo protests. On Wednesday, students at prestigious Peking University were warned against taking part in demonstrations after 12 labour activists, most of them students, went missing from cities across the country over the weekend, including at least one seized on campus at Peking University.  Censorship controls are also tightening as U.S. tech giants are expanding, including Apple and Alphabet Inc'sGoogle, which has been criticised over secretive plans to launch a censored search engine in China.  
 
Apple ( AAPL ) has been one of my largest individual holdings for the bulk of the post-recession stock bull. I believed in it when it was trading for one-tenth of its current value back in 2009. I even believed in it when it plummeted 40% in the winter of 2012-2013.Back then, though, Apple's troubles did not adversely affect the broader equity rally. On the contrary. The S&P 500 exhibited all of the signs of a powerful uptrend.More recently, Apple has been moving in lockstep with the large-cap barometer. The circumstance may prove detrimental to those who think the current downtrend is little more than a hiccup.The collective movement of thousands of individual securities rarely depends on an individual company or a single sector. The "FANG trade" - Facebook ( FB ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Netflix, ( NFLX ), Google Alphabet ( GOOG ) (GOOGL) - actually began to unwind in July. And yet, the major indexes still logged new records in September.Still, the shift away from prior market leaders in the technology and consumer discretionary segments burdened Apple tremendously. With FANG accounting for nearly 25% of the NASDAQ 100 proxy, Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), Apple's 13% weighting has become that much more critical for bull market well-being.It's not that Apple is incapable of bouncing back quickly. It recovered steep January losses in the month of February.On the flip side, weakening iPhone sales have not been helpful for the semiconductor space. Indeed, "chip" stocks often foreshadow economic downturns.There are those who are focused so intently on the recent strength of the domestic economy that they are unable to see the forest for the trees. For example, oil prices do not lose 25% in value in a matter of weeks when global demand is strong. Not ever. Nor is this merely a case of excess supply.In truth, the world's economy has been slowing to a crawl. The German economy contracted in the third quarter. Meanwhile, China is dealing with a massive debt bubble and a trade war. (Note: China is the world's largest importer of oil.)Is it possible that the U.S. stock market is demonstrating that it cannot decouple from the rest of the world after all? Not only is the iShares MSCI All-World Index (ACWI) negative on the year, but the slope of the global equity barometer is negative as well.Rising interest rates have damaged bonds, preferreds and most income-oriented investments. Commodities have been rocked by a rising U.S. dollar. Clearly, none of these asset types have helped total return for diversified investors.One also diversifies in the stock space. Foreign, domestic, large, small. Small company U.S. stocks also are negative for 2018. And with the 50-day moving average crossing below the 200-day moving average, the technical picture is relatively bleak.Aren't smaller companies supposed to benefit form a strong domestic economic backdrop? They're not.A diversified investor with a helping of large-cap stocks, small-cap stocks, foreign stocks, commodities, bonds, preferreds and/or other income producers had been relying on the influence of mega-caps like Facebook, Amazon and Apple. Bearish price depreciation in one or two of them might have been tolerable. Not all three.Effective 11/1, I lowered large-cap U.S. allocation from 55%-60% to 30%-35% for most of my retiree and near-retiree clients. The S&P 500 was at 2740. It closed today's session (11/14) at 2701.The tactical asset allocation move was made in conjunction with a time-tested discipline that has outperformed the S&P 500 with less risk (e.g., drawdown, standard deviation, Sharpe, etc.) for 10 years, 20 years, 25 years and 90 years. Performance notwithstanding, balanced growth-and-income investors never invest 100% of their principal in large-cap equities. It follows that beating the U.S large-cap barometer is not the goal.Nevertheless, I encourage readers to research the remarkable results for the monthly close of the 10-month moving average . My success at minimizing the bulk of the tech wreck's decimation (2000-2002) as well as the financial system's collapse (2008) is largely attributable to this approach.U.S. stocks bounded dramatically higher as election uncertainty dissipated. That said, the enthusiasm does not appear to have held up. The S&P 500 benchmark appears as though it will retest the lows of late October.We already have reduced stock risk to protect capital in the near term. If the bull market finds itself again - if Apple gets its groove back - we would restore risk.Until then, a risk-off positioning will remain. JPMorgan Ultra-Short Income (JPST), PIMCO Enhanced Short Maturity (MINT) and Invesco Ultra Short Duration (GSY) are viable cash equivalents.Disclosure : Gary Gordon, MS, CFP is the president of Pacific Park Financial, Inc., a Registered Investment Adviser with the SEC.

 When market volatility hits hard like it has in October and   November, investors have all the more reason to appreciate   high-quality    dividend   stocks    . Though stock prices can rise and fall alongside market   volatility, dividends are less likely to see any sudden changes   -- especially dividends paid by profitable market leaders.Fortunately, a pullback in many stocks over the last month and   a half has created some compelling buying opportunities for   opportunistic investors. Therefore, if you're looking to beef up   your portfolio with more income-generating stocks, now is a good   time to go shopping. One stock, in particular, looks attractive   after its recent sell-off:   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) .  A packed Apple store after the iPhone XS launch in China.     Image source: Apple.A portion of Apple's decline over the last month and a half   can be attributed to an overall pullback in the prices of tech   stocks, as evidenced by the tech-heavy   Nasdaq Composite    's 11% decline during this timeframe.However, there's more to Apple's decline than broader-market   headwinds. Rumors that Apple's iPhone XR is not performing as   well as expected have been weighing on the tech giant's stock as   well. On Monday, well-regarded Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo cut his   fiscal 2019 shipment estimates for the new iPhone from 100   million units to 70 million units.Are these good reasons for a 17% pullback in Apple's stock   price? Probably not.First, there's the simple fact that Apple is paying out a   higher dividend yield today than it was last month thanks to its   stock's sharp decline. Down 17% since October 1, Apple now has a   dividend yield of 1.5%, up from 1.2% at the start of last   month.Further, investors who buy Apple stock today not only get a   higher dividend yield than they would have if they'd bought a few   months ago, but they'll get a rapidly growing dividend as well.   Highlighting how Apple has prioritized its dividend, the company   has increased the quarterly payout at an average rate of about   11% annually over the past five years. Further, Apple most   recently increased its dividend    by a more meaningful 16%.The case for Apple stock goes beyond the company's dividend.   Despite all the recent negative headlines surrounding Apple's   latest iPhone cycles, the tech giant's latest results show a   thriving iPhone business. In Apple's most recent quarter, for   instance, iPhone revenue was up 29% year over year. Further,   for Apple's entire fiscal year of 2018, iPhone revenue increased   an impressive 18% year over year. With this background in mind,   it's tough to say Apple's iPhone business is struggling.Sure, investors will want to keep an eye on Apple's iPhone   business in the coming quarters; but recent results show a market   leader that continues to flex its pricing power, leading to sharp   revenue and earnings-per-share growth. Apple's revenue and   earnings per share increased 16% and 29% year over year,   respectively, in fiscal 2018.Fortunately, Apple doesn't need to grow iPhone revenue   meaningfully to live up to its valuation. After the stock's   pullback recently, shares are now trading at just 17 times   earnings. And even if Apple's iPhone business does run into   headwinds in the coming years, the company has   two fast-growing segments    that look poised to be meaningful catalysts for years to come.   Apple's services and "other products" segments, which together   account for 23% of total revenue, saw their revenue increase 24%   and 35% year over year, respectively, in fiscal 2018 -- and   strong momentum in the App store and in wearables should help   these two segments keep growing rapidly.

    The stock market took a dive on Wednesday thanks mostly to Apple (AAPL) and a broader decline in bank shares.The Dow Jones fell 350 points at one point after rising over 200 points earlier in the day. The S&P 500 pulled back about 1.3% while the Nasdaq Composite traded 1.3% lower.Shares of Apple AAPL  took a big hit after Guggenheim downgraded the stock. This downgrade comes as UBS slashed its 12-month price target on AAPL and a target drop at Goldman Sachs. Overall, investors are worried about a slowdown in future iPhone sales.Shares of Goldman Sachs GS  , J.P. Morgan Chase JPM  and Citigroup C  all fell as well after Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters said the Trump administration's efforts to limit banking regulations "will come to an end."Stocks were also affected after Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-NJ, told Bloomberg News that the updated trade deal between the U.S., Canada and Mexico needs to be changed before it can pass through Congress.Wednesday's shaky moves follow a volatile trading session on Tuesday, with the Dow falling around 100 points at the close. 3 Medical Stocks to Buy Now  
  Qorvo, Inc  . QRVO  recently provided an update on third-quarter fiscal 2019 outlook.    Qorvo, Inc. Revenue (TTM)      Qorvo, Inc. Revenue (TTM)    |      Qorvo, Inc. Quote  Q2 at a Glance    Qorvo is benefiting from increased demand in the performance-tier for RF Fusion based solutions, antenna tuning, discrete components and BAW-based multiplexers. The company delivered stellar second-quarter results, wherein both the top and bottom lines outpaced the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.    Qorvo delivered second-quarter fiscal 2019 non-GAAP earnings of $1.75 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62 per share. The figure jumped 15.1% from the year-ago quarter.    Revenues on a non-GAAP basis increased 7.6% year over year to $884.4 million. The figure was above management's guidance of $850-$860 million and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $856 million. Robust mobile growth, improved progress in IDP and stringent cost control measures drove revenue growth.   Key Takeaway    Reportedly, in the recent past, Apple AAPL  selected Qorvo as the secondary supplier of low-band power amplifier/duplexer (PAD) filter for its iPhone XR over Broadcom AVGO  . However, the iPhone maker reportedly asked suppliers to ditch plans for additional production lines for the iPhone XR, citing lesser than expected demand for iPhone X handsets.    Notably, Lumentum Holdings LITE  , which supplies 3D chips used in FaceID architecture, recently lowered revenue guidance by 17.4% at mid-point levels from $405 million to $430 million to $335 million to $355 million, cautioning investors that one of its biggest clients had recently reduced the scope of its order.    In fact, IQE announced that on Nov 12, was informed by a chip making customer regarding reduced demand for 3D sensing laser diodes by "one of their largest customers." Following this, the chip company significantly curtailed shipments for the ongoing quarter, which in turn led to revision in IQE's outlook. Notably, IQE provides silicon-based wafers required in making 3D computing chips to Lumentum.    These trimming guidance trends hold a key in authenticating lesser-than-expected demand of latest iPhones. However, Apple is known to keep its suppliers on their toes wherein slight changes in demand of iPhone related devices create a stir among the company's supplier base. To add on to the woes, Apple's vertical integration policy is also a headwind to the suppliers. Qorvo, Inc. Price and Consensus       Qorvo, Inc. Price and Consensus    |      Qorvo, Inc. Quote Notably, Apple accounted for 36% of Qorvo's total revenues in fiscal 2018.   To Conclude    Although, customer concentration due to significant exposure to Apple is a headwind, strength in Qorvo's solutions in defense (advanced radars and other electronic warfare products) and connectivity (Wi-Fi and emerging IoT applications) bode well.    With a broad product portfolio, Qorvo is well poised to diversify end-markets beyond mobile devices to network infrastructure and aerospace/defense domains, as well.    Rapid adoption of GaN for high-power applications deserves a special mention. Further, accelerating timeline for 5G deployment bodes well for Qorvo. The company has participated in dozens of 5G field trials and demonstrations.    Qorvo carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The Optimism Game: Which Player Matters Most for Stocks?
    Do you know what the number one currency in the world is? Is it the US dollar, or the euro, or even the Chinese yuan?It's none of those. The number one currency for global economies and financial markets is confidence.We learned that lesson in a big way during the post-Lehman financial crisis when large banks like JPMorgan JPM  , Goldman Sachs GS  and Bank of America BAC  , were near collapse and foreshadowing a major economic depression.It took massive liquidity and backstopping measures by central banks to shore up the commercial and investment banks and restore stability and liquidity, as prerequisites for confidence.The global economy seems a long way away from another crisis, but I find that keeping tabs on quantitative confidence trends is still always a good practice.In the video that accompanies this article, I look at those trends from three different groups of economic and market participants.Each will shed light on a different time frame of concern: the near-term of a few weeks, the medium term of 1-3 months, and the longer term of 3-12 months. Institutional Investors: Medium-Term Macro Angst I begin with the money that moves stocks. Fund managers of all stripes -- mutual, pension, insurance, hedge, endowment, bank, etc. -- are negative right now because they see all kinds of macro worries, such as these 5 sleep-deprivers...Global growth slowdown   Earnings deceleration for US corporates These worries are forcing an exodus from high-growth, high-valuation market leaders like Amazon AMZN  and even from Technology value plays like Apple AAPL  .In the video, I show 3 key measures of large investor confidence, or lack thereof. And I share my estimation of when and what it will take to turn this important group net positive again on stocks, to ensure new highs above S&P 3,000 next year. Newsletter Intelligence: Short-Term Swings of Optimism   and Pessimism My favorite investor sentiment view is the Investors Intelligence survey. It's done weekly and has 3 decades of data going back to 1987.And it's a classic "contrarian" indicator as the newsletter writers tend to get too bullish when stock prices are high and too bearish when they correct.In the video, I go over the 3 views of this survey data that point me toward a conclusion of weaker stock prices this month to wash-out the current complacency. The primary metrics show a big drop in bullishness (optimism) in the past six weeks, but I think bearishness (pessimism) needs to rise further as the market tests the October correction lows.This will provide a stronger contrarian buy signal  , as is historically typical at significant market bottoms.Accordingly, I tightened up risk and raised cash this week for a trip below S&P 2700 which we are seeing unfold as I type. Backbone Confidence: Long-Term Economic Health Felt By   Consumers and Small Business But I'm not long-term bearish on stocks. That's because of the still-strong economic backbone, US consumers and small business confidence and optimism.In the video, I have two key charts to show you in this realm that speak of steady growth in the latter innings of what could be the longest economic expansion ever -- especially as interest rates still have plenty of room to run higher without causing a recession.In conclusion, we have three groups of economic players who tell us every month -- sometimes every week -- where their money, and emotions, are going.We not only need to listen and pay attention. We also need to sort out what time frames matter for each group so that we know how to use their bias for our own goals.Then we can be on the profitable side of short-term and long-term opportunities.

Wall Street limped into the close on Wednesday with the Dow losing another 200 points as a correction in Apple ( AAPL  ) and worrisome headlines that Congress could roll back deregulation in the banking industry pulled the blue chip index below its 200-day moving average and the S&P 500 in the red for a fifth straight day.Stocks were kept afloat into today's open by a sizable rebound in oil futures and strength in the auto sector. Inflation data was also supportive as consumer prices were only modestly higher while core consumer prices were lower on an annualized basis, lifting the Dow more than 200 points at the open.Within the first few minutes of trade, gains evaporated when worries about the US/Mexico/Canada trade deal surfaced, the rally in oil futures fizzled and Apple slipped under its 200-day moving average as analyst's downgrades weighed. The tech-giant was negative for a fifth straight day, its longest losing streak since April while the Nasdaq landed at an eleven day low.The banking sector was under pressure as well after Representative Maxine Waters -- the likely candidate to head the House Financial Services Committee -- said easing banking regulations "will come to an end" after the Democrats take over the House. Dow component Goldman Sachs ( GS  ) fell to its lowest level in two years contributing to the banking sector being today's worst performing sector of the S&P 500.On the plus side, oil emerged from a record-setting losing streak with West Texas intermediate higher for the first time in twelve days amid proposed OPEC production cuts.Related markets reflected to defensive tone in equities with gold more than $10 higher per ounce and Treasury yields pulling back as much as 3 basis points. The dollar was lower against the majors as Brexit headlines continued to dominate trade and underpin the British pound.The economic calendar picks up considerably on Thursday with initial jobless claims, the November Philadelphia Fed Business Outlook index, October retail sales, the November Empire State manufacturing survey, October import and export prices, and September business inventories and sales.US MARKETSDow Jones Industrial Average was down 205.99 (-0.81%)S&P 500 was down 20.60 points (-0.76%)Nasdaq Composite Index was down 64.48 points (-0.90%)GLOBAL SENTIMENTFTSE 100 was down 0.28%Nikkei 225 was up 0.16%Hang Seng Index was down 0.54%Shanghai China Composite Index was down 0.85%UPSIDE MOVERS(+) ANY (+59.18%) Completed sale of Overland Storage(+) NYNY (+53.93%) Forms alliance with bet365 to offer sports betting at Catskills resort(+) TAHO (+48.64%) To be acquired by Pan American Silver ( PAAS  ) for $1.29 billion in cash and stocks(+) LENS (+24.08%) Reported better-than-expected Q3 results, net loss narrowsDOWNSIDE MOVERS(-) RESN (-41.21%) Announced sale of $50 million debt and equity offering, missed Q3 EPS and sales estimates(-) AMRS (-29.83%) Q3 revenue missed estimates, posted wider-than-expected loss(-) PCG (-23.79%) Draws down revolving credit in anticipation of liability for CA fire(-) SWCH (-23.65%) Missed Q3 EPS estimates, revenue was in-line
 During its Oct. 30 product event,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) launched a slate of new products, including new   iPad Pro tablets and   long overdue overhauls of its MacBook Air   notebook computer and Mac Mini desktop computer    .However, Apple didn't upgrade either its iMac or iMac Pro   all-in-one desktop computers.  Image source: Apple.Of course, Apple isn't going to say why it didn't update   certain product lines -- it generally doesn't talk about future   products -- but we can try to make educated guesses. I'd like to   offer mine.First off, it's clear that the iMac needs an update. The   current models ship with   Intel    (NASDAQ: INTC) 7th Gen Core processors which, frankly, are   outdated. The chip giant has been shipping 8th Gen Core desktop   processors that'd offer sizable performance jumps over those 7th   Gen Core processors for a while.In fact, those processors are found inside of Apple's freshly   announced Mac Mini desktop computers.Since processor availability isn't the limiting factor,   then assuming that Apple   wanted    to get an updated iMac out but simply didn't, something else must   be going on here.A little while back, respected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo with TF   International Securities (via   MacRumors    ) said that a new iMac was coming this year that would   incorporate "a significant display performance upgrade."MacRumors said that Kuo didn't "go into detail about what this   [significant display upgrade] will entail."The current iMac with a Retina 4K display is already very   sharp (the name gives that away), bright (Apple claims 500 nits),   and supports wide color. The main "significant display upgrade"   that comes to mind is a ProMotion display (a display that   supports higher refresh rates as well as variable refresh rates),   like the ones found on the 2017 and 2018 iPad Pro tablets.Perhaps producing such displays in volume while meeting   Apple's desired performance requirements is proving more   challenging than Apple or its display manufacturing partners had   hoped?Apple's iMac Pro is a higher-end version of the standard iMac.   One of the distinguishing features of the iMac Pro is that it   incorporates Intel's workstation-grade Xeon W processors. These   processors generally have significantly more cores than the   mainstream desktop processors that Apple uses in the iMac.For example, today's iMac tops out with a quad-core chip while   the iMac Pro   starts    with an eight-core chip and can be configured with an 18-core   processor.Interestingly, while newer iMac-worthy processors are   available today, Intel has yet to launch new versions of its Xeon   W processors. Intel's Xeon W processors and its   Core X-series processors    share the same basic designs, but the Xeon W parts have some   additional features enabled (e.g., support for ECC memory) and   aren't unlocked (meaning that users can't manually adjust the   processor speeds to levels outside of Intel's   specifications).Intel announced its latest Core X-series processors --   essentially refreshed versions of the Core X-series chips that   launched in 2017 -- at an October event and the first reviews of   those refreshed parts went live on Nov. 13.An alternative explanation, then, for the lack of an iMac   update could simply be that Apple wanted to update both the iMac   and the iMac Pro at the same time and it couldn't do that without   an appropriate Xeon W processor refresh.

The Dow continued to fall today, dropping for a fourth straight session -- its longest losing streak since August -- despite starting the day higher.  Apple (   AAPL    ) stock   flirted with bear-market territory after downgrades from Guggenheim and UBS, sinking for a fifth straight day to mark its longest losing streak since April.

  (RTTNews.com) - The Thai stock market headed south again on Wednesday, one day after it had ended the two-day losing streak in which it had fallen more than 25 points or 1.6 percent. The Stock Exchange of Thailand now rests just above the 1,650-point plateau and it's called lower again on Thursday. The global forecast for the Asian markets remains soft, with technology stocks likely to continue to weigh. The European and U.S. markets were down and the Asian bourses figure to follow that lead. The SET finished modestly lower on Wednesday following losses from the financial shares and the energy producers.

5 Top Stock Trades for Thursday: Apple’s Bear Market, Snap’s Investigation
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsStocks got off to a robust start on Wednesday, before fading lower in afternoon trading. The action is really starting to frustrate investors who thought they'd be enjoying a market-wide rally into year-end. So far that hasn't been the case and a look at our top stock trades will show where some of the pain has been.We can't ignore Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) with this type of action, now that shares are down more than 20% from the highs. By definition this puts Apple in bear market territory.When will the selling end?It's hard to say. As worries over iPhone units sales continue to persist in the analyst community, Apple stock is subject to further downgrades. The good news? Business is going quite well and will for the foreseeable future.Below all three moving averages is not a good sign, but down big from the highs and Apple should soon find support. The $175 to $180 level is significant and that's provided uptrend support (black lines) don't play a role. I would nibble some now for a long-term hold.The Department of Justice and SEC are investigating  Snap (NYSE: SNAP ) for its IPO and whether it mislead investors.I thought the stock would be getting hit harder on the news, but it's holding up surprisingly well, down "just" 4%. But it leaves shares clinging to the backside of prior downtrend resistance, as well as a support level near $6.40.Below this and its lows at $6 are on the table. On a rally, it needs to clear its recent highs over $7-and-change.Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO ) will report earnings after the close. Prior to the last week of trading, Cisco was actually looking pretty good, just a hair under its 52-week high.Then the stock sank almost 10% in just a few days and is now below both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages.Honestly, I kind of like this price action going into the report. It lowers the bar and is a favor for bulls looking to go long. The post-earnings action is important too though. On a rally, let's see if we can get back through these major moving averages. On the downside, look for support at the 200-day and uptrend support.Where does Adobe Systems (NASDAQ: ADBE ) settle down if this $230 to $235 area gives way?That's a great question and one that's not readily available.The 50-day and 100-day moving averages are sloping lower and shares are below the 200-day. They are also teetering on that support level in the low-$230 range. About a month ago, Adobe stock sprung from these levels after management guided for a strong finish to 2018 and another impressive year in 2019.Right now the market doesn't seem to care as it threatens to send Adobe lower. Do investors buy this right here, right now?Maybe nibbling a long-term position, but traders should wait for a close over $255. That gets ADBE over several overhead resistance levels and will likely mean the market is in a more bullish state. At the very least, the wind will be at its back.I really wanted to cover an index here, but we can get to that on Thursday because the price action in natural gas is too crazy to ignore.The United States Natural Gas ETF (NYSEARCA: UNG ) ripped more than 18% on the day and is now up more than 44% over the past trading sessions. My condolences go out to the short-sellers, who are certainly feeling the pain on this one.So what now?UNG becomes a no-touch for me. Yes, I see the near-90 RSI reading (blue circle) and the huge move. But those who shorted UNG on Tuesday at $33 probably though it was overdone too. Those traders are only down 18% in a day. That said, I certainly wouldn't be buying this and looking for more upside. Let's just see how it plays out. Just because a stock moves, doesn't mean we need to play it.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell .

 By Trevor Hunnicutt NEW YORK, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Increased regulation of U.S. technology companies is one of the biggest risks to a sector that has led stocks higher, potentially derailing the market's near-decade-long bull run if it suffers a sustained selloff. The S&P 500 tech sector  has risen 5 percent in price terms this year, outpacing the S&P 500  which has gained 1 percent. "It is something to focus on as a risk because tech has been leading the stock market," said Fels. "It's leading on the way up but also on the way down so that's something to be focused on the risk of regulatory action." New data privacy laws in the European Union have already raised costs for tech companies, but investors think more laws or regulatory action could be in the offing.  Facebook Inc, the world's largest social media network, in particular, has been facing scrutiny in Europe and the United States. Facebook'sMark Zuckerberg was grilled in April for about 10 hours by legislators in the House and Senate to address a scandal that saw data on its users leaked to political operatives.  Lawmakers in both houses, and on both sides of the aisle, raised concerns about whether Facebook could regulate itself. Even Zuckerberg said regulation of his industry is "inevitable" during his testimony. He said the company has taken action to address concerns. Facebook came under pressure following allegations by a whistleblower that British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed users' information to build profiles on American voters that were later used to help elect U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016.  In addition to concerns by investors and some lawmakers about data privacy and political influence are fears about cellphone use by children, antitrust problems and a broader deterioration of market sentiment. Market leadership of Facebook and its increased share  volatility of late along with that of other social media companies, such as Snap Inc, have kept equity markets at odds over whether a near-decade long bull market can continue. Hedge funds struggled to bet against market-leading technology firms as their shares rose. And then when many funds took large stakes in Facebook and other so-called 'FANG' stocks, they collapsed in October. Netflix  and Amazon.com, which along with Facebook and Alphabet Inc  make up the so-called "FANG" stocks. A New York Stock Exchange index of FANG and other related stocks is up 11.8 percent in price terms this year but fell 7.2 percent in October. "The EU regulatory and competition authorities are going to step in," said Kyle Bass, founder and principal at Hayman Capital Management LP, addressing the antitrust concerns. "This idea of monopoly and monopsony are coming to the forefront of the regulatory conversations, and somehow they're going to figure out how to regulate such things." The Bank of America Corp fund managers' survey this month found that FANGs were considered the most crowded trade for the tenth straight month. The term crowded trade refers to a widely-held investment seen as especially at risk for outsized losses in the future. Andrew Left, the founder of Citron Research and a prominent short-seller, said he covered his short position on Facebook, due to its booming Instagram business, but told Reuters he is still betting on a decline in Netflix shares. Despite the risks, however, some investors think the tech sector is still a great buy. Shawn Kravetz, president and chief investment officer of Esplanade Capital LLC and an investor in Apple Inc, concedes that the company has its own regulatory risks. "It's close to a trillion-dollar market cap company. That attracts attention," he said. But Kravetz said it may avoid the risk of other companies because of its different business model from other technology giants whose "business is monetizing you."

Prominent managers loaded up on Apple before recent tumble
 By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and David Randall NEW YORK, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Several prominent investors put fresh money to work in Apple  during the third quarter even as they sold out of other high-flying tech companies, betting the iPhone maker's stock would keep rising as strong growth overshadowed rising trade tensions between the United States and China. The purchases, which were revealed in securities filings on Wednesday, may be leaving large investors with steep losses if Apple continues its more than 15 percent decline for the month so far.  Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management made a big bet by raising his exposure by 938 percent to 884,321 shares while Chase Coleman'sTiger Global Management put on a new position to own just over 1 million shares. Despite the steep declines in Apple, some hedge fund managers said that they are continuing to add to shares in the company. "We know it is not a Facebook or a Google with eye-popping growth but we're not paying for that," said Shawn Kravetz, founder of Esplanade Capital, at the Reuters Global Investment 2019 Outlook Summit in New York on Wednesday. Kravetz, who added to his Apple position Wednesday morning, said investors like himself are attracted to the company's compelling valuation compared to other Silicon Valley giants.  The declines in Apple may add to what is proving to be another difficult year for the hedge fund industry. Overall, the average hedge fund dropped nearly 3 percent in October, the worst monthly loss since 2011, in large part due to over-exposures to the technology industry, according to Hedge Fund Research. Given the increased volatility in the U.S. stock market, defensive-minded funds will likely post the strongest returns through the end of the calendar year, said Kenneth Heinz, president of HFR. "Anticipating the market volatility which began in September and accelerated in October will continue into 2019, strategies positioned for this transitional market environment are likely to lead performance through year end," he said. Quarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers' stock holdings in 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are one of the few public ways of tracking what the managers are selling and buying. But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some risk because the disclosures are made 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions. The moves into the shares of Apple came at a time when several prominent hedge funds were starting to shed their holdings of the FANG stocks - Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc, and Google's parent Alphabet Inc  - that had led the market higher over the last two years. Jana Partners, for instance, sold all of its approximately 651,000 shares of Facebook and all of its approximately 44,000 shares of Alphabet Inc in the third quarter, according to securities filings. Third Point LLC sold all of its approximately 3 million shares of Facebook, a position which had made up about 4 percent of its prior portfolio. Los Angeles-based asset manager TCW Group Inc sold all of its approximately 127,000 shares of Netflix during the same time period.

 By Jonathan Stempel Nov 14 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett'sBerkshire Hathaway Inc  deepened its commitment to the U.S. financial industry, announcing a $4.02 billion stake in JPMorgan Chase & Co  and new investments in PNC Financial Services Group Inc  and Travelers Companies Inc, plus a stake in Oracle Corp. The investments were disclosed in a Wednesday regulatory filing detailing Berkshire's U.S.-listed stocks as of Sept. 30, following a quarter when the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate spent $17.7 billion on equities. It also added to its sizable stakes in two earlier Buffett investments, Bank of America Corp  and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. "While nervous investors fear the end of the economic recovery, Mr. Buffett is buying economically sensitive bank stocks," said Bill Smead, who runs Smead Capital Management Inc in Seattle and owns Berkshire stock. "It makes owners like us not mind sitting through a correction with them." Though the filing did not say which individual purchases Buffett or his investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler were responsible for, investors watch Berkshire's quarterly stock listings for signs about where the trio sees value. Shares of JPMorgan, PNC and Travelers each rose at least 1 percent in after-hours trading following Berkshire's disclosure of its new stakes, while Oracle shares rose 2.4 percent. JPMorgan and Travelers declined to comment. PNC, Oracle and Buffett's assistant did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The investment in JPMorgan, where Combs is a board member, closes a notable hole in Berkshire's portfolio. Berkshire had already been the largest investor in several companies, including American Express Co, Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon Corp, US Bancorp  and Wells Fargo & Co, according to Refinitiv data. Buffett has long praised the leadership of JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, and over the last year partnered with him and Amazon.com Inc  Chief Executive Jeff Bezos to create a new company aiming to cut U.S. employee healthcare costs. Atul Gawande, a surgeon and critic of medical industry practices, was named in June to lead the venture.  Buffett and Dimon also teamed up in June to call on companies to stop giving quarterly earnings forecasts, because they encourage an unhealthy focus on short-term profit at the expense of sustainable long-term growth. Berkshire has more than 90 businesses in the insurance, energy, food and retail, industrial, railroad and other sectors. Buffett, however, has not made a major acquisition since buying aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts in January 2016. He often buys stocks such as Apple Inc, in which Berkshire previously disclosed a $57.6 billion stake, when buying whole companies appears too expensive. Berkshire also spent $928 million repurchasing its own stock in the quarter.  Despite the stock purchases, Berkshire ended September with $103.6 billion of cash and equivalents. Berkshire also reported other portfolio changes, including the shedding of holdings in Walmart Inc  and French drugmaker Sanofi SA  and reduction in its stake in oil refiner Phillips 66. 
 
  (RTTNews.com) - Stocks fluctuated wildly over the course of the trading session on Wednesday after failing to sustain an initial move to the downside. The major averages pulled back firmly into negative territory in morning trading before staging an unsuccessful recovery attempt in the afternoon. By the close of trading, the major averages were significantly lower once again. The Dow fell 205.99 points or 0.8 percent to 25,080.50, the Nasdaq tumbled 64.48 points or 0.9 percent to 7,136.39 and the S&P 500 slid 20.60 points or 0.8 percent to 2,701.58. A continued decline by shares of Apple ( AAPL ) weighed on stocks on Wall Street, with the tech giant slumping by 2.8 percent to a four-month closing low. Apple extended a recent downtrend after Guggenheim Partners downgraded its rating on the company's stock to Neutral from Buy amid expectations of a 5 percent drop in iPhone units sold in 2019. Negative sentiment may also have been generated by comments by Congresswoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who is expected to take over the powerful House Financial Services Committee in the next Congress. Ahead of testimony by Federal Reserve Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles, Waters suggested she would halt President Donald Trump's efforts to roll back banking regulations. "Make no mistake, come January, in this committee the days of this committee weakening regulations and putting our economy once again at risk of another financial crisis will come to an end," Waters said. Meanwhile, traders largely shrugged off a report from the Labor Department showing consumer prices increased in line with economist estimates in the month of October. The Labor Department said its consumer price index rose by 0.3 percent in October after inching up by 0.1 percent in September. Economists had expected prices to climb by 0.3 percent. Excluding food and energy prices, core consumer prices edged up by 0.2 percent in October after creeping up by 0.1 percent in September. The uptick in core prices also matched expectations. The annual rate of consumer price growth accelerated to 2.5 percent in October from 2.3 percent in September, while the annual rate of core consumer price growth slowed to 2.1 percent from 2.2 percent. Sector News Biotechnology stocks moved sharply lower over the course of the trading day, extending the steep decline seen over the past several sessions. Reflecting the weakness in the biotech sector, the NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index tumbled by 2.2 percent to its lowest closing level in seven months. Significant weakness also emerged among utilities stocks, as reflected by the 1.5 percent slump by the Dow Jones Utilities Average. Financial, retail, software, and natural gas stocks also saw considerable weakness, moving lower along with most of the other major sectors. Meanwhile, gold stocks bucked the downtrend on the day, resulting in a 3.6 percent spike by the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index. The index bounced off a two-month closing low. The rebound by gold stocks came amid an increase by the price of the precious metal, with gold for December delivery climbing $8.70 to $1,207.90 an ounce. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly lower on Wednesday, although Japan'sNikkei 225 Index bucked the downtrend and edged up by 0.2 percent. China's Shanghai Composite Index slid by 0.9 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped by 0.5 percent. The major European markets also moved to the downside over the course of the session. While the U.K.'sFTSE 100 Index dipped by 0.3 percent, the German DAX Index and the French CAC 40 Index slid by 0.5 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively. In the bond market, treasuries moved higher over the course of the session after seeing initial weakness. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, dropped by 2.5 basis points to 3.120 percent. Looking Ahead Trading on Thursday may be impacted by reaction to a slew of U.S. economic news, including reports on retail sales, weekly jobless claims, regional manufacturing activity, and import and export prices. On the earnings front, networking giant Cisco Systems (CSCO) is among the companies releasing their quarterly results after the close of today's trading. Retail giant Walmart (WMT) is also among the companies due to report their results before the start of trading on Thursday. For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com 
 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, Nov 14 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields fell on Wednesday, as investors fretted about renewed weakness on Wall Street, which could signal much deeper problems in the world's largest economy. U.S. 30-year, 10-year, and two-year yields dropped to two-week lows. But the direction has since changed, as U.S. stock indexes fell, with Apple Inc  leading a decline in technology stocks. The S&P 500 index  also dropped for a fifth session in a row, led by financials.  "There is more thought that maybe there is something more to the stock market's weakness, that maybe it's starting to signal something about the economy, rather than just it being about trading or moving positions around," said Lou Brien, market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago. In afternoon trading, benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields fell to 3.117 percent, from 3.145 percent late on Tuesday. Ten-year yields earlier dropped to a two-week low of 3.092 percent. "U.S. Treasury yields are finally breaking lower to reflect distress in other markets that started Monday," said Jim Vogel, interest rates strategist at FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee. "The build-up of two-way flows at 3.155 percent on 10s forced today's buyers to crack the 3.13 percent barrier that immediately gave way to 3.125 percent to rebalance technicals," he added. U.S. 30-year yields slipped to 3.350 percent, after earlier sliding to a two-week trough of 3.334 percent,  compared with Tuesday's 3.367 percent. On the short end, U.S. two-year yields <US2YT=RR> fell to a two-week low of 2.837 percent, down from 2.895 percent on Tuesday. Two-year yields were last at 2.862 percent. Yields earlier gained some support from in-line U.S. core inflation data for October, which should keep the Federal Reserve firmly on track to raise interest rates next month and a few more times in 2019. Data showed on Wednesday that the U.S. consumer price index rose 0.3 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in September. October's rise was the largest in nine months amid gains in the cost of gasoline and rents. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, CPI climbed 0.2 percent, after the so-called core CPI had gained 0.1 percent for two straight months.  Andrew Hunter, U.S. economist at Capital Economics in London, said despite the rise in prices, the rest of the CPI report "supports our view that underlying inflation is unlikely to rise much further." Hunter noted that the Fed will still likely continue hiking rates once a quarter in the near term, with the next move coming in December, but Fed officials won't hesitate to back away from further tightening if economic growth slows.

Why Alibaba Stock Still Has Plenty of Better Days Ahead
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLast weekend,  Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) raked in over $30 billion in sales in just one day. While this sounds impressive, it still wasn't enough to impress BABA stock investors. Although this year's single day event beat last year's numbers, Wall Street was still disappointed, so the stock fell on the news.Beyond this recent drop, 2018 has been a generally tough year for Alibaba stock: In fact, it is down 20% year-to-date. This is partly because of the trade war with China, but not entirely. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF (NYSEARCA: FXI ) is only down 13% for the same period, so even compared to that, BABA stock still lags.This alone is not a reason to throw away Alibaba stock. There still is opportunity in it, especially if you're already long the stock. So is it time to sell BABA? The answer is no, not here.To be a successful trader, you need to know where a stock is headed, so it is important to almost ignore where it came from. Even though BABA stock has had a tough 2018, over two years it's up more than 50%. So it's not Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) performance, but it clearly outperforms the market.Fundamentally, Alibaba's price-to-earnings ratio is at 44, which may seem cheap relative to a company like Amazon, but it's more expensive than Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and it's almost twice as expensive as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). So there still might be froth to shed even after all the year-to-date pain.But the technicals say that maybe we should wait before selling Alibaba stock at these levels; 2017 was a banner year for BABA stock. It had a few pivot points that were big price resets. And they created a band of support that is still below the stock.Recently, Wall Street successfully tested them for the first time. So for the time being, the bulls are willing to hold above them. These areas of contention create congestion thereby becoming forward support.So from here, this should be solid footing for Alibaba stock to remount an effort for a rebound. But it will need the entire market's help, meaning if the stock market correction continues then the stock could retest $125 per share or lower.But even then, I still won't panic out of BABA stock.So if I haven't sold the stock yet, it's probably too late to sell it here. Conversely, if I'm thinking of shorting the stock, I would delay that decision for at least a few days to see how this consolidation zone develops.The macroeconomic environment is still favorable to the bull thesis, but we have three egos that are in charge of the global markets. President Trump of the U.S. and President XI of China need to come to their senses before they destroy the global economy. They have the opportunity to do it in a few weeks and cooler heads should prevail. There is too much to lose for both sides.In addition, there are worries that the U.S. Federal Reserve may tighten rates too far and too fast thereby causing an economic slowdown in the U.S. that could be contagious. Chairman Jerome Powell needs to let investors know that he is not intent on doing this on purpose. Wall Street misses the soothing words that Yellen used: The Fed action plan is data-dependent. So far, Powell has refused to state this.The bottom line for Alibaba stock is that there has been pain in 2018, but nothing goes up in a straight line. Over the last few years, this BABA has still been a winner. So unless I am day trading, I won't be quick to throw that stock away yet. Management has proved it can deliver on its promises so it deserves the benefit of the doubt a little longer.Wall Street experts agree, since they all have it as a BUY and yet it still trades well below their lowest price targets. But the longer it trades below their potential, the higher the odds of some of them resetting their expectations lower. Such headlines tend to have a negative effect on stock prices, but it will be short term.Click  here  for more of my market thesis and get an ongoing free copy of my weekly newsletters.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of  SellSpreads.com .

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt has been a rotten stretch for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) bulls the past few weeks, but gravity may finally be losing its grip on shares. Still, investors looking to nibble should be prepared - picking up AAPL stock may be a little messy before slightly more fertile ground for a bullish cycle is found. Let me explain.Blame it on what you will. And if you're an Apple stock die-hard, there's a lot to point fingers at. From broad-based market weakness to recent weak sales guidance for Q4 and more immediate bearish hints from the supply chain this week, the world's largest company may be human after all. It has been a tough, but far from lonely, stretch for AAPL.If misery loves company, AAPL stock's 17% correction is even a bit more rotten than the Nasdaq 100's 14% decline over the past several weeks. But something other than hope may be entering the technical picture, so that an Apple comes up smelling like roses for bullish investors.It wasn't long ago - in fact, just about two weeks on the calendar - that I was bearish on AAPL stock in front of earnings. The concern wasn't the fundamentals or consumer trends, though I'll admit I've yet to see one person whip out the iPhone X and that's a bit alarming.More to the point, the worry was technical in nature based on Apple's price chart. Apple had formed a head and shoulders topping pattern after jumping aggressively above multiyear channel line resistance. Fast forward and gravity did take hold of Apple and shares have broken decisively lower. But now the stronger technical opportunity lays with bullish investors.A previously discussed measured move out of the pattern is for all intents and purposes now being full-filled. The pattern completion also lines up fairly well with a key challenge of 200-day simple moving average support, a test of the 50% support level from 2018's low to high, as well as a fill of a bullish earnings price gap from last quarter.All told, Apple shares are looking a lot more attractive from a value perspective on the price chart than they were a short time ago. That's not to say there's no risk in buying AAPL stock. It would arrogant to suggest otherwise. Still, the opportunity for shares to bottom nearby look good.If I was to put a price tag on where AAPL can bottom, I'd estimate a 7.5% wide zone from $178-$192 as a key area of longer-term support. Aside from the fore-mentioned supports this area holds the 62% retracement level, as well as Apple's multi-year channel line.For Apple stock investors agreeable with what's been discussed and wish to buy shares, I'd wait for a two candle reversal bottoming pattern to emerge as stochastics aren't entirely supportive just yet.On the other hand, if shares do press lower and conditions become more oversold, then buying AAPL shares into weakness and deeper in the support zone with a stop-loss below $178, looks interesting.Alternatively and for like-minded options traders, an Apple stock modified fence strategy buying the March $205/$215 bull call spread and selling the March $180/$175 put spread for a debit of $1.50 is a favored strategy to control risk while offering the potential for outsized profits in a slightly more optimistic market.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

 The mobile payments market is causing a seismic shift in how   people manage money, and it appears to be a ripe corner of the   market where investors could make life-changing gains in the   decades to come. It's expected to grow 34% annually through 2023,   and several major technology and financial companies are vying   for position.   PayPal Holdings    (NASDAQ: PYPL) certainly looks well positioned following a string   of   partnership announcements     with banks and credit-card companies. The stock price has   soared 130% over the last three years following stellar   financial performance.We'll review the company's recent performance, valuation, and   strategy to determine whether now is a good time to jump on board   this fast-growing digital payment leader.  IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.The first thing that may give investors pause when considering   buying shares of PayPal is the stock's high valuation. The stock   has a nose-bleed   trailing P/E    of 48. However, the multiple drops considerably as we   consider the company's expected growth.The P/E drops to 35 based on management's 2018 guidance for   non-GAAP earnings per share. The shares trade for 29 times   the consensus analyst estimate for 2019 adjusted earnings.It's almost a given that a consistent, high-growth company is   going to trade for a high P/E ratio. The   S&P 500    index includes some of the best companies in the world and trades   for a trailing P/E of 22.3 and a forward P/E of   16.8. Analysts expect the average company in the index to   grow earnings 11% per year over the next five years. So, it   makes sense that a company that can grow much faster deserves a   higher multiple than the S&P 500 as a whole.PayPal is putting up some big numbers that make it worthy of   its premium valuation. The company just posted another impressive   quarter of 26% year-over-year growth in adjusted earnings per   share, fueled by 27% growth in the total number of transactions   over its platform and 24% growth in total payment   volume. Analysts expect the company to grow earnings 20%   annually over the next five years, consistent with its   recent growth.The digital payments leader has been posting these high growth   rates consistently for a long time. Investors are willing to   pay up for the shares because they see mobile payments playing a   big role in commerce over time, and they are confident PayPal can   keep posting these high growth rates going forward.Of course, PayPal is not the only company vying for position   in this booming market. It faces competition from major tech   companies, including digital payment services provided by   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) (Apple Pay),   Samsung Electronics    (Samsung Pay), and   Alphabet     (Android Pay).PayPal also faces competition from big banks that may feel   threatened by a digital economy and the fast growth of   peer-to-peer (P2P) payment services, such as   PayPal's Venmo app    . Venmo is on pace to generate $70 billion in annual payment   volume as it becomes a go-to source of funds in the daily lives   of its users. Banks have offered their own P2P service   called Zelle to counter apps like Venmo.While PayPal is growing at a fast pace, Zelle has delivered   strong results for the major banks, including   Bank of America    ,   Capital One Financial    , and   Wells Fargo    . Transaction volume across the Zelle network increased 83%   to reach $106 billion in total payment volume over the last   year.Apple Pay just tripled its payment transactions year over year   to 1 billion in Apple's last quarter. Last year, Apple   launched its own P2P service called Apple Pay Cash. The   iPhone maker has 1.3 billion active devices around the world (as   of the fiscal first quarter 2018), which has helped it   quickly catch up to PayPal's customer reach. One analyst   estimated the number of users on Apple Pay to be 253   million; right in line with PayPal's 254 million.Even with all of this competition, PayPal seems to only be   getting stronger. Its customer base grew 15% year over year in   the third quarter, which is an acceleration over the year-ago   quarter's 13% growth rate.In addition, PayPal's customers continue to use their accounts   more and more frequently    . Over the last year, customers have used their accounts an   average of 0.7 times per week; that's up 9% year over year,   representing a slight acceleration over the year-ago quarter's 8%   increase.PayPal's recent performance clearly shows it's not going   anywhere. Apple Pay, Zelle, and other digital payment providers   will grab their pieces of the pie. But remember, the global   mobile payments market is expected to reach a massive $4.6   trillion in the next five years, according to Allied Market   Research. No single company is going to be able to grab all of   that.PayPal is as well positioned as any company to benefit from   e-commerce, which makes the stock a buy in my book.  10 stocks we like better than PayPal Holdings       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

 By David Randall NEW YORK, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Strong U.S. consumer holiday spending will not boost retailers across the board but instead benefit winners like Apple Inc  that have signature products, Esplanade Capital'sShawn Kravetz said at the Reuters Global Investment 2019 Outlook Summit in New York on Wednesday. Shares of the iPhone maker slipped 3 percent in midday trading Wednesday, sending them down more than 20 percent from their recent highs and into a bear market. "We know it is not a Facebook or a Google with eye-popping growth but we're not paying for that," Kravetz said, referring to Apple's 15.8 price to earnings multiple. At the same time, Apple is less likely to come under regulatory scrutiny into the use of data as some other Silicon Valley giants, he said. "It wouldn't shock me to see its peers go down another 20 percent while Apple rallies," he said. Along with Apple, Kravetz said that he has been adding to his positions in casino stocks. He believes the sell-off that has pushed down share prices in the sector by approximately a third this year is an overdone reaction to concerns about growth in China and other emerging markets. His fund has added to its positions in Caesars Entertainment Corp, casino video game maker International Game Technology PLC  and Penn National Gaming Inc  this year, he said, in part because of steep declines that he called "an absolute gift." "We don't think casinos will be a canary in a coal mine" that signal a coming recession, he said. Instead, "We think we will see more M&A as the leaders try to get bigger and try to consolidate some of their power," he said. Kravetz said that strong consumer spending, boosted in part by low unemployment rates and rising wages, will not translate into widespread gains across retailers due to rising costs as companies try to keep up with the fast, free shipping pioneered by Amazon.com Inc. Off-price retailers such as Burlington Stores Inc, TJX Companies Inc  and Ross Stores Inc  could be one casualty of shoppers becoming more sophisticated at finding deals at a time when each company has announced expansion plans, he said. "They've been the place to hide through thick and thin for a decade. But now all three are growing aggressively or trying to, which makes life harder when you have three big players trying to grow meaningfully," he said. "They are looking more like the department stores and the department stores are looking more like them." 
 
  Lumentum    's (NASDAQ: LITE) stock plunged 33% on Nov. 12 after the fiber   optic component maker announced that one of its top industrial   and consumer customers -- widely presumed to be   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) -- requested a material reduction in shipments of   laser diodes for 3D sensing technologies.The announcement also caused shares of Apple,   which cancelled    a production boost for the lower-end iPhone XR in early   November, to slide 5%. Shares of   Oclaro    (NASDAQ: OCLR) , which Lumentum is in the process of acquiring,   dropped 12%.  Image source: Getty Images.Lumentum slashed its guidance for the second quarter to   reflect the change, which was abrupt since the company had just   reported its first quarter earnings on Nov. 1. But did   investors overreact by knocking the stock down to a fresh 52-week   low?Before we review Lumentum's updated guidance, we should   examine its revenue and earnings growth over the past four   quarters.Q2 2018Q3 2018Q4 2018Q1 2019Revenue52.7%16.8%35.2%45.6%EPS288.4%59.2%143.6%204.7%YOY growth, non-GAAP. Source: Lumentum quarterly reports.Lumentum's growth accelerated over the past two quarters on   robust demand for telecom and fiber laser products, rebounding   demand in China, and the expansion of 3D sensing technologies   across multiple customers. It also benefited from easy   comparisons to the previous year, which saw cyclically soft   demand for fiber optic components.Last quarter, 88% of Lumentum's revenue came from its core   optical communications products, and the remaining 12% came from   its laser components. Its optical revenues rose 49% annually, and   its laser revenues grew 25%.Most of the laser unit's growth came from the industrial and   consumer segment, which posted 154% annual sales growth during   the quarter. That growth was tempered by the slower growth of the   much larger commercial laser segment.Lumentum investors likely hoped that stronger demand for 3D   sensing laser diodes would boost the unit's overall growth.   Unfortunately, the updated guidance indicates that those plans   won't pan out:Q2 2019Original guidanceRevised guidanceRevenue0% to 6%(12%) to (17%)EPS(4%) to 5%(20%) to (31%)YOY growth, non-GAAP. Source: Lumentum press release.Lumentum originally expected its non-GAAP operating margin to   hit 28%-30% during the second quarter, up from 23.9% in the first   quarter. However, it now expects that figure to stay roughly flat   sequentially at 23% to 25%.Investors likely abandoned Lumentum for three simple reasons.   First, the loss of a major customer will cause analysts to lower   their guidance across the board. Second, fiber stocks are highly   cyclical, and investors didn't want to get caught in a downturn   -- especially in a weak market. Lastly, nervous investors were   already looking for reasons to sell amid the broader sell-off of   tech stocks.However, Lumentum's sell-off also reduced its forward P/E to   about 7. Granted, that multiple will likely rise as analysts cut   their estimates, but that ratio could remain in the single digits   even if Lumentum loses a fifth of its earnings.Investors should also remember that Lumentum has other irons   in the fire. Lumentum expects its   acquisition of Oclaro    to become accretive to its non-GAAP earnings "immediately" after   closing, generate over $60 million in run-rate synergies   within 12 to 24 months, and broaden its R&D capabilities and   product portfolio.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's not a good time to be a young newly-traded tech company. Despite a Q3 earnings report that in many ways exceeded expectations, investors have pushed  Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU ) stock into free fall. Since the beginning of October, ROKU stock has lost about 45% of its value. That's a decline from over $70 to just $43 now.To be fair, ROKU was trading in the thirties this past summer; the recent losses have largely just reversed previous gains.That said, it's still an incredible decline for ROKU especially given that the business' momentum remains strong. Bears and bulls will make the same points they have done previously.To the bears, ROKU stock is too expensive given the strong competitive risks to the franchise. Bulls will say that as long as the company keeps growing quickly, it will grow into its valuation and possibly a return to $70/share in the cards.Which side has the better argument? At least at this share price, the evidence favors the bulls. Here's why.Roku recently announced its latest earnings. From the headlines, you'd have expected the stock to surge. The company only lost nine cents per share, well ahead of the 12 cent consensus forecast.On revenues, it beat expectations by several percent. Additionally, the company raised guidance for both its revenue growth and profit margins. Despite the abundance of good news, ROKU stock instead plunged 10% immediately following the report.What's going on here? For one, there were a couple minor nitpicks with the earnings report. This quarter, for example, Average Revenue Per User grew at a more modest 4% rate.That compares to Roku's traditional 10% or more growth rate in ARPU. This could be a limitation of Roku's advertising model, or simply that the company has already found the lowest-hanging fruit in terms of sales opportunities.The other issue is that while Roku topped estimates, some people had been hoping for even more. These weren't blowout results, though they were very impressive. But Roku had the misfortune of releasing its earnings report during the worst meltdown in FAANG stocks in years. Investors have shellacked tech companies coming up short of expectations this earnings cycle.Facing the challenge of huge expectations and dismal market sentiment, ROKU stock was vulnerable to panic selling.Bears will argue that Roku's slowing ARPU rate is a sign of problems to come, and to be fair, they could be right. But it's important to remember that Roku's overall user growth rates continue to hum along as they have done in this past.In an ideal world, Roku would be able to achieve a further surge in average revenue per user. But they're still achieving economies of scale by expanding their overall audience and monetizing it reasonably well at the same time.Like  Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), no one should be buying ROKU stock today in the hopes of huge near-term earnings. Roku is building its brand and user base for the future and this quarter gave no indication that the thesis has deteriorated.Roku should reach the $1 billion annual sales mark in around a year. That puts ROKU stock at 7x price/sales today, and under 5x forward price/sales.Netflix often has traded at or above 10x in recent times, and is still at 9x now after its own big correction. Other fast-growing social tech companies also tend to fetch price/sales ratios far above the 5-7x range that ROKU will be at in 2019.I'd argue the most important takeaway from the recent earnings report is that the user base is still growing rapidly. The CEO, Anthony Wood, noted on the conference call that there is still a great deal of upside coming in user accounts going forward.As the company comes pre-loaded on roughly one in five Smart TVs, it is well-positioned to maintain its market share even as Roku transitions from making hardware to native operating systems.That said, I've said it before and it's still true: lots of large tech companies know how to make native user interfaces. Big TV makers such as  Samsung (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) could easily build their own products. And Roku should expect to face stiff competition from the likes of  Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and  Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ).Roku got a big lead in what was initially a niche hardware market. With smart TVs now mainstream, Roku will have to work much harder to maintain its ecosystem lead. And it will do so against strong well-funded competitors.Ultimately, the bears have some fair points. I'm not convinced that ROKU stock will be a compelling buy and hold story. There are many ways it could fail to end up being the next Netflix or other hot growth company.But in the short-term, the company is executing beautifully. Once market conditions improve, expect it to get some much-deserved recognition.As the CEO said, they've now beaten expectations all five quarters since becoming a public company. And with the company's newer video ad format doing well, it's not hard to imagine ARPU growth picking back up either. Keep ROKU stock on a short leash, but for now, the next move should be solidly to the upside.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek held no positions in the aforementioned securities.

For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL -November 14, 2018 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: AppleAAPL ,  Diodes Inc.DIOD , Himax TechnologiesHIMX , ACM ResearchACMR and Park City GroupPCYG .Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog:Apple Shares Down 5% -- Now What?Bad news coming out of Apple's supply chain has driven some investors to panic, sending shares swooning.Specifically, Lumentum, which makes Face ID technology for its latest generation of iPhones, slashed its adjusted EPS guidance range to $1.15 - $1.34 (previous $1.60 - $1.75) and its revenue outlook to $335 million - $355 million (previous $405 million - $430 million) citing notably softer demand at a key customer (this could be Apple, since the iPhone maker accounted for 30% of its annual revenue).Suppliers Japan Display and British chipmaker IQE also pulled down estimates citing weaker smartphone demand.This followed reports from Japanese daily Nikkei that suppliers Foxconn and Pegatron were halting plans to further expand production lines related to the cheapest of this year's lineup, the XR.Analysts turned negative following Apple's announcement that it would no longer provide details about the number of devices it sells, or even how that breaks down between iPhones, iPads, Macs, etc."The lack of transparency is disappointing, and will likely limit investor's visibility into the company," said BMO Capital's Tim Long. "Our view remains that units may not grow at all going forward, and while average selling prices (ASPs) are still increasing, at some point they will plateau."So first, it was Apple's announcement that it would no longer provide certain numbers, then it was the covering analysts voicing their misgivings, and finally, it's Apple suppliers taking down their forecasts.While things don't look good at this point, the situation was expected. What remains unknown is the extent of damage to Apple, how it will tell on its revenue and profits, how much of it was planned by the company and how much damage control it has up its sleeve.We won't know the impact on the numbers until the next earnings announcement and we already know that the softness is largely driven by saturation in developed markets, weak demand for very high end devices in developing markets (like India), longer replacement cycles and the stronger dollar that makes Apple products more expensive internationally. But it also makes sense to revisit what Apple has knowingly done to boost its services business at the cost of its hardware business.So consider the iOS 12, which for the first time, supports 28 devices, including models that launched way back in 2013. This will allow the camera to launch 70% faster and make the keyboard 50% faster, likely supporting the services Apple badly wants the user to avail.The feeling that Apple is now helping users to hang on to their devices longer may also encourage some to try a more expensive device sometime in the future. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi estimates that this move could extend iPhone replacement cycles by six months to 3.2 years and push unit sales down by 6% percent a year for three years.Second, earlier this year, Apple agreed to pay for battery replacement of older iPhones when they were slowing down, a cost they incurred for the sake of loyalty, so older iPhone users remained in the Apple ecosystem with no need to upgrade.How much of this Apple will make up with increased service revenue is of course unclear, at least in the near to midterm. But its services prospects are bright and the company is also seeing momentum there.RecommendationBecause of the increased uncertainty, it's probably a better idea wait for the share price to stabilize before taking any further action. So Apple shares currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Buy-ranked tech stocks worth considering instead would be Diodes Inc., Himax Technologies, ACM Research and Park City Group. But since isn't the best time to invest in tech given the market's concerns about its over valuation, you can also take a look at the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

 By Sruthi Shankar Nov 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 dropping for the fifth session in a row, as Apple Inc  continued to lead a retreat in technology stocks and financials were hit by fears that sector-wide regulations would no longer be eased. Mounting concerns that iPhone sales have hit a wall pushed Apple shares lower for the fifth day in a row. At their session low, shares were down more than 20 percent from its record high.  Apple's 2.7 percent drop led the heavyweight technology index  down 1.25 percent. Those losses were only outdone by a 1.88 percent-drop in financial stocks. Banks fell after Democrat Maxine Waters, poised to become chair of the U.S. House banking committee, said regulations would not be eased any further on her watch, according to a CNBC report. "When Waters came up that had a profound impact on the markets and right about the time the S&P went negative," said Forrest. The market started on a buoyant note as oil prices rebounded and data showed consumer prices rose only as much as expected last month, easing fears of overheating inflation and faster interest rate hikes.  But that soon petered out, with traders saying that cautious investors were looking to sell any pockets of strength in the market. "Overall market sentiment continues to be extremely cautious. When the market gapped up you saw sellers dig in to take advantage of better prices, but there was no real support in the first 30-60 minutes," said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. "It just became a self-fulfilling prophecy that the market was going to trend lower." At 13:12 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was down 222.30 points, or 0.88 percent, at 25,064.19, the S&P 500  was down 23.52 points, or 0.86 percent, at 2,698.66 and the Nasdaq Composite  was down 66.62 points, or 0.93 percent, at 7,134.25. Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co  and insurer Travelers Cos Inc  fell between 2.0 percent and 2.7 percent to join Apple among the top decliners on the Dow. Energy stocks  gave up earlier gains to trade down 0.3 percent, though oil prices were higher.  PG&E Corp  slumped 24.1 percent after the utility warned it could face "significant liability" in excess of its insurance coverage if its equipment was found to have caused the blaze raging in Northern California.  Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.42-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.72-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P recorded 12 new 52-week highs and 13 new lows. The Nasdaq recorded 12 new highs and 149 new lows.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe market tried to turn Monday's drubbing around on Tuesday. But, when push came to shove, it was the bears doing most of the shoving. The S&P 500 closed at 2722.18 yesterday, down 0.15%, led lower by Amarin Corporation (NASDAQ: AMRN ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Amarin fell more than 22% in response to a concerning update on one of its key drug trials .Curiously though, there was more bullish volume on Tuesday than bearish volume, and only a few more falling stocks than rising stocks. General Electric (NYSE: GE ) was up nearly 8% as investors went bargain shopping following Monday's continued meltdown.None of those tickers are particularly well positioned as good trading setups headed into hump-day though. Rather, it's stock charts of HollyFrontier (NYSE: HFC ), PPL (NYSE: PPL ) and Home Depot (NYSE: HD ) that hold the most promise, as they've all formed some familiar setups.It has probably got more to do with the brewing weakness with the whole energy sector than with HollyFrontier in particular. But, the reason is irrelevant.What matters most is what's happening, and the fact that HFC shares are just one more stumble away from getting into a "bad to worse" situation.
 Click to Enlarge  • The downtrend on both the weekly and daily stock charts speaks for itself. It has been well framed by falling resistance and support lines, plotted in yellow.• Though the lower edge of that bearish trading range was kissed on Tuesday, yesterday's weakness also pulled HFC under the critical 200-day moving average line, in white, for the second time in three weeks.• While the bulls will likely push back a bit, until HollyFrontier breaks all the way above a convergence of resistance all around $68, the threat of a break below $60.60 (give or take) is too significant to ignore.More than once within the past several weeks we've look at utility stock PPL, pointing out how well-grounded the budding rally was, and how close it was to a break above a pretty important technical ceiling.That happened in earnest last week, but it's what happened in the meantime that's so enticing. Without even blinking, the buyers kept wading into the stock. That move appears to be celebrating now, and there's a ton of room to keep rolling.
 Click to Enlarge • The resistance line in question is around $31.20, plotted with a blue dashed line, around where PPL peaked a couple of different times since September.• This is a well-grounded breakout thrust too, pushing up and off key moving average lines multiple times along the way. Those pushoffs are highlighted on the daily chart.• Zooming out to the weekly chart makes it clear there's no previous area of turbulence that's apt to stop a rally effort in its tracks.Last but not least, with just a quick glance it doesn't appear Home Depot did much of anything yesterday other than lose ground. Shares ended the day with a loss of 0.24%, and the bears were plentiful, judging from the volume.There were some oddities with Tuesday's trading action, however, that suggest the steep selloff and partial clawback is actually going to serve as a pivot point out of a downtrend and into an uptrend.
 Click to Enlarge  • The shape of the bar is the first big clue. The open and close are both relatively near the middle of a tall high/low range, but the close is above the open on a day volume surged. It appears Tuesday's action is marked by a flood of people getting out, followed by another flood of people plowing back in.• If this is indeed a reversal, it's the perfect place to make one. Last month's low is in line with the March low, and Tuesday's low was in line with last month's lowest close.• Nevertheless, this is a setup that requires confirmation in the form of bullish follow-through.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

One of the biggest tech industry stories of next year will likely be 5G—the next-gen of cellular technology that will redefine speed and responsiveness, making connections up to 100 times faster.Now, it’s a heated race to see which provider is going to roll out true 5G, fastest and farthest. Verizon promises to launch its 5G service next year, while AT&T has vowed to launch it this year in 12 markets, successfully testing it last month in Waco, Texas, and eyeing launch in 19 cities next year.But for investors, getting in on the 5G ‘revolution’ might require thinking outside the box and looking not just at the providers, but at the backbone of this technology.Case in point: Intel (INTC), which has just announced plans for its new XMM 8160 5G modem, set for release in the second half of 2019. Intel’s acceleration plans could make it the first tech company to actually power 5G iPhones (but the trick here is Android vs iPhone).So the race isn’t just about providers—it’s about the tech behind 5G and their race to secure market share.5G could be the thing that catapults Intel ahead of Qualcomm (QCOM), for instance, which has dominated the LTE market.Intel’s new modem will support the at the new 5G specs and still include support for 2G,3G and 4G.  "Intel's new XMM 8160 5G modem provides the ideal [hardware] to support large volumes for scaling across multiple device categories to coincide with broad 5G deployments," Dr. Cormac Conroy, Intel's corporate vice president and general manager of the firm's Communication and Devices Group, said in a statement.“We are seeing great demand for the advanced feature set of the XMM 8160, such that we made a strategic decision to pull in the launch of this modem by half a year to deliver a leading 5G [product]."But what’s got everyone’s attention is the fact that this new modem is being fast-tracked after Apple (AAPL) switched to exclusively using Intel modems for its 2018 iPhones. And rumor has it that Apple will stick to Intel when everything goes 5G, the Verge reports.  But the trick is in the timing. While Apple switched from Qualcomm to Intel earlier this year, going with Intel for 5G means waiting until 2020 to release the first 5G iPhone. Qualcomm already has it’s 5G modem out there, and if Apple went back to Qualcomm it could get a head start on 5G phones in 2019. Committing to Intel means waiting a bit longer. With Intel’s modem set for release in late 2019, then on to testing, the real roll-out would be 2020.And there are plenty of other companies to keep a close eye on in this space, too, including Samsung, Nokia, Sony, LG and Huawei—along with a host of others. And they joining forces with Qualcomm to get 5G smartphones on the market in late 2019.So, the race is on, and it’s nearing the finish line, with investors wondering whether Intel is the safe bet thanks to Apple, or whether Apple will bow to the pressure of timing. At the end of the day, this is another Android vs Apple race.By Michael Kern for Safehaven.com

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, Nov 14 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields reversed course and fell on Wednesday, as investors fretted that renewed weakness on Wall Street could be signaling much deeper problems in the world's largest economy. U.S. benchmark 10-year and two-year yields dropped to two-week troughs, while the 30-year yield hit the day's lows.  But the direction has since changed, as U.S. stock indexes fell, with Apple Inc  leading a decline in technology stocks.  "There is more thought that maybe there is something more to the stock market's weakness, that maybe it's starting to signal something about the economy, rather than just it being about trading or moving positions around," said Lou Brien, market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago.  "The long end, in particular, will be very much attuned to stock market movements," he added. In midday trading, benchmark 10-year note yields fell to 3.123 percent, from 3.145 percent late on Tuesday. Ten-year yields earlier dropped to a two-week low of 3.121 percent. U.S. 30-year yields slipped to 3.356 percent  compared with Tuesday's 3.367 percent. On the short end of the curve, U.S. two-year yields fell to a two-week low of 2.871 percent, down from 2.895 percent on Tuesday. Yields earlier gained some support from in-line U.S. core inflation data for October, which should keep the Federal Reserve firmly on track to raise interest rates next month and a few more times in 2019. Data showed on Wednesday that the U.S. consumer price index rose 0.3 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in September. October's rise was the largest in nine months amid gains in the cost of gasoline and rents. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, CPI climbed 0.2 percent. The so-called core CPI had gained 0.1 percent for two straight months.  Andrew Hunter, U.S. economist at Capital Economics in London, said the rebound in headline CPI was mostly driven by a rise in gasoline prices, which will be more than reversed over the next couple of months with the decline in oil prices. "The rest of the report supports our view that underlying inflation is unlikely to rise much further from here," he added. That said, Hunter noted that the Fed will still likely continue hiking interest rates once a quarter in the near term, with the next move coming in December. "But with little sign that a more marked acceleration in inflation lies ahead, Fed officials won't hesitate to back away from further tightening if economic growth slows."

 By Sruthi Shankar Nov 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks turned lower on Wednesday as Apple Inc  led a decline in technology stocks, offsetting early support from  tame U.S. consumer prices data and a rebound in oil prices. The iPhone maker's shares fell 2 percent, extending its losses for the fifth straight day. A raft of profit warnings from Apple's suppliers has fueled investor concerns that iPhone sales, in terms of volume, have hit a wall.  Markets earlier got a boost from data that showed U.S. consumer prices increased 0.3 percent in October amid a rise in gasoline and rental costs, but were in line with expectations.  The S&P energy index  which had risen in morning trade on a rebound in oil prices, following a 7 percent plunge on Tuesday, also gave up gains. "The markets never really left correction mode and it will be with us for a while, at least till the selling into strengths keeps happening," said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W.

  (RTTNews.com) - After failing to sustain an initial move to the upside, stocks have come under pressure over the course of the trading session on Wednesday. The major averages have pulled back well off their highs of the session and into negative territory. In recent trading, the major averages have climbed off their lows of the session but remain in the red. The Dow is down 76.61 points or 0.3 percent at 25,209.88, the Nasdaq is down 20.99 points or 0.3 percent at 7,179.89 and the S&P 500 is down 6.61 points or 0.2 percent at 2,715.57. A continued decline by shares of Apple ( AAPL ) is weighing on the markets, with the tech giant slumping by 1.8 percent to a four-month intraday low. Apple is extending a recent downtrend after Guggenheim Partners downgraded its rating on the company's stock to Neutral from Buy amid expectations of a 5 percent drop in iPhone units sold in 2019. Negative sentiment may also have been generated by comments by Congresswoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who is expected to take over the powerful House Financial Services Committee in the next Congress. Ahead of testimony by Federal Reserve Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles, Waters suggested she would halt President Donald Trump's efforts to roll back banking regulations. "Make no mistake, come January, in this committee the days of this committee weakening regulations and putting our economy once again at risk of another financial crisis will come to an end," Waters said. Meanwhile, traders have largely shrugged off a report from the Labor Department showing consumer prices increased in line with economist estimates in the month of October. The Labor Department said its consumer price index rose by 0.3 percent in October after inching up by 0.1 percent in September. Economists had expected prices to climb by 0.3 percent. Excluding food and energy prices, core consumer prices edged up by 0.2 percent in October after creeping up by 0.1 percent in September. The uptick in core prices also matched expectations. The annual rate of consumer price growth accelerated to 2.5 percent in October from 2.3 percent in September, while the annual rate of core consumer price growth slowed to 2.1 percent from 2.2 percent. Sector News Extending the downward trend seen over the past few sessions, biotechnology stocks have shown a significant drop on the day. Reflecting the considerable weakness in the biotechnology sector, the NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index has tumbled by 1.7 percent. Steel stocks have also come under pressure amid lingering concerns about global demand, dragging the NYSE Arca Steel Index down by 1.2 percent. Natural gas, utilities, and tobacco stocks have also shown notable moves to the downside, while gold stocks continue to see substantial strength amid a modest increase by the price of the precious metal. With gold for December delivery edging up $1.60 to $1,203 an ounce, the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index is up by 2.2 percent. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly lower on Wednesday, although Japan'sNikkei 225 Index bucked the downtrend and edged up by 0.2 percent. China's Shanghai Composite Index slid by 0.9 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped by 0.5 percent. The major European markets also moved to the downside over the course of the session. While the U.K.'sFTSE 100 Index dipped by 0.3 percent, the German DAX Index and the French CAC 40 Index slid by 0.5 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively. In the bond market, treasuries have moved modestly higher over the course of the session after seeing initial weakness. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is down by 1.1 basis points at 3.134 percent. For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com 
US STOCKS SNAPSHOT-Wall Street gives up early gains as Apple weighs
Wall Street gives up early gains as Apple weighs
 By Stephen Nellis SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 14 (Reuters) - A raft of profit warnings from Apple Inc  suppliers this week has fueled investor concerns that iPhone sales, in terms of volume, have hit a wall that could spell trouble for the company's plans to make services its main pillar of growth. Apple has often stated its plan to increase its revenue from paid services, such as Apple Music and iCloud. That, at least in part, requires a growing base of device owners driven by its  iPhone, which analysts believe accounts for about two-thirds of the 1.3 billion Apple devices in use around the world.  Without volume growth in promising overseas markets such as India, Brazil and Russia, the worry among analysts and investors is that Apple has at least parts of its strategy wrong with too much emphasis on its premium brand and the high prices that go with it, more than $1,000 for its top models. Hal Eddins, chief economist for Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel, said phones like the OnePlus 6T are roughly comparable to Apple's high-end phones for almost half the price. "You can get a lot of phone for a lot less," he said. "The phone landscape is rapidly changing and I think manufacturers are missing a trick by going the $1,000 route."  Apple declined to comment on its strategy, or the share moves among its suppliers.  The company's executives have warned investors in the past against fixating on sparse data points from its large supply chain. Apple has for more than a decade insisted that its gadgets should not be judged on their specs alone, an argument that sales data suggests Apple made successfully.  The company also has customer satisfaction and loyalty rates that are unparalleled in the mobile phone industry, said Ben Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies.  Nevertheless, a trio of Chinese smartphone makers - Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo - accounted for roughly a quarter of the global market in the first half of 2018, according to data from research firm IDC, up from just 8.9 percent for all of 2014 and almost 20 percent last year.  With the exception of fiscal 2015, Apple has not increased its market share. It had 13.6 percent of the world market in the first half of this year, down from 14.8 percent for 2014, although its share typically rises with full-year results due to strong sales in December. The 1.3 billion iPhones, iPads and Macs used around the world serves as the pool of potential customers for Apple's services - a business that hit $37.1 billion in revenue for the most recent fiscal year. That represented 14 percent of Apple's overall revenue, up from 8.5 percent in fiscal 2015 when iPhone unit sales hit their all-time high. But IDC expects the global smartphone market to grow only 2.4 percent on a compound basis to 1.6 billion units by 2022, indicating a saturated market in which the Cupertino, California-based firm will be fighting rivals for each customer. According to data from IDC, Xiaomi was the top smartphone seller in India in the first and second quarters of 2018, with 30.3 percent and 29.7 percent, respectively, of the market for smartphone units there.  "This is the case where it's much different in other parts of the world," said Ryan Reith, program vice president for IDC's mobile device tracking program, noting that most U.S. consumers are not familiar with Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo phones.  "Many of those brands don't play (in the United States), but they're playing in places where they never played before," such as India and Europe, he said.  
 SUPPLIERS SUFFER Underscoring flattening iPhone unit sales, it also said it sold 217.7 million iPhones in its most recent fiscal year, virtually unchanged from the year before and well below a high point of 231.2 million in fiscal 2015. Apple's newest models such as the iPhone XS and iPhone XR are proving popular with its most loyal fans in wealthy economies. But they range up to $1,449 in price - out of reach for many consumers in less developed markets. It has also  emphasized that its phones are designed to last longer than the competition, expanded its repair options and crafted its most recent operating system update to speed up older devices. But Chinese smartphone makers have been packing their phones with higher-end chips and features like under-the-glass fingerprint sensors that seek to attract consumers who might otherwise give Apple's phones a look. Those phones were initially sold in China but "we've also seen them gaining share outside China, especially in areas such as India and Europe," Amon said. On its home turf, too, Apple is facing new challenges from at least one Chinese maker, OnePlus, which is creeping in to the U.S. firm's traditionally high pricing territory. Though the iPhone 7's processor chip beats the OnePlus 6T in some speed tests posted by chip tracking firm Geekbench, the OnePlus phone has a contemporary design with thin bezels around the display, similar to newer iPhone models. At $549, it sits between the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 in terms of pricing. Kyle Kiang, the general manager for North America for OnePlus, said first-day sales of the new model were 86 percent higher in the United States than for the previous OnePlus released there, although he did not disclose absolute unit figures. He said sales were higher because of the T-Mobile relationship.

 By Sujata Rao LONDON, Nov 14 (Reuters) - - Europe's stuttering economy and Italy's budget crisis may rule out an interest rate rise next year by the European Central Bank, whose task will be complicated by leadership change, the Chief Investment Officer of Amundi, Europe's biggest fund manager, said on Wednesday. Pascal Blanque, who oversees 1.5 trillion euros ($1.7 trillion) at the Paris-based investment firm, told the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit that another key theme would be a pause in the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy-tightening cycle. Speaking of the ECB, he said that a potential rate rise -- a 10-basis-point interest-rate hike is priced in by money markets for December 2019  -- was also thrown into doubt by the end of President Mario Draghi's term next October. "I don't expect an increase in interest rates (next year)," Blanque said. "Generally speaking, when there is succession at a central bank, it's not the best time for a change in policy -- especially if it's a big one. So I would say that succession adds to the necessity of prudent fine tuning of policy." However, he predicted the ECB would wind down its stimulus programme on schedule next month and saw the Fed still raising rates twice in 2019 as priced by markets. "I think they (the Fed) will deliver what is priced in ….And then we will enter a situation where at least from the market (point of view), pausing will be the theme. If I'm right, saying that at this point, we will get convincing signs of some slowdown," Blanque added. That view means Amundi has been adding duration on U.S. debt and thinks it's time to move away from growth-led, high-priced equity sectors such as tech in favour of high-quality, high-dividend stocks "across the spectrum." Equity markets have been rattled in recent weeks by fears of a slowdown in growth and trade, especially as the impact of U.S. tax cuts on company earnings starts to fade. The U.S. S&P 500  has shed 8 percent in the past month and the tech-heavy Nasdaq  is down 3 percent, led by former market darling Apple. "In terms of geographies, looking to next year, we will see a rotation favouring emerging markets at some point in the year, (and) Europe once Italy is fixed," Blanque said, speaking by video link from Paris. 
 ITALY AND EMERGING MARKETS -- BUT NOT YET Blanque remains optimistic that a resolution will be found for Italy's row with the European Commission over its draft budget, which envisages a deficit three times bigger than earlier promised. But he reckons "we will see wider spreads before we see tighter spreads, and this will provide opportunities". Rome's refusal to accept the EU's call to rein in its expansionary budget plans has pushed Italy's government bond yield spread over Germany -- effectively the risk premium attached to Italian risk -- above 300 basis points, double end-2017 levels. "It is clear that 400 basis points is a threshold, where you can think that there is real pressure exerted on the market by the market", Blanque said, adding that currently he was positioned "neutral" on Italian assets. Amundi is similarly cautious on emerging markets, which have been hammered by the dollar's unexpected 5 percent-plus rally, uncertainty over how China would react to Trump's trade tariffs and currency crises in Turkey and Argentina. "EM is not yet cheap enough to adopt a positive stance, though we should see this moving forward. It's too soon, you need to see more dislocations," Blanque said. "We've seen the bulk of upward pressure on (U.S) interest rates and the dollar ... This should remove uncertainty from the emerging markets space." 
 Blanque also said that for next year, he expected: *Core euro zone yields to remain "under pressure" as long as Italy uncertainties remain *Synchronised global growth giving way to synchronised slowdown *Cutting exposure to U.S. credit *Cautious on UK assets despite a Brexit deal; says large current account deficit leaves three options: currency depreciation, higher in risk premia and growth slowdown. 
 
 Nov 13 (Reuters) - Shares of India'sZee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd  jumped on Wednesday, a day after its promoter planned to sell some of its stake in the company and hired advisers to help transform the business into a global tech-media company. Zee on Tuesday conglomerate Essel Group, which runs the company, intended to divest up to 50 percent of their stake in the television broadcasting and digital media company to a strategic partner (graphic). Shares in the company rose as much as 7.3 pct to 470 rupees, their biggest intraday percentage gain in five weeks. Partners for Zee could include the FAANG stocks, which comprise Facebook Inc, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc  and Alphabet Inc'sGoogle, and John Malone'sLiberty Global, Ambit Capital added. Zee promoters hold 41.6 percent in the company — about 59 percent of this holding is pledged — and will sell only up to 50 percent of their holding at the most. Thus, this should not be seen as the promoters "cashing out", research firm Nomura said. Zee's content library makes it an attractive partner for any global player, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities wrote in a note, adding near-term stock performance depends on strategic investor interest, divestment valuations and decision over operating control. However, the underlying reasons for Essel's divestment, high promoter pledge and liquidity issues in the group's infrastructure business, are worrying, Kotak added. Essel has hired Goldman Sachs Securities (India) Ltd as its investment banker and LionTree as an international strategic adviser to undertake the strategic review, which is expected to be completed by March/April next year, Zee said in a statement. More than 15.6 million shares of Zee were traded on the National Stock Exchange, 5.4 times their 30-day average of 2.9 million shares. Zee stock had lost 24.70 percent this year as of last close. 
 
 Despite its recent post-earnings sell-off,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been on a terrific run in 2018 -- actually,   over the past two years. Still, its market valuation has been   discounted compared to other big tech names, such as the other   FAANG stocks:   Facebook    ,   Amazon    ,   Netflix    , and Google parent   Alphabet    . You can see in the chart below that its forward P/E lags the   others'.     AAPL P/E ratio (forward)    data by   YCharts. That discount is because Apple, unlike the others stocks, is   thought of first and foremost as a hardware company. Combined,   the iPhone, iPad, Mac laptops, and "other" products (such as   headphones) added up to 84% of sales last quarter, with almost   60% coming from the iPhone.Because the iPhone has been such a dominant product for   Apple's top line, the number of iPhone units moved has become   somewhat of an obsession for analysts and investors. But on its   recent fiscal fourth-quarter call, the company announced it would   stop disclosing unit metrics for the iPhone, iPad, and Macs to   the public.Should investors be concerned?  Image source: Getty Images.For skeptics, the first reaction is likely negative. Why is   Apple taking away information? What's the company hiding? Is it   because iPhone unit sales will decline next year?Apple CFO Luca Maestri pointed out on the conference call with   analysts that the company's "top competitors" do not disclose   quarterly unit sales. Still, many companies disclose similar   information. For instance, retail companies will often disclose   both "transactions" (unit sales) and "ticket" (price increases)   separately when discussing   same-store sales    . That's not unlike Apple disclosing units sold and average   selling prices (ASPs).In the just-reported quarter, Apple reported flat iPhone unit   growth, even as iPhone revenue skyrocketed 29%! The ASP of   iPhones rose from $618 to a whopping $793 on the back of the   XS and XS Max release    in September.Skeptics might also point out that if unit sales aren't   disclosed, investors won't know how much the company is raising   prices. This could also be seen as Apple's efforts to escape   scrutiny over continual price increases.On the other hand, it doesn't much matter if Apple hikes   prices and consumers are still willing to pay. That just shows   the increasing value customers see in the iPhone and broader   Apple ecosystem. The company is looking to enhance its moat   through investments in things like payments, facial recognition,   security, and   health monitoring    .The increasing set of features has allowed the company to sell   a wider range of phones at various price points, from the   ultra-high-end iPhone XS to 2016's lower-priced iPhone SE geared   for emerging markets.As Maestri said during the conference call: "As demonstrated   by our financial performance in recent years, the number of units   sold in any 90-day period is not necessarily representative of   the underlying strength of our business. Furthermore, a unit of   sale is less relevant for us today than it was in the past given   the breadth of our portfolio and the wider sales price dispersion   within any given product line."CEO Tim Cook reminded listeners on the conference call that   while iPhone units were flat in the quarter, the overall   installed base grew double digits, meaning a lot of customers   picked up the company's devices for the first time.Expanding the ecosystem will help it sell more services, the   revenue from which was up 17% last quarter to almost $10 billion,   nearly 16% of the total. In addition, iPhone customers tend to   stick with the prestige Apple brand once they're in -- even if   they're purchasing new phones at a slower pace than in the   past.Apple's interpretation of its unit figures, in my opinion, is   spot-on: Apple is a premium ecosystem, not just a commodity   hardware producer. That's the reason   Warren Buffett invested in the company    beginning in 2016.The company doesn't have to worry about price the way other   companies do. As an example, say your iPhone lasts longer than it   did before -- let's say three years, instead of two, thereby   extending the phone's life by 50% -- that means consumers will   likely accept price increases up to 50% per phone, and still feel   like they are getting a good value (assuming each generation of   phones has increased durability and functionality). That   increased value proposition would still fall into the revenue and   profit lines, which is what investors should care about, even if   the units-sold number stagnates or declines.Still, Apple seems like it's trying to steer investors into   seeing the company in its preferred way. It happens to be the   correct way, in my view, but if other parts of the investing   community want to judge the company based on iPhone units sold,   so what? I'd rather the company err on the side of more   disclosures, not fewer.The bottom line is, investors shouldn't fret about this change   in disclosure. Apple's still a buy based on its brand pricing   power and sticky ecosystem.

 By Robyn Mak (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.) HONG KONG, Nov 14 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Apple  lacks an app for Foxconn and its ilk. The $33 billion iPhone assembler just fell short of quarterly earnings expectations. It will add to growing fears of weak demand for Apple's latest model, which has sparked a selloff in supplier shares. The mixed signals from the world's top contract electronics maker will do little to ease concerns that iPhone sales are peaking. Apple's disappointing outlook for the holiday season on Nov. 2 and its decision to stop disclosing unit sales for its devices triggered a sharp decline in its own market value, as well as of those in its supply chain. That was compounded by a subsequent Nikkei report that the once-again sub-$1 trillion company had asked Foxconn and rival Pegatron  to stop extra production lines for the recently released iPhone XR. Profit warnings and reduced sales forecasts from component makers such as Japan Display  followed. Lumentum, which makes lasers used in the iPhone's facial recognition, set off fresh downward stock moves with a warning on Monday. As if that wasn't bad enough, Gou and his peers are facing additional challenges. Churning out fewer but pricier iPhones may help Apple's bottom line, but is likely to squeeze those of Foxconn and others. Equally worrisome is Apple boss Tim Cook turning his company's attention to selling more services, such as apps and cloud storage, as smartphone ownership levels off. The division is on track to account for a quarter of the company's sales by 2022, according to Morgan Stanley, up from less than 15 percent. Investors in Apple suppliers may not be able to afford to stick around for a new strategic download.

Here's Why Tesla (TSLA) Stock Looks Like a Strong Buy Right Now
 Tesla TSLA  has seen its stock price jump over 18% since the electric car power posted impressive third-quarter results. Now, with a new chairman in place, it seems like Elon Musk's company could be on track to return to its status as a Wall Street darling. Quick Q3 Overview Tesla's quarterly revenues surged 128% from $2.98 billion in the year-ago quarter to hit $6.82 billion, which blew away our Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.67 billion. This growth also marked a 70% jump from Q2's $4 billion.Meanwhile, Tesla was able to swing from a quarterly loss of $2.92 per share to post adjusted earnings of $2.90 per share. The company also posted GAAP net income of $312 million. "We expect to again have positive net income and cash flow in Q4 and I believe, our aspiration certainly will be for all quarters going forward," Musk said on Tesla's Q3 earnings call. Bullish Details The EV giant's third quarter results were driven by better-than-expected Model 3 sales, along with higher average selling prices, and improved automotive gross margins. Plus, the Model 3 was the best-selling car in the U.S. in terms of revenue in Q3, topping Toyota TM  , Honda HMC  , and Ford F  models. Meanwhile, Tesla's Model 3 sedan, with more mass market appeal, was the 5 th  best-selling vehicle in terms of volume.Weekly Model 3 unit production averaged 4,300, which fell below Musk's 5,000 goal. But the company produced 5,300 Model 3s in the last week of Q3. Maybe more importantly, the labor hours it took to make a Model 3 fell 30% from the second quarter-which also fell below Model S and Model X for the first time.    Overall, Tesla delivered 56,065 Model 3s at a starting price of $49,000-far above its $35,00 goal-to help bring its U.S. total to nearly 70,000 vehicles. "In Q4, we will focus even further on cost improvements while continuing to increase our production rate," Tesla said in a Q3 statement. Outlook Moving on, Tesla plans to bring the Model 3 to Europe early next year, where it said that the mid-sized premium sedan market is more than twice as large as it is in the U.S. The company also aims to bring "a portion of Model 3 production to China during 2019," which will be designated only for local customers in the world's second-largest economy.At this point, it is worth looking at a what Bloomberg  New Energy Finance projects from the overall electric vehicle market. Bloomberg's  primary research service projects  EV sales will soar from 1.1 million in 2017 to 11 million in 2025. The report also expects EV unit sales to reach a whopping 30 million by 2030, with the jump fueled by cheaper production costs. "China will lead this transition, with sales there accounting for almost 50% of the global EV market in 2025."In the near-term, Tesla's Q4 revenues are projected to skyrocket over 113% to hit $7.01 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. Tesla's full-year revenues are expected to reach $21.30 billion, which would mark an 81% surge from fiscal 2017.    Price Movement Now that we have covered Tesla's Q3 results and its top-line outlook, it's time to see what's going on with TSLA stock. As we mentioned at the top, shares of Tesla have surged since the firm reported its quarterly results on October 24.We can, however, see from the chart that shares of TSLA have cooled down over the last few years. Still, despite some turbulence,  Tesla stock  is up roughly 87% over the last two years, which crushes the S&P 500's 26% jump and even comes in just above Apple AAPL  .Shares of TSLA closed regular trading Tuesday up 2.25% to $338.73 a share. This still marks a roughly 12.5% downturn from its 52-week high of $387.46 per share, and could set up a solid buying opportunity for investors who are high on Tesla.    Earnings Trends Tesla's adjusted fourth-quarter earnings are projected to skyrocket 159% from the year-ago quarter's loss of $3.04 a share to $1.80 per share. Plus, Tesla's earnings estimate revision activity has trended completely upward over the last 30 days for Q4, as well as for fiscal 2018 and 2019. We can also see just how improved Tesla's earnings estimate picture is in the chart below.    Bottom Line Tesla's recent earnings estimate revision activity helps it earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). TSLA also sports an "A" grade for Growth in our Style Scores system.Lastly, many investors are likely still worried about Tesla's current debt levels despite its strong quarter and improved outlook. Yet, it seems very reasonable to believe that Tesla will simply raise the money it needs by selling more stock. Investors would stand to lose out in the short-term. But the cash is 100% necessary for Tesla to reach its long-term goals. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All

 Bad news coming out of Apple's AAPL  supply chain has driven some investors to panic, sending shares swooning.   Specifically, Lumentum, which makes Face ID technology for its latest generation of iPhones, slashed its adjusted EPS guidance range to $1.15 - $1.34 (previous $1.60 - $1.75) and its revenue outlook to $335 million - $355 million (previous $405 million - $430 million) citing notably softer demand at a key customer (this could  be Apple, since the iPhone maker accounted for 30% of its annual revenue).Suppliers Japan Display and British chipmaker IQE also pulled down estimates citing weaker smartphone demand.This followed reports from Japanese daily Nikkei that suppliers Foxconn and Pegatron were halting plans to further expand production lines related to the cheapest of this year's lineup, the XR.Analysts turned negative following Apple's announcement that it would no longer provide details about the number of devices it sells, or even how that breaks down between iPhones, iPads, Macs, etc."The lack of transparency is disappointing, and will likely limit investor's visibility into the company," said BMO Capital's Tim Long. "Our view remains that units may not grow at all going forward, and while average selling prices (ASPs) are still increasing, at some point they will plateau."So first, it was Apple's announcement that it would no longer provide certain numbers, then it was the covering analysts voicing their misgivings, and finally, it's Apple suppliers taking down their forecasts.While things don't look good at this point, the situation was expected. What remains unknown is the extent of damage to Apple, how it will tell on its revenue and profits, how much of it was planned by the company and how much damage control it has up its sleeve.We won't know the impact on the numbers until the next earnings announcement and we already know that the softness is largely driven by saturation in developed markets, weak demand for very high end devices in developing markets (like India), longer replacement cycles and the stronger dollar that makes Apple products more expensive internationally. But it also makes sense to revisit what Apple has knowingly done to boost its services business at the cost of its hardware business.So consider the iOS 12, which for the first time, supports 28 devices, including models that launched way back in 2013. This will allow the camera to launch 70% faster and make the keyboard 50% faster, likely supporting the services Apple badly wants the user to avail.The feeling that Apple is now helping users to hang on to their devices longer may also encourage some to try a more expensive device sometime in the future. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi estimates that this move could extend iPhone replacement cycles by six months to 3.2 years and push unit sales down by 6% percent a year for three years.Second, earlier this year, Apple agreed to pay for battery replacement of older iPhones when they were slowing down, a cost they incurred for the sake of loyalty, so older iPhone users remained in the Apple ecosystem with no need to upgrade.How much of this Apple will make up with increased service revenue is of course unclear, at least in the near to midterm. But its services prospects are bright and the company is also seeing momentum there. Recommendation Because of the increased uncertainty, it's probably a better idea wait for the share price to stabilize before taking any further action. So Apple shares currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Buy-ranked tech stocks worth considering instead would be Diodes Inc. DIOD  , Himax Technologies HIMX  , ACM Research ACMR  and Park City Group PCYG  . But since isnt the best time to invest in tech given the market's concerns about its over valuation, you can also take a look at  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here   . The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce "the world's first trillionaires," but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.

Top Tech StocksMSFT -0.14%AAPL -0.86%IBM -0.33%CSCO -1.19%GOOG -0.54%Technology stocks reversed course Tuesday afternoon, with shares of tech stocks in the S&P 500 were losing just under 0.1% in value, giving back a nearly 1.0% mid-day advance, although the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index was hanging on to a nearly 1.0% gain.Among technology stocks moving on news:(+) Lumentum Holdings' ( LITE  ) was more than 3% higher in late Tuesday trading, drifting off a one-time 10% late-morning advance for the optical and photonic components company despite analysts at Goldman Sachs today cutting their price target for Lumentum shares by $5 apiece to $85 a share. The reduction follows Lumentum early Monday saying a customer - widely believed to be Apple ( AAPL  ) - asked it to "materially reduce shipments." The price cut followed Lumentum Monday lowering its Q4 revenue outlook to a new range of $335 million to $355 million from its prior forecast expecting between $405 million to $430 million in revenue for the three months ending Dec. 31. The company also reduced its forecast for adjusted Q4 net income to between $1.15 to $1.34 per share from its previous range of $1.60 and $1.75 per share.In other sector news:(+) GDS Holdings ( GDS  ) raced as much as 16% higher on Tuesday after the Chinese data-center company reported a 79.7% increase in Q3 revenue over the same quarter last year and also raised its outlook for FY18 revenue. Revenue rose to RMB762.8 million from RMB424.4 million last year and beat the two-analyst mean by RMB56.0 million. Looking forward, the company also is expecting at least RMB2.75 billion in revenue for the 12 months ending Dec. 31. The upbeat revenue total and outlook have been helping GDS Holdings overcome below-consensus adjusted net income, posting a net loss of RMB0.96, or about $0.14, per American depository share compared with RMB0.95 per ADS last year and missing the analyst consensus by RMB0.10 per ADS.(-) Magic Software Enterprises ( MGIC  ) turned fractionally lower just before Tuesday's closing bell, falling less than 1% and giving back a nearly 4% gain earlier in the session that followed the Israeli software firm reporting improved adjusted Q3 net income and revenue compared with year-ago levels. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $0.14 per share during the September quarter compared with $0.12 per share during the same period a year ago. Total revenue rose 9.7% year over year to $72.1 million from $65.7 million last year. Three analysts polled by Capital IQ had been expecting adjusted per-share net earnings of $0.15 on $72.4 million in revenue.(-) EverQuote ( EVER  ) plunged to a record low on Tuesday, sinking 44% to a worst-ever $6.65 a share after its Q3 net loss widened compared with year-ago levels despite an increase in revenue during the September quarter. Net loss for the three months ended Sept. 30 expanded to $0.15 per share, more than doubling the company's $0.07 per share net loss during the same quarter last year. Revenue rose to $41.7 million during the quarter, climbing 30% from $32.1 million last year. Analyst estimates were not available for comparison.
 Despite its efforts to shift the investing narrative away from   unit volumes,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) investors are still fretting about them. That fact   was made clear when shares fell yesterday on fears that   demand for the newest iPhones may not be as strong as initially   hoped, particularly for the iPhone XR, which is more affordable   than the flagship iPhone XS and XS Max and was widely expected to   drive unit volumes    in the fourth quarter.Are those fears overblown?  Image source: Apple.Three prominent Apple suppliers warned yesterday that sales in   the fourth quarter may fall short of prior expectations. Most   notable was   Lumentum Holdings    (NASDAQ: LITE) , which supplies vertical-cavity surface-emitting   lasers (VCSELs), one of the critical parts of Apple's 3D-sensing   TrueDepth camera system. Lumentum drastically cut its outlook for   the December-ended quarter (Lumentum's fiscal second quarter),   suggesting that iPhone demand is tepid. The revised forecast is   significantly lower than the guidance the company   issued less than two weeks ago.Outlook for December QuarterAs of Nov. 1, 2018As of Nov. 12, 2018Revenue$405 million to $430 million$335 million to $355 millionNon-GAAP operating margin28% to 30%23% to 25%Non-GAAP earnings per share$1.60 to $1.75$1.15 to $1.34Data source: Lumentum.At the midpoint, we're talking about a reduction of $72.5   million in Lumentum's sales outlook. "We recently received a   request from one of our largest Industrial and Consumer customers   for laser diodes for 3D sensing to materially reduce shipments to   them during our fiscal second quarter for previously placed   orders that were originally scheduled for delivery during the   quarter," CEO Alan Lowe said in a statement.Meanwhile, Apple's   own guidance    for the December quarter had also fallen short of Street   expectations.Seeing as how the iPhone business still represents over 60% of   total revenue, it's not entirely misplaced for investors to worry   about unit volumes. However, Apple CFO Luca Maestri believes that   "the number of units sold in any 90-day period is not necessarily   representative of the underlying strength of our business," which   is why Apple will no longer disclose unit volumes at all. The   company will instead provide product revenue, while providing new   detail regarding gross margin in its increasingly important   services business.In other words, Apple is trying to force investors to stop   paying so much attention to iPhone unit volumes, but it's clear   that shareholders are still doing just that. It also means that   investors will no longer be able to validate those fears. Perhaps   once the company starts reporting just how profitable its   services business is -- a segment that also lacks seasonality --   investors will finally focus where Apple wants them to.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe recent volatility in the markets has been fairly rough on many stocks. But not Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ). It's as if the company is in another universe! Since early October, SBUX stock has gone from $57 to $68.The latest earnings report was definitely a key. But it also helps that SBUX stock is likely to remain resilient because it has a steady business. Hey, even if there is a full economic slowdown, it seems like a good bet that people will still be drinking coffee, right?I think so.Now it's true that Starbucks stock is not necessarily cheap. Note that the price-to-earnings ratio is about 21x and the dividend is a moderate 2%.Yet in today's market, SBUX stock may be a pretty good haven. So let's take a look at three factors for the bull case:SBUX certainly has its challenges. In the U.S. market, the competition is intense, with many small operators as well as large players like Dunkin Brands (NASDAQ: DNKN ) and Mcdonald's (NYSE: MCD ). Keep in mind that there has also be lackluster traffic numbers.Yet SBUX has a valuable brand, which has allowed for better pricing power. For example, during the latest quarter, the same-store sales growth came to 4%, which was above the expectations of 2% to 3%. There was also global growth of 3%, up from the consensus forecast of 2.4%.To drive this growth, SBUX has made the No. 1 priority the focus on improving the in-store experience. Although, this is not just about changing the design or aesthetics of the locations. Instead, SBUX is making an aggressive effort to improve the operational efficiencies of its stores. Note that the goal is to cut up to 50% of in-store administrative tasks by fiscal year 2019, which will mean more time for employees to focus on customers. Some of the initiatives include automated inventory and better training.SBUX moved early in adopting mobile payments - and this has paid off in a big way. More and more people are using their smartphones as their digital wallets.According to research from eMarketer , SBUX is expected to have the most popular payments app, at 23.4 million users. This compares to the projections of 22 million for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and 11.1 million for Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) - though of course Starbucks' app is just for buying Starbucks.A key, of course, is that SBUX is a daily habit for millions of people. It also helps that the app is tied to a rewards program, which allows for more customer loyalty and personalization. During the latest quarter, the membership base grew by 15% to 15.3 million (in the U.S.) and about 14% of all transactions come from Mobile Order and Pay.Leadership transitions are always difficult. This is especially the case when the former CEO is a … legend. No doubt, this situation applies to SBUX, which was built by Howard Schultz.The good news is that the new CEO, Kevin Johnson, has done a pretty good job so far. He has expanded the mobile app to everyone, regardless if they are part of the rewards program. He has also improved SKUs as well as sold off Tazo to Unilever (NYSE: UN ) and shutdown locations of Teavana.But perhaps Johnson's most important initiative has been to invest in China. True, this is controversial because of the slowing growth in the country and the uncertainty regarding tariffs. But Johnson realizes that he needs to take the long view - and this means not getting antsy about China. SBUX still has lots of runway left in the country and the middle class is likely to see strong gains for many years to come - providing considerable opportunity for sustainable growth.Tom Taulli is the author of  High-Profit IPO Strategies ,  All About Commodities  and  All About Short Selling . Follow him on Twitter at  @ttaulli . As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post 3 Reasons to Remain Bullish on SBUX Stock appeared first on InvestorPlace .

The Latest Smartphone News from Apple & Samsung
    On today's episode of the Tech Talk Tuesday podcast, Ryan McQueeney discusses the latest news from the smartphone industry, including worries that Apple's iPhone X line is underperforming and fresh rumors emerging about Samsung's foldable touchscreen device.Remember to subscribe and leave a rating on Apple Podcasts  if you enjoy the show!Smartphone diehards have already had at least a couple of major stories to digest this week, with one being delivered by each of the arguably two most powerful brand names in the global industry.For Apple AAPL  , the story involved continued concern that the latest updates to the iPhone X line are not selling as well as the Cupertino-based behemoth had hoped.Investors were clued in to this possibility last week thanks to reports that Apple had told suppliers to ditch plans for additional production lines for the iPhone XR, and on Monday, that theory was given even more evidence.This is because key Apple supplier Lumentum Holdings LITE  , which makes 3D chips used in the company's FaceID architecture, issued a profit warning and cautioned that one of its biggest clients had recently reduced the scope of its order.Apple was not named specifically, but analysts quickly connected the dots and suggested that Lumentum's warning could represent as much as a 30% cut to the iPhone maker's order.It is just an "S" year for Apple, but the company's decision to offer a lower-cost "R" version of its flagship smartphone seemed to offer the industry a potential new trend. Now it seems that strategy might not be connecting quite as well as expected.Meanwhile, Apple rival-and largest smartphone manufacturer in the world-Samsung SSNLF  also made headlines Monday thanks to excitement over its upcoming foldable touchscreen device.The "flip-phone" smartphone from Samsung has been rumored for a long time, but the South Korean tech giant only just officially acknowledged the new technology last week. Samsung has dubbed the tech behind the foldable design "Infinity Flex Display" and said it plans to start mass producing it in a "matter of months."But reports from South Korea's Yonhap News Agency added more details to that reveal, saying that the actual phone will be called the "Galaxy F" and might retail for as much as $1,770. The Galaxy F will reportedly debut in March, just one month after Samsung plans to reveal the Galaxy S10.Should Apple investors be concerned? Was this year's iPhone roster simply not that cool? Is there any way Samsung's foldable smartphone becomes a hit?

Tuesday's ETF with Unusual Volume: XNTK
          VIDEO: Tuesday's ETF with Unusual Volume: XNTK  
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTech stocks have gone from the darlings to the dogs of Wall Street. In just one month, the technology sector sunk 10%! For many beaten-down tech stocks, this selloff is just a blip on the long-term climb higher.This is because overall the fundamentals, i.e. long-term healthy demand and huge market opportunities, remain firmly in place. After all, whether or not you like it, we still live in a society dominated by Big Tech, and that's not about to change anytime soon.Using TipRanks , I can dig down to the outlook for these stocks, upside potential and analyst consensus rating.With that in mind, let's dive into these top tech stock picks now:Firing on all cylinders is how five-star Jefferies analyst John Difucci describes RingCentral Inc (NYSE: RNG ). RNG is a provider of cloud-based communications and collaboration solutions for businesses. Its recently released third-quarter earnings smashed expectations, as did 2018 revenue guidance (raised even above the 3Q beat). The company announced several large new international wins, reflecting a massive new market opportunity.In short: "very healthy momentum" is afoot. That makes this stock a secular winner and quality SaaS asset.Difucci's "buy" rating came with a bullish $105 price target. This suggests upside potential of 24%- Ka-Ching! Worthy of note is that Difucci ( Track Record & Ratings ) ranks as one of the Top 25 Wall Street analysts on TipRanks. So it's clear he knows a thing or two about stock picking. Plus shares are currently down on a 3-month basis (but up year-to-date). However, it's the stock long-term potential that really makes this stock a bargain right now.Not that Difucci's alone in his RNG bull call: this is a stock with a 'Strong Buy' Street consensus. In the last three months, top analysts have published five Buy ratings on RNG, vs. one hold rating. Meanwhile, the average price target stands at $97. Interested in RNG stock?  Get a free RNG Stock Research Report.Shares in Boingo Wireless Inc (NASDAQ: WIFI ) have plunged 22% in the last three months. That makes this stock particularly appealing right now. The world is becoming increasingly connected- and Boingo is partly responsible. Boingo provides high-speed wi-fi service to airports, hotels, military bases and other public places worldwide. Its small cell networks reach over a billion people annually says the company."Boingo has successfully transitioned its business model to become a wholesale shared infrastructure/spectrum company, enabling connectivity in dense locations" cheers Oppenheimer's Timothy Horan ( Track Record & Ratings ). He sees shares surging 60% from current levels all the way to $39.Yes Q3 results came in mixed, but long-term trends remain strong says Horan. And additional catalysts on the horizon include international growth, small cells, 5G, and possible REIT conversion. Indeed, Boingo has been more aggressive pursuing international deals, recently announcing a large deal in Brazil to provide 54 airports with WiFi. International revenue only makes up 5% of the current revenue mix, but Horan thinks this can double over a few years.Add in the fact that WIFI could also be an M&A target for a larger shared infrastructure company, and you can see why this stock still boasts 100% Street support. Get the WIFI Stock Research Report.Cloud communications stock Vonage Holding Corp. (NYSE: VG ) uses your Internet connection to make and receive calls. Now's the time to get in early. The company is at a critical juncture. It's transitioning away from consumer (higher-margin business) and investing for growth in business.Indeed, business services now mmakeup 59% of revenue, which should reach 75% in 2020E. This is due to solid growth and the savvy acquisition of NewVoiceMedia (NVM).NVM is a premier cloud contact center that expands VG's business communications suite, adds valuable crossselling opportunities and go-to-market relationships with CRM service providers says Oppenheimer's Horan ( Track Record & Ratings ). He sees shares surging 48% in the coming months."We maintain our $17 PT, based on our SoTP [sum-of-the-parts model and consider today's drop a buying opportunity," the analyst wrote post 3Q results. Total revenue missed by 150 bps but normalized/organic growth was in line and should improve. Four analysts have rated the stock recently: all are bullish. Their average price target of $18.33 translates into 60% upside potential.  Get the VG Stock Research Report.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock is looking pretty bruised right now. First, it disappointed with revenue guidance for the crucial holiday shopping quarter. Then it revealed unit sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs won't be reported anymore. This sneaky move means Apple can mask lower unit sales with higher selling prices.Not surprisingly this jaw-dropper was followed by a couple of analyst downgrades. All in all, shares are now down 9% in just one month. For Apple supporters, this pullback means the stock is now trading at a steep discount. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, for example, see shares reaching $310. This mean shares can climb over 50% to $310. He sees Services becoming a whopping $50 billion by fiscal 2020.Plus "Based on our analysis we believe 350 million iPhones are in the "window of opportunity" to upgrade over the next 12-18 months with Apple needing to capture a majority of these units as part of this upgrade cycle to make a clearly successful iPhone product cycle in 2019" notes Ives ( Track Record & Ratings ).Overall, this 'Moderate Buy' stock is currently juggling 17 buy ratings, 10 hold ratings and 1 sell rating. Its average price target is $239. Get the AAPL Stock Research Report.Blucora, Inc. (NASDAQ: BCOR ) is looking like a steal right now. It's been way oversold. The company provides tech-enabled financial solutions to consumers, small business owners, and tax professionals across the US.The company is currently trading down 16% in the last month. Blucora reported third quarter financial results that were above both analysts' expectations and management's guidance. Full-year 2018 guidance was narrowed (raised the bottom end, lowered the top end), which forced analysts to reduce Q4/18 estimates and the stock to fall. However bear in mind shares are still up 38% year-to-date- and crucially, have the potential to soar much higher." At current levels, Blucora is trading at 2.5x our 2019 revenue estimate, 11.5x our 2019 adjusted EBITDA estimate and 13.2x our 2019 non-GAAP EPS estimate, a big discount to its Tax Prep peer group, which trades (on average) at 4.7x, 12.4x and 21.9x, respectively" writes Barrington Research analyst Alexander Paris ( Track Record & Ratings ).He continues: We believe the stock is oversold and, as such, are reiterating our 'outperform' investment rating and $40 price target, which assumes an 18x multiple on our 2019 adjusted EPS estimate and suggests 40% upside from current levels." Get the BCOR Stock Research Report.Software stock PTC Inc (NASDAQ: PTC ) provides tech solutions that transform how products are created and serviced. This involves everything from augmented reality to 3D printing.CEO Jim Heppelmann doesn't hold back when he says: "We stand at the frontier of a new age of innovation, where the industrial revolution is colliding head on with the digital revolution…"And now Evercore analyst Ken Talanian ( Track Record & Ratings ) has met up with PTC's CFO, Andrew Miller. "PTC management brought an upbeat tone to meetings that we believe is appropriately reflective of results" the analyst wrote post-meeting.Encouragingly, PTC's business sees little evidence of a slowing macro environment. In fact, management noted that in the last three quarters the company hasn't seen a properly qualified deal go away and many deals are seeing upsizing."We view the recent selloff as largely sentiment driven given that PTC's fundamentals were strong in F4Q18 and the company offered compelling guidance for F19" says Talanian.Net-net this is an opportunity to buy shares at a considerable discount to the $94.50 at which ROK priced its well diligenced $1B investment. Indeed, analysts see upside potential of over 30% for this 'Strong Buy' stock. Get the PTC Stock Research Report.Cheap isn't necessarily the first word that comes to mind when you're looking at a stock priced above $1000. But Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) still has a cheap multiple relative to growth and relative to peers."Our view is that Alphabet is the more defensive play of the FANGs in this volatile market environment" gushes Aegis Capital analyst Victor Anthony ( Track Record & Ratings ).The stock has multiple support and has multiple growth levers in play that should drive shareholder value, says the analyst. At $1,425 his price target suggests shares could rise over 33%.Anthony wasn't in the least disturbed by Q3 results, noting that even though core Google Website revenue growth of 22% decelerated 4pts from 26% 2Q18, this was off a 3pt tougher comp - so a solid growth trend.Meanwhile, self-driving unit Waymo, the sleeping giant within the portfolio, has started to generate revenue and is testing additional monetization models."Despite the business continuing to benefit from multiple secular tailwinds the shares have been hindered due to margin concerns, regulatory concerns, and GDPR risks" writes Aegis. However, he sees the stock working through these concerns due to growth opportunities in Search as result of new and enhanced ad formats and AI, continued strength at YouTube, and growth of enterprise cloud computing.Out of 29 analysts polled on GOOGL, 26 are bullish while only three are sidelined. In total ,the average price target works out at $1,350 (26% upside potential).

  Qualcomm    (NASDAQ: QCOM) shed more than 10% of its market value this year   after it avoided a takeover bid by   Broadcom    , lost its own takeover bid for   NXP    , and faced fresh regulatory probes and lawsuits from OEMs --   most notably   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) and   Huawei    -- which claimed that its wireless licensing fees were too   high.Qualcomm tried to offset some of the damage with a $30   billion buyback plan, but the chipmaker's fourth quarter report   didn't boost investor confidence. Its revenue fell 2% annually to   $5.8 billion, while its non-GAAP net income declined 7% to $1.3   billion. Its non-GAAP EPS, buoyed by buybacks, fell 2%.  Image source: Getty Images.For the first quarter, Qualcomm expects its revenue to drop   13%-26% annually due to an 18%-26% drop in its MSM chip shipments   and unresolved issues at its licensing business, but for its   non-GAAP EPS -- again lifted by buybacks -- to rise 7%-17%. That   guidance indicates that Qualcomm's headaches won't end anytime   soon.However, Qualcomm's stock also looks cheap at 12 times forward   earnings, and it pays a forward dividend yield of 3.9%. The bulls   will likely argue that low valuation and high dividend should   buoy Qualcomm's stock as it sorts through its legal challenges,   gears up for the launch of 5G networks, diversifies away from its   mobile business, and continues repurchasing shares to lift its   earnings and tighten up its valuations. But is Qualcomm's yield   worth all the drama?Qualcomm has hiked its dividend annually for over a decade. In   fiscal 2018, it spent $3.5 billion on dividends and $22.6 billion   on buybacks. However, Qualcomm's dividend payments also used up   over 100% of its earnings and free cash flow over the past year.   In fact, the chipmaker was unprofitable on a GAAP basis in 2018,   reporting a loss of $3.32 per share as it paid out $2.38 in   dividends.However, those payout ratios were distorted by taxes,   stock-based compensation expenses, and other one-time charges,   which were excluded from its non-GAAP earnings. On a non-GAAP   basis, Qualcomm's EPS of $3.69 easily covered its dividend.   Furthermore, its dividends, buybacks, and debt payments were   mainly paid out with the cash which it previously set aside for   its   failed takeover of NXP    .As a result, Qualcomm's cash and equivalents dropped from   $38.6 billion to $12.1 billion between the fourth quarters of   2017 and 2018. Simply put, Qualcomm shouldn't have any trouble   maintaining its streak of dividend growth as long as it moves   past its one-time expenses and turns around its core   business.Unfortunately, Qualcomm is struggling with two main problems.   First, the chipmaking (QCT) unit -- which generates most of its   revenue -- faces a saturated smartphone market filled with   cheaper rivals like   MediaTek    and first-party chipmakers like   Huawei    . Apple's recent decision to replace Qualcomm's modems in its new   iPhones with   Intel    's (NASDAQ: INTC) exacerbated the pain.  Image source: Getty Images.Second, its licensing (QTL) unit -- which traditionally   generates most of its profits -- is under fire from regulators   and OEMs, which claim that its cut (up to 5% of the wholesale   price of a phone) is too high. Rival chipmakers also claim that   Qualcomm used anti-competitive strategies to dominate the mobile   chipset market.Qualcomm believes that it can resolve its patent disputes with   new agreements, grow both its QCT and QTL revenues with the 5G   ramp-up, and keep buying back shares to soften the blow of its   declining net income. Qualcomm might try to buy another chipmaker   again, but it will likely use buybacks and dividends to placate   shareholders instead -- which won't offset its lack of revenue   growth forever.There's also no evidence that Qualcomm's headwinds will wane   anytime soon. It was already fined in China, South Korea,   and Europe; US regulators recently ruled that Qualcomm must   license its technology to rivals like Intel; and Reuters recently   reported that Apple wasn't ready to settle its   escalating legal battles    against Qualcomm "at any level." Apple will also reportedly   wait until 2020    to launch a 5G iPhone powered by an Intel modem instead of   launching one earlier with Qualcomm's chips.Qualcomm's downside could be limited, but there are plenty of   other stocks that pay   higher dividends    with less drama. Qualcomm should focus more on solving its   long-term issues instead of inflating its earnings and giving its   CEO an   undeserved raise    . Therefore, investors should move on and seek out other income   stocks instead.  10 stocks we like better than Qualcomm       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGiven enough time, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) could arguably beat anybody it wants to on nearly any front. Indeed, Amazon stock has gained more than 9000% since its IPO back in 1997 beating anybody who stood in its way.More recently though, the ecommerce and cloud-computing giant has chosen to team up with other organizations as a means of expanding its footprint and/or reach.Case in point: Amazon is now selling select devices made byApple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) at its shopping site. It's unusual, in that it's a partnership that wouldn't have been forged in the past as the two titans were also competitors in some product categories.In and of itself it's an interesting side story, but hardly a showstopper. Take a closer look at some more recent headlines, however, and owners of Amazon stock may begin to wonder of the company ever says "no" to any proposed team-up.For the record, Apple's HomePod smart speaker won't be available via Amazon, as that hits a little too close to home. Amazon's Echo smart speaker is still crushing its competition. Apple's iPads, iPhones and its smart watches are all to be listed though, if they aren't already, even though Amazon's Fire tablet competes with the iPad.In the grand scheme of things, however, the Apple partnership is a relatively benign one.Take, for instance, the fact that Amazon's digital assistant Alexa, the one that powers the Echo, is now available for use on computers with Windows 10 , developed and sold by indirect rival Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ).No Echo account is needed, as has been the case until now. The two companies aren't exactly mortal enemies, but one would think there's enough overlap that neither would want to feed the other.Then there's Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO ). The two organizations are teaming up to bring a new kind of cloud computing option to the market.Companies that want or need to keep sensitive information stored securely rather than on a remote server, but still need remote cloud storage for other data and apps, can plug into the " world's first native hybrid Kubernetes environment for AWS ," co-developed by the two outfits.It's interesting, just because if Amazon really wanted to, it could have developed such a solution on its own.To be clear, Amazon stock owners have seen several partnerships take shape over the years. Last year it began selling Kenmore-branded home appliances , a name owned and tightly controlled by Sears Holdings (OTCMKTS: SHLDQ ). It's deepened its relationship with the NFL to livestream some NFL games .Retailer Kohl's (NYSE: KSS ) will now accept returns of merchandise bought through Amazon.com , if a consumer doesn't want to bother boxing it up and shipping it back themselves.And there are many more deals being made you hear next to nothing about.These partnerships range in quality from "impressive" to "not too important" to "what's the point?" It's conceivable that not even Amazon fully understands the potential upside and downside of these occasionally-strange partnerships. But, that's ok.Amazon is willing to experiment, and more than that, it may be the most adept company in the world when it comes to learning from a failed experiment.It also must be noted that with roughly $100 billion worth of liabilities on the books, heavy spending on new solo projects may not be an ideal use of funds.Perhaps more than anything though, Amazon understands the simple premise that it doesn't have to turn a profit with every single project it takes on to make it a project worth taking on. Sometimes, just having a seat at the table allows for a certain measure of control that lets the company steer consumers towards its products and services that do drive a profit.Current and prospective owners of Amazon stock can look for more dealmaking, as opposed to developing things on its own, for the foreseeable future for a couple of different reasons.The first of those reasons is, Amazon's sheer size and complexity has arguably made it tough to manage a massive number of disparate projects. It's likely to be more cost-effective in many cases to outsource much of any legwork that has to be done to a partner that's willing to share in the benefit of a venture.Second, and on a more philosophical note, Amazon may be realizing that the degree of control it exerts in so many markets has made it a target on many sides. Not only are government-based antitrust concerns being voiced, the company's dominance is prompting rivals to team up as well.For instance, last year Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Walmart (NYSE: WMT ) hooked up to develop voice-based shopping solutions that would slow down the growth of Amazon's Echo-based shopping option.The response to that feature now offered via Google Assistant has only been lukewarm, but it does point to a trend that will only accelerate the more the ecommerce outfit strives to win the world all to itself.The great irony is, with a growing army of partners at its disposal (misfits or not), the Amazon monolith may be even more immovable than it would be if it were flying solo on all fronts.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

 After a blood-red Monday in the U.S. market indexes - including more than 2% sell-offs on both the Dow and Nasdaq, including a 600-point drop in the Big 30 - we see some green across the board in today's pre-market, albeit relatively slight. A negative supply outlook for  Apple  AAPL   yesterday, along with a deceleration in iPhone unit shipments expected, helped the indexes to their leg down, falling by roughly $5 per share. Apple is down another 1%+ in today's early session.Additional market concerns - from still-lower  oil prices  amid a new growing supply glut, potential auto import tariffs of a whopping 25%, and election results in Florida which remain unresolved nearly a week since polling places closed - also tore through market expectations, as November struggles to fight back from the big losses we saw in October - the lowest trading month of calendar 2018. The Dow still trades up for the year, around 550 points overall.Reports of trade negotiations back on between the U.S. and China this morning, from both the  Wall Street Journal   (WSJ) and the  South China Morning Post  , indicate that some of the tensions are easing between the top two economies in the world. The WSJ reported that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin had a pleasant phone call with Chinese Vice Premier Lu, and the Chinese publication's statement that relations "atmosphere is much better now" between the two countries. Real results, however, are not expected until after the G-20 summit late this month, when President Trump meets world leaders including China's Xi Jinping.Elsewhere,  Home Depot  HD   clobbered estimates on its Q3 bottom line, reporting $2.51 per share versus the Zacks consensus of $2.27 and the year-ago quarter's $1.84 per share. Revenues of $26.39 billion in the quarter also outperformed the $26.24 billion analysts had expected, as well as the $25.0 billion in the year-ago quarter. Yet guidance looks a tad weak considering these new strong figures, and HD shares, while still in the green since the earnings release, have seen its gains dwindle to around 1.2% at this hour.  For more on HD's earnings, click here.  Tyson Foods  TSN   also easily beat earnings estimates, posting $1.58 per share compared to the $1.33 expected and the $1.43 in the year-ago fiscal Q4. However, revenues came in 1.5% light to $10 billion in the quarter, and beneath the $10.15 billion reported in fiscal Q4 2017. This marks the third revenue miss for the poultry producing major, and shares are down 4.3% at this point in the pre-market.  For more on TSN's earnings, click here.  Advance Auto Parts  AAP   was another earnings topper this morning, reporting $1.89 per share versus the $1.77 expected and $1.43 a year ago. Revenues also beat expectations to $2.3 billion from $2.2 billion in the Zacks consensus, up 4.6% year over year. Shares are doing very well this morning, up 5.6% in today's early trading.  For more on AAP's earnings, click here.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn early November, consumer electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reported fourth-quarter numbers that, while good, were overshadowed by a weak holiday quarter guide which implied soft demand for the company's core iPhones. Ever since, Apple stock has been struggling. AAPL is down 13% in November alone, and is 17% off recent highs.With the broader stock market in turmoil, investors are naturally asking: when will Apple stock bottom?We've seen this rodeo before. Believe it or not, the world's biggest and strongest company has had down-drafts before. Notably, Apple stock has had two periods of prolonged and material weakness over the past decade. Both times, much like this time, the sell-off was sparked by concerns over waning iPhone demand. Both times, those concerns were overstated in the big picture, and AAPL stock ultimately rebounded.Thus, history says this isn't the end of Apple stock. Rather, it is just a correction in an otherwise secular growth stock.But, history also says that a bottom may not be in just yet. I'm bullish on AAPL at current levels given strong go-forward growth fundamentals, a favorable valuation, and the company's high-quality financial attributes which should be given more merit amid stock market volatility. Nonetheless, prior downdrafts in Apple stock have been much more severe under similar conditions.Thus, while I'm bullish in the long term, I also fear there may be more near term downside ahead. Long term investors shouldn't be too concerned about this. But, they should be aware of it, because "buying the dip" might be something that requires a good deal of patience.Apple stock currently sits about 17% off recent highs. That may seem like a big plunge for a formerly trillion dollar company. It is. But, AAPL stock also isn't foreign to such big drops.Notably, AAPL has had two big periods of prolonged and material weakness over the past decade. Both sell-offs ended with big rebounds, and Apple stock subsequently tracking to new highs. But, both sell-offs were also much bigger and lasted much longer than the current sell-off.The first was in 2012-13, when everyone was worried about slowing iPhone 5 demand . During that selloff, Apple stock dropped 40% off recent highs, and didn't really bottom until seven months after it peaked.The second major sell-off was in 2015-16. Back then, everyone was worried about slowing iPhone demand , too. During that selloff, Apple stock dropped 30% off recent highs, and didn't bottom until twelve-plus months after it peaked.We have the same problems today. Everyone is worried about slowing iPhone demand. Apple's holiday quarter guide was weak. iPhone suppliers have also delivered weak guides. Analyst channel checks have been largely bearish. Estimates are coming down.Thus, we have a similar set-up here as we had in the prior two sell-offs. But, relative to those sell-offs, this one is the junior version. AAPL stock is just 17% off recent highs, and the selloff has lasted just over a month. Moreover, during the 2012-13 and 2015-16 selloffs, Apple stock bottomed at a trailing earnings multiple below 10. Today, AAPL still trades at 16x forward earnings.In other words, while history says that Apple stock will eventually rebound, it also says that this rebound won't happen just yet.The long-term fundamentals supporting Apple stock are strong, so I don't think long-term oriented investors should give up on the name. Instead, investors should just exercise caution and patience in buying the dip.iPhone revenue growth is slowing, yes, and unit growth is null. But average-selling-price growth is robust, and this remains a solid growth business through a stabilized unit base and higher ASPs. Meanwhile, the iPad and Mac businesses are also largely stable. The "Other Products" business is ramping up growth, led by big gains in Apple Watch. And, most importantly, the high-margin Services business continues to grow at a ~30% rate.In other words, the growth fundamentals of this business are still very good. Plus, the financial strengths of Apple (global reach, stable demand, healthy balance sheet, and relatively low multiple) will become more and more attractive to investors the choppier markets get.Overall, Apple stock isn't a sell here. The long-term fundamentals are simply too strong. Once near-term noise clears, this stock will have healthy runway to head higher.Apple stock is a great long-term investment. Because of its strong long-term fundamentals, AAPL  isn't a sell here.But, investors may want to exercise patience and caution in buying the dip. Prior sell-offs in Apple stock have been bigger and longer than the current one. If history repeats itself, there's more pain ahead before the big rebound.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AAPL. The post Has Apple Stock Bottomed Yet? appeared first on InvestorPlace .
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere are growing concerns that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) isn't seeing expected iPhone XR sales. As a result, Apple stock got hammered yesterday, closing down over 5%. While the possibility of a continued slowdown in iPhone sales has AAPL investors on edge, it's the company's suppliers that are taking the real hit.The iPhone XR was supposed to be the new iPhone that had all the right elements to kick off an upgrade cycle. It has the latest iPhone features, a big screen, cool new colors, long battery life and an affordable price ($250 less than the cheapest iPhone XS). When pre-orders for latest iPhone began in October, there was a feeling that the iPhone XR checked off so many boxes for consumers that it would sell, and sell big . The upside for Apple stock was considerable.Not so fast …It appears that consumers didn't read the analyst notes, because there are warning signs they are not beating a path to the local Apple Store.Yesterday, two of Apple's key iPhone suppliers warned of weak results because of reduced demand from their largest customer: Apple. Foxconn , the company that assembles most of Apple's iPhones, missed revenue expectations when it reported its earnings yesterday. Japan Display , a supplier of iPhone XR displays, posted a loss yesterday and lowered forecasts based on weaker than expected demand from smartphone makers. Lumentum (NASDAQ: LITE ) a company that supplies components for the iPhone's FaceID system lowered its sales forecast based on its largest customer reducing orders … Apple is Lumentum's largest customer.Analysts were quick to react. MacRumors reported that Ming-Chi Kuo, a noted Apple analyst who is usually bullish on the company released a research note cutting estimates for iPhone XR shipments . Kuo feels that factors, including the trade war with China , expectations that the iPhone XR should have had a dual camera and narrower bezels and competition in the Chinese market from Huawei are hurting Apple. As a result, he has cut his estimate for the number of iPhone XR units AAPL is expected to sell during this product lifecycle (in other words, until next year's iPhones are released) from 100 million to 70 million.There was enough noise yesterday about lower than expected iPhone XR sales for Apple stock to take a big hit, erasing its gains through the late summer and fall.It has always been risky to be an iPhone supplier. Until recently, the biggest danger was that Apple would decide to move to a custom component , ditching a supplier altogether. In the current era of slow iPhone sales, the risk is that Apple places a big order, then slashes it.Apple stock may have taken a 5% drubbing on Monday, but Lumentum saw a third of its value disappear after reporting orders for its facial recognition sensors had been slashed.As Bloomberg points out, AAPL is going through a rough patch with iPhone sales, but it has options . It can raise prices to make up for reduced volume, and it is increasingly leveraging services for the 1.3 billion devices it already has out there. It's also focusing on making existing iPhones last longer in the hope of building customer satisfaction. The company's suppliers? When orders are cut, they have to scramble to find new customers, and with the overall smartphone market slowing, that's not easy. They are also often left with inventory of components that makes them vulnerable to Apple coming back and pushing for price cuts.If you're an AAPL investor, Monday's hammering of Apple stock hurt, but is likely nothing more than a blip in the long term. But the results of slower than expected iPhone XR sales are making much bigger waves in Apple's supply chain, where the real damage is being done.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s.The post Apple Stock Got Hammered, But Its Suppliers Are Suffering a Worse Fate appeared first on InvestorPlace .
 Chip giant   Broadcom    (NASDAQ: AVGO) is a key supplier of chips for   Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL) popular iPhone product line. Indeed,   TechInsights recently did a teardown of the latest iPhone XS Max,   and it found a Broadcom Wi-Fi/Bluetooth chip,   3D Touch sensor    , as well as an Avago front-end module (FEM) chip. (The current   Broadcom Limited was formed through the combination of companies   called Broadcom and Avago.)Apple is a big customer of Broadcom's, with Broadcom saying in   its most recent 10-K filing that "aggregate sales to Apple, Inc.,   through all channels, accounted for more than 20% of our net   revenue for fiscal year 2017 and 15% for fiscal year 2016."  Image source: Apple.What's more is that Broadcom's sales to Apple are through its   wireless communications business, which generated $5.4 billion --   more than 30.6% of Broadcom's total sales. This means Apple made   up north of 65% of Broadcom's wireless communications revenue   that year.Although iPhone unit shipments have stagnated in recent years,   Broadcom has managed to grow its Apple-related business through   increases in the total value of the chips that it supplies into   each iPhone. Although Broadcom's wireless business is set to   suffer a setback    this year as Apple lost some content in the   iPhone XR    to a competitor, CEO Hock Tan is optimistic that its wireless   business will get back to "double-digit growth in fiscal 2020,   following a temporary dip in fiscal 2019."It seems that Apple's upcoming transition to 5G wireless will   help support the growth in Broadcom's wireless business. Let's   take a closer look at Tan's comments.Even though Apple isn't expected to launch its first   5G-capable iPhone until 2020    , Broadcom's expecting a return to double-digit revenue growth in   its fiscal 2020. That timing suggests that it expects a solid   boost in wireless chip content in Apple's 2019 iPhones.This isn't a surprise considering that next year's iPhones are   likely to use   Intel    's (NASDAQ: INTC) XMM 7660 modem, which promises a significant   boost in LTE download speeds compared to the   XMM 7560 modem that's in all of this year's   models    . That boost in wireless capability should also lead to a boost   in Broadcom's radio frequency (RF) chip content to support the   dramatically faster wireless speeds of which this modem is   capable.On top of that, Tan indicated that Broadcom is "well   positioned to win back the platform," referencing the fact that   it lost business in this year's iPhone XR. The combination of the   increase in wireless complexity as well as Broadcom winning the   business in the next iPhone XR should help Broadcom achieve its   fiscal 2020 wireless growth ambition.With that said, just getting one year of wireless content   growth isn't going to satisfy investors over the long run. Tan   said that "with 5G on the horizon, we expect this cadence of   annual upgrades to sustain.""As a result, we are maintaining our high level of investment   as the market transitions to 5G," Tan asserted.RF chips aren't the only things it sells to Apple (as well as   to other premium smartphone makers), so it's unsurprising that   the executive also indicated that the industrywide transition to   the more advanced 802.11ax standard will "continue to keep us in   the lead.""We believe we are very well positioned to sustain this   particular franchise over the next several years," Tan   claimed.  10 stocks we like better than Broadcom Ltd       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Dow Slumps 600 Points: 4 Best No-Load Mutual Fund Picks
 Sharp decline in shares of Apple Inc. AAPL  and a strong U.S. dollar weighed on the broader markets, with the Dow falling 602 points on Nov 12. Given the bearish scenario, no-load mutual funds have once again grabbed attention. Mutual funds with no sales or commission charges are known as no-load funds. This generally happens when funds are traded directly through the investment company and not through some secondary entity.This implies that they do not carry the burden of management funds unlike funds with entry or exit loads. It comes as no surprise that no-load funds have managed to provide better returns over their load peers so far this year. Apple Slump Dragged Dow by 600 Points The share price of Apple declined 5% on Nov 12 after one of its major suppliers Lumentum Holdings Inc. (LITE) reduced its earnings and revenue outlook for the fiscal second quarter of 2019. Further, Lumentum Holdings said that "one of its largest industrial and consumer customers for laser diodes for 3D sensing" - most likely Apple - has requested to "materially reduce shipments."Additionally, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) settled at around 97.58 on Nov 12, its highest level since Jun 23, 2017. The Fed signaled that it will increase the key interest rate for the fourth time in December. High rate hike prospects and fears of a possible no-Brexit deal in turn had a positive impact on the U.S. dollar. Decline in Apple and a higher greenback led the blue-chip index Dow to fall 2.3%or 602.12 points, to 25,387.18. Why Invest in No-Load Funds? No-load funds are those that do not bear any sales or commission charge at the time of buying or selling funds. This generally happens when funds are traded directly through the investment company and not through some secondary entity. Sales load is normally divided into front-end sales load and back-end sales load. Front End Sales Loads:   These are fees that an investor must pay at the time of investment. Also, categorized as "Sales Charge (Load) on Purchases," these are charges an investor pays while purchasing a fund. The front-end sales load is deducted from the actual invested amount, and the remaining portion is actually used to buy funds. Back-End Sales Loads:   These are fees that an investor must pay while selling the investments. Categorized as the "Deferred Sales Charge (Load)," these fees are deducted while redeeming fund shares. The advantage of back-end sales load over front-end sales load is that the entire capital (minus other charges) is invested at the time of purchases. The sales load here is calculated off the initial investment made and not based on the ultimate fund value. Comparative Analysis of No-Load Funds Here, we have compared the average one-year annualized returns of the top 200 no-load funds, with the top 200 load funds. Of the total 768 Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) non-load funds, the top 200 registered average one-year annualized returns of 24.6%, whereas from 263 Zacks Rank #1 load funds, the top 200 posted average one-year annualized returns of 13.2%.With no-load funds registering comparatively better returns than load funds in the past year, no-load funds are expected to get more love from investors in the near future. 4 Zacks Rank #1 No-Load Funds to Buy Now We have highlighted four no-load mutual funds flaunting a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Moreover, these funds have encouraging one-year annualized returns. Additionally, the minimum initial investment is within $5000 and net assets are above $50 million.We expect these funds to outperform their peers in the future.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe market got the new trading week started on the same bearish foot it ended last week on, though Monday's loss of 1.97% was bigger than Friday's. Still, the volume behind yesterday's pullback was lighter than Friday's … an encouraging sign that conviction in the weakness is light.Computer technology giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) led the sizeable rout of the tech sector. The former fell 7.7% while the latter slumped 9.6% for no particular reason other than investors are rethinking overwhelming bullishness that had driven them sharply higher through September.Not every name was in the red on Monday, however. Opko Health (NASDAQ: OPK ) was up 20.5% on surprisingly strong third-quarter numbers . There simply weren't nearly enough names like Opko to fend off the overwhelming number of bears.Regardless, a handful of stocks looks positioned to do what they're going to do no matter what the overall market does. Stock charts of Scana (NYSE: SCG ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG ) are a trio of such names.If you're looking for the biggest reason the broad market sold off today, start your search with Apple. Shares of the consumer-tech giant fell more than 5%, setting the tone and pace for every other name. Worse, AAPL shares are now at a critical make-or-break support line.That's hardly a guarantee of a meltdown. Indeed, there are a couple of good reasons to plan on a bounce here. It's going to take one or two days to see which direction traders intend to take things. If the plan is to take Apple lower though, there's not much hope for support anywhere near its current low.Back in late July , shares of utility company Scana were working their way out of a slump and putting new bullish pressure on their 200-day moving average line. It looked like the foundation for a prolonged bullish move. SCG never got over that hump in a convincing way, however, instead pulling back quite a bit in August.The underpinnings for a breakout move never really went away though. Indeed, the pullback and subsequent rebound effort may have actually laid a better bullish foundation from which to launch.Last but not least, Procter & Gamble shares have been on a big tear of late, gaining 16% from their mid-October low. And as of Monday, PG stock has pushed above a major technical ceiling, and it did so on strong volume.It may well be a clue that the stock is going to be catapulted upward at an even stronger pace. If that's going to happen though, it's a move that's going to have to defy a rather severe overbought condition and break past another big-time technical resistance level. If that happens though, look out above.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Just as tech stocks rebounded in November from the worst sell-offs in early October mainly due to rising rate and overvaluation concerns, a slump in Apple Inc AAPL shares again caused a rout in the tech space. Apple was down more than 5% on Nov 12, the lowest in more than three months . It lost about 0.7% after hours.The company's the main supplier for its Face ID technology, Lumentum Holdings Inc. LITE , cut its revenue and profit forecasts due to lower orders from a major customer . Apprehending that this customer could only be Apple, panic spread across the market. Lumentum stock plunged about 33% on Nov 12.Another supplier, Japan Display, a supplier of liquid crystal display screens for iPhones, cut its full-year guidance on "volatile customer demand" on Nov 12. Japan Display shares dived 7.6% on Nov 13 to a record low, as quoted on Financial Times.Apple Guided Lower in Earnings SeasonInvestors should note that Apple guided lower in its last earnings release. The gadget-maker foresees revenues in the range of $89-$93 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The midpoint is below the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $91.32 billion.On its earnings call, Apple said that the company will no longer report individual sales numbers for iPhone, iPad and Mac starting next quarter. The three main product lines will be wrapped into one reported revenue figure (read: Apple Beats, Guides Lower: ETFs in Focus ).Chip Stocks in the RedSuch downbeat guidance hit other suppliers hard, crushing chip stock makers. Asia's Apple assemblers Pegatron and Hong Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn, dropped 5.7% and 2.6%, respectively, in Taipei, while Wistron fell 3.7% , according to Financial Times. Laragan Precision, which makes camera lenses for iPhones retreated as much as 5.7% and chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Company dropped 3.7% on Tuesday, according to Financial Times.IMF said that the smartphone-driven tech cycle had probably topped in  late 2015 . Now,  saturation in demand  in developed markets and lengthening of upgrade cycles are weighing on overall smartphone sales.This is not the first time that concerns over waning demand for iPhones have risen. Such fears had also cropped up in June. All in all, fears of demand for iPhones peaking made the tech sector go into a tailspin on Nov 12 (read: Apple's iPhone Order Cut Report May Hurt These ETFs ).Below we highlight a few ETF areas that may be troubled if demand for iPhones continues to trend lower.Apple ETFsETFs which have considerable exposure to Apple may thus underperform. These funds include  iShares U.S. Technology ETF IYW (down 3.4% on Nov 12), Select Sector SPDR Technology ETF XLK (down 3.5%) and  Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT (down 3.4%) (see  all Technology ETFs  here).Semiconductor ETFsApple's suppliers, meaning several semiconductors companies should bear the brunt of it.VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH (down 4.4% on Nov 12 and has lost another 4.4% after hours), SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETFXSD (down 5% opn Nov 12),  iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETFSOXX (down 4.5% on Nov 12) and  PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors ETFPSI (down 4.6% on Nov 12) should be on high alert.Taiwan ETFThe fate of pure-play Taiwan ETF,  iShares MSCI Taiwan ETF EWT (down 1.3% on Nov12), is often related to Apple.

  (RTTNews.com) - Qorvo Inc. (QRVO), a supplier for Apple Inc. (AAPL), Tuesday cut its third-quarter forecast for profit and revenue, becoming the latest supplier for the iPhone maker to have lowered its outlook due to lower demand from a major customer. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter is now expected to be $1.70 per share at the midpoint of guidance, compared to the previous forecast of $1.95. Qorvo, a provider of innovative RF chips, said it now expects third-quarter revenues of $800 million and $840 million, down from its previous forecast of $880 million to $900 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters currently expect earnings of $1.95 per share and revenues of $892.72 million. The company said the change in outlook was due to recent demand changes for flagship smartphones. Qorvo's forecast of demand from China-based handset manufacturers remains measured and largely unchanged. Apple had said its holiday season quarter sales would miss Wall Street expectations, largely due to weakness in emerging markets and foreign exchange costs. Lumentum, one of the suppliers Apple uses for its facial recognition and augmented reality technology, Monday said it received a request from one of its largest suppliers to reduce its shipments. Although, the company did not reveal the name of its "largest supplier", the news prompted concerns that the latest iPhones may not be in huge demand into the holiday season. Japan Display Inc., which supplies screens for the iPhone XR, cut earnings estimates for its fiscal year ending in March. It said orders for its latest LCD panels would be much lower than its initial expectations for the three months ending in March. For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com

Is Fidelity High Dividend ETF (FDVV) a Hot ETF Right Now?
 The Fidelity High Dividend ETF (FDVV) made its debut on 09/12/2016, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs category of the market. What Are Smart Beta ETFs? Products that are based on market cap weighted indexes, which are strategies designed to reflect a specific market segment or the market as a whole, have traditionally dominated the ETF industry.Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.However, some investors believe in the possibility of beating the market through exceptional stock selection, and choose a different type of fund that tracks non-cap weighted strategies: smart beta.This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.

 Chip giant   Intel    (NASDAQ: INTC) has been having solid success with its cellular   modem chip efforts over the last several years, as it scored some   of   Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone modem orders in 2016 and became the   exclusive supplier of modems for this year's   latest iPhones    with its first gigabit LTE modem, known as the   XMM 7560    .A little while back,   Fast Company    reported that Apple will be using Intel's upcoming   XMM 8160 5G modem     inside of its first 5G iPhones that'll launch in 2020.  Image source: Intel.On Nov. 12, Intel announced that it will be pulling in the   launch of the XMM 8160 and also disclosed key details of the   device. Let's take a look at what the chip giant had to say.Intel said in a news release that it's "pulling in the launch   by more than a half-year."The chip giant claims that the modem will be "available in the   second half of 2019 and will deliver the features and experiences   to accelerate widespread 5G adoption."While the company will be shipping the modems in the second   half of 2019, Intel says that devices incorporating the modem   "including phones, PCs and broadband access gateways are expected   to be available in the first half of 2020."The timing of this news release is interesting since   Fast Company    reported that Apple "has been unhappy with Intel lately," stating   that "[the] most likely reason relates to the challenge of   solving heat dissipation issues caused by the [XMM] 8060 modem   chip."I wouldn't be surprised if this news release from Intel was   intended to reassure investors that the development of the modem   that's supposed to power Apple's first 5G iPhones is on track in   light of the   Fast Company    report.Apple, the main buyer of Intel's cellular modems, typically   announces new iPhones in September -- well into the second half   of a given year. If the XMM 8160 is available to customers in the   second half of 2019, then it should be out with plenty of time to   spare to support Apple's 2020 iPhone launches.Intel says that the XMM 8160 "will support peak speeds of up   to 6 gigabits per second, making it three to six times faster   than the latest LTE modems available today."For some additional context, Intel's currently shipping XMM   7560 supports download speeds "exceeding 1 [gigabits per   second]," according to the company, and Intel's upcoming LTE   modem, known as the XMM 7660, supports download speeds of "up to   1.6 [gigabits per second]."So, the XMM 8160 should be a huge jump in peak download   capabilities compared to Intel's current and upcoming LTE   modems.Intel also explains that the XMM 8160 is a "multimode modem,   meaning it will support the new standard for 5G New Radio (NR),   including stand-alone (SA) and non-stand-alone (NSA) modes, as   well as 4G, 3G and 2G legacy radios in a single chipset."Although Intel has now announced the timing and features of   the XMM 8160, it didn't say what chip manufacturing technology it   would be built on in its press release. According to   Fast Company    , it'll be manufactured using Intel's 10nm technology, the   successor to the 14nm technology that's used to build Intel's   current XMM 7560 and will be used to craft the upcoming XMM   7660.

  (RTTNews.com) - Apple Inc. (AAPL), the first company to reach $1 trillion market valuation, has lost the coveted status after its stock slipped further after couple of iPhone suppliers cut their outlook, which saw the tech giant lose $190 billion of its valuation. Shares of Apple dropped after two key suppliers for iPhones cut their earnings projections for coming months raising concerns for sales and demand for new iPhones. Apple is still the world's most valuable publicly traded company, with a market capitalization of $917.29 billion. Shares of Apple are currently trading at $193.37, down $0.80 or 0.41%. Over the past one month, Apple has lost over $190 billion in value. Apple had reached the trillion-dollar milestone on August 2 and was also joined one month later by Amazon. Lumentum, one of the suppliers Apple uses for its facial recognition and augmented reality technology, Monday said it received a request from one of its largest suppliers to reduce its shipments. Although, the company did not reveal the name of its "largest supplier", the news prompted concerns that the latest iPhones may not be in huge demand into the holiday season. Japan Display Inc., which supplies screens for the iPhone XR, cut earnings estimates for its fiscal year ending in March. It said orders for its latest LCD panels would be much lower than its initial expectations for the three months ending in March. During Apple's fourth-quarter earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company would no longer report the number of units it has sold of any product in future earnings reports. According to CNBC, Goldman Sachs estimates Apple will produce 6 percent fewer iPhones next year than previously expected after key supplier Lumentum reduced its shipment outlook. "We are concerned that end demand for new iPhone models is deteriorating," Goldman said in the note. "We note this could easily right itself given the bulk of demand comes in late December but we feel more prudent sell through forecasts are warranted due to the timing and magnitude of this warning." Goldman has a neutral rating on Apple and lowered its price target on the company's stock to $209 a share from $222 a share, the report says. For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com 
Asian Stock Markets Retreat; Hong Kong and Shanghai Higher On Trade Outlook
Asian stock markets opened lower Tuesday on Wall Street cues and retreated on smartphone and tech-sector softness, but Hong Kong and Shanghai gained on reports that Chinese vice premier Liu He will visit Washington DC soon to prepare another round of Sino-US trade talks. In Sydney, traders complained that the Australian market, which fell 1.80%, has been "sold off on weak iPhone prospects."In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 opened lower on overnight Wall Street cues and could not regain ground, as the tech sector slipped despite a softer yen. Suppliers to Apple ( AAPL  ) were hit on concerns the smartphone sector is too crowded. The Japanese currency fell to more than 114 to the greenback, regarded as a positive in export-oriented Japan.The benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped 459.36, or 2.06%, to 21,810.52, as losing issues outnumbered gainers 214 to 11.Leading the thin upside on a down day were CyberAgent (CYGIY, 4751:Tokyo), up 2.2%, followed by finance-tech shop SoftBank (SFTBY, 9984:Tokyo), up 1.9%, and then textile-house Toyobo (TYOBY, 3101:Tokyo), up 1.2%.On the downside were engineering concern Taiyo Yuden (TYOYY, 6976:Tokyo), off 7.3%, and then Mitsui Mining & Smelting (MMSMY, 5706;Tokyo), off 6.6%.The Bank of Japan now owns assets worth more than the country's annual GDP, following a half-decade of quantitative easing.However, with Japan's consumer prices rising at about 1% annually, the Bank of Japan has yet to hit its 2% inflation target.The Hong Kong Hang Seng opened lower on Wall Street cues and tech-sector softness, but rallied in the afternoon on the news of the pending trade-meeting between Washington and Beijing.The broad gauge Hang Seng rose 159.69, or 0.62%, to 25,792.87.Leading the upside were Geely Automotive (175:HK), up 4.7%, followed by Macau gaming-house Galaxy Entertainment (27:HK), up 3.2%, and then China Mengniu Daory (2319:HK), up 2.9%.On the downside were oil drillers CNOOC (8831:HK), off 3.1%, and then PetroChina (857:HK), off 1.3%.On the mainland, the Shanghai Composite rose 0.93% to 2,654.88.China exports to the US are growing due to a strong American economy and consumer preference for Sino products, the state ministry of commerce said. The delivery of previously placed orders and front-loading by Chinese exporters also contributed to a robust performance in 2018.On the other exchanges, the S. Korean Kospi declined 0.44%; the Taiwan TWSE fell 0.56%; the Singapore Straits Times Index lost 0.47%; but the Thai Set inclined 0.30%. In late trading in Mumbai, the Sensex was up 0.96%.
 By Sruthi Shankar Nov 13 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday as technology stocks bounced back after a steep selloff in the previous session and hopes of progress in the U.S.-China trade talks boosted industrials, even though a decline in Apple Inc  curbed gains. The S&P technology index  rose 0.6 percent following three days of losses, but shares of Apple edged 1.3 percent lower, entering its fourth day in the red.  The trade-sensitive industrial sector  rose 0.5 percent, boosted by shares of Caterpillar Inc  and United Technologies Corp. "It seems like some pressure regarding trade has been alleviated," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. "However, the market will take a defensive posture until visibility increases with regard to trade." The development comes as China President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump plan to meet on the sidelines of a G20 summit that is being held in Argentina at the end of November. The main indexes tumbled in the previous session on Monday as shares of Apple slid 5 percent after several suppliers to the iPhone maker cut their forecasts, signaling that demand for the phones could be softening. Following that, Goldman Sachs cut its earnings estimate for Apple and another key supplier Foxconn, reported a weaker-than-expected rise in quarterly profit.  After a stellar rally for technology shares that has fueled a decade-long gain for U.S. stocks, appetite for the group has started to wane lately on concerns about tighter regulation and demand for chipmakers. Allocation to the global tech sector collapsed to the lowest since February 2009, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey that also showed the S&P 500 index was broadly expected to rise 12 percent more before peaking.  At 10:01 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was down 54.28 points, or 0.21 percent, at 25,332.90, the S&P 500  was up 4.76 points, or 0.17 percent, at 2,730.98 and the Nasdaq Composite  was up 14.96 points, or 0.21 percent, at 7,215.83. The Dow was weighed down by shares of Home Depot Inc, which reversed course to fall 0.9 percent following the No.1 home improvement chain's results. Boeing Co's  shares also fell 3.5 percent.  Nine of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, but the energy index  was lower as oil prices fell more than 2 percent and utilities sector.  also declined. Advance Auto Parts Inc  rose 8.9 percent after the company raised full-year sales forecast and reported better-than-expected third-quarter results.  Meat processor Tyson Foods Inc  fell 6 percent after its fourth-quarter revenue fell short of Wall Street estimates, hit by lower demand for chicken.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 1.89-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.95-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 4 new 52-week highs and seven new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 6 new highs and 54 new lows.

Amazon picks New York City, Washington D.C. area for new offices
 By Jeffrey Dastin and David Shepardson SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc  picked America's financial and political capitals for massive new offices on Tuesday, branching out from its home base in Seattle with plans to create more than 25,000 jobs in both New York City and an area just outside Washington, D.C. The world's largest online retailer plans to spend $5 billion on the two new developments in Long Island City and Arlington, Virginia, and expects to get more than $2 billion in tax credits and incentives with plans to apply for more. Losers said they learned from the process, while winners said it was costly but worthwhile.  "Either you are creating jobs or you are losing jobs," New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told a news conference on Tuesday. With more than 610,000 workers worldwide, Amazon is already one of the biggest employers in the United States and the world's third-most valuable company, behind Apple Inc  and Microsoft Corp. Still, it faces fierce competition for talent from Alphabet Inc'sGoogle and other companies working to build new technologies in the cloud. Those rivals routinely offer free food and perks in sunny California, seen by many as a better draw than Amazon's relative frugality in rain-plagued Seattle. Google also has a growing footprint in New York City. Already marketing its forthcoming location in the New York City borough of Queens, Amazon talked up Long Island City's breweries, waterfront parks and easy transit access. Rents there are typically lower than in Midtown Manhattan, which is just across the East River. The former industrial area also has a clock counting down the hours until the end of U.S. President Donald Trump's first term in office. The choice of Arlington, Virginia, just across the Potomac River from downtown Washington D.C., could hand Amazon greater political influence in the U.S. capital, where it has one of the largest lobbying shops in town. Locating close to the Pentagon may also help Amazon win a $10 billion cloud-computing contract from the U.S. Department of Defense, said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive and the world's richest person, privately owns the Washington Post, which has written critical articles about Trump. In turn, Bezos's companies have been a frequent target of broadsides from the president. The newspaper maintains full editorial independence from its owner. Amazon's choice largely bypassed the middle of the United States, where many cities had hoped for an economic boost and bid for the new jobs. The company already had large corporate workforces in greater Washington and New York. "My heart is broken today," Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said. 
 TAX BREAKS At the outset of its search last year, Amazon said it was looking for a business-friendly environment. The company said it will receive performance-based incentives of $1.525 billion from the state of New York, including an average $48,000 for each job it creates. It can also apply for other tax incentives, such as New York City's Relocation and Employment Assistance Program that offers tax breaks potentially worth $900 million over 12 years. What benefit the company would actually get was unclear. In Virginia, Amazon will receive performance-based incentives of $573 million, including an average $22,000 for each job it creates. These rewards come on top of $1.6 billion in subsidies Amazon has received across the United States since 2000, according to a database from the Washington-based watchdog Good Jobs First. Amazon says it has invested $160 billion in the country since 2010 and that the new offices will generate more than $14 billion in extra tax revenue for New York, Virginia and Tennessee over the next two decades. It expects an average wage of more than $150,000 for employees in each new office. 
 HOUSING CRISIS Amazon's emphasis on new, high-paying jobs earned publicity as it faced criticism for low wages in its sprawling warehouses. The company got $148 million worth of media attention across the English-language press in the two months following the launch of its search last September, according to media measurement and analytics firm mediaQuant Inc. Amazon received 238 proposals and New York and Virginia beat out 18 other finalists from a January short list, which included Los Angeles and Chicago.  New Jersey made headlines early in the contest by proposing $7 billion in potential credits against state and city taxes if Amazon located in Newark and stuck to hiring commitments. Others with less money to offer took a more creative approach: the mayor of the Atlanta suburb of Stonecrest, Jason Lary, said he would create a new city from industrial land called Amazon and name Bezos its mayor for life. In evaluating its options, Amazon looked at the quality of schools, meeting with superintendents to discuss education in science and math. Amazon also wanted helicopter landing pads for the new sites, documents it released on Tuesday show. The company has already had to navigate community issues at its more than 45,000-person urban campus in Seattle. An affordable housing crisis there prompted the city council to adopt a head tax on businesses in May, which Amazon helped overturn in a subsequent city council vote.  Some critics had pushed for more transparency from cities and states in the bidding process, warning that the benefits of hosting a massive Amazon office may not offset the taxpayer-funded incentives and other costs. "Our subways are crumbling, our children lack school seats, and too many of our neighbors lack adequate health care," New York State Senator Michael Gianaris and City Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer said in a joint statement. "It is unfathomable that we would sign a $3 billion check to Amazon in the face of these challenges."

Amazon picks New York City, Washington D.C. area for $5 bln new headquarters
 By Jeffrey Dastin and David Shepardson SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc  picked America's financial and political capitals for massive new offices on Tuesday, branching out from its home base in Seattle with plans to create more than 25,000 jobs in both New York City and an area just outside Washington, D.C. The world's largest online retailer plans to spend $5 billion on the two new developments in Long Island City and Arlington, Virginia, and expects to get more than $2 billion in tax credits and incentives with plans to apply for more. Losers said they learned from the process, while winners said it was costly but worthwhile.  "Either you are creating jobs or you are losing jobs," New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told a news conference on Tuesday. With more than 610,000 workers worldwide, Amazon is already one of the biggest employers in the United States and the world's third-most valuable company, behind Apple Inc  and Microsoft Corp. Still, it faces fierce competition for talent from Alphabet Inc'sGoogle and other companies working to build new technologies in the cloud. Those rivals routinely offer free food and perks in sunny California, seen by many as a better draw than Amazon's relative frugality in rain-plagued Seattle. Google also has a growing footprint in New York City. Already marketing its forthcoming location in the New York City borough of Queens, Amazon talked up Long Island City's breweries, waterfront parks and easy transit access. Rents there are typically lower than in Midtown Manhattan, which is just across the East River. The former industrial area also has a clock counting down the hours until the end of U.S. President Donald Trump's first term in office. The choice of Arlington, Virginia, just across the Potomac River from downtown Washington D.C., could hand Amazon greater political influence in the U.S. capital, where it has one of the largest lobbying shops in town. Locating close to the Pentagon may also help Amazon win a $10 billion cloud-computing contract from the U.S. Department of Defense, said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive and the world's richest person, privately owns the Washington Post, which has written critical articles about Trump. In turn, Bezos's companies have been a frequent target of broadsides from the president. The newspaper maintains full editorial independence from its owner. Amazon's choice largely bypassed the middle of the United States, where many cities had hoped for an economic boost and bid for the new jobs. The company already had large corporate workforces in greater Washington and New York. "My heart is broken today," Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said. 
 TAX BREAKS At the outset of its search last year, Amazon said it was looking for a business-friendly environment. The company said it will receive performance-based incentives of $1.525 billion from the state of New York, including an average $48,000 for each job it creates. It can also apply for other tax incentives, such as New York City's Relocation and Employment Assistance Program that offers tax breaks potentially worth $900 million over 12 years. What benefit the company would actually get was unclear. In Virginia, Amazon will receive performance-based incentives of $573 million, including an average $22,000 for each job it creates. These rewards come on top of $1.6 billion in subsidies Amazon has received across the United States since 2000, according to a database from the Washington-based watchdog Good Jobs First. Amazon says it has invested $160 billion in the country since 2010 and that the new offices will generate more than $14 billion in extra tax revenue for New York, Virginia and Tennessee over the next two decades. It expects an average wage of more than $150,000 for employees in each new office. 
 HOUSING CRISIS Amazon's emphasis on new, high-paying jobs earned publicity as it faced criticism for low wages in its sprawling warehouses. The company got $148 million worth of media attention across the English-language press in the two months following the launch of its search last September, according to media measurement and analytics firm mediaQuant Inc. Amazon received 238 proposals and New York and Virginia beat out 18 other finalists from a January short list, which included Los Angeles and Chicago.  New Jersey made headlines early in the contest by proposing $7 billion in potential credits against state and city taxes if Amazon located in Newark and stuck to hiring commitments. Others with less money to offer took a more creative approach: the mayor of the Atlanta suburb of Stonecrest, Jason Lary, said he would create a new city from industrial land called Amazon and name Bezos its mayor for life. In evaluating its options, Amazon looked at the quality of schools, meeting with superintendents to discuss education in science and math. Amazon also wanted helicopter landing pads for the new sites, documents it released on Tuesday show. The company has already had to navigate community issues at its more than 45,000-person urban campus in Seattle. An affordable housing crisis there prompted the city council to adopt a head tax on businesses in May, which Amazon helped overturn in a subsequent city council vote.  Some critics had pushed for more transparency from cities and states in the bidding process, warning that the benefits of hosting a massive Amazon office may not offset the taxpayer-funded incentives and other costs.

 Nov 13 (Reuters) - Apple supplier Qorvo Inc  cut its third-quarter forecast for profit and revenue on Tuesday, joining a handful of suppliers to the iPhone maker that have warned of an earnings  hit due to lower demand from a major customer. Qorvo, which supplies radio frequency chips to Apple, said the forecast cut was due to "recent demand changes for flagship smartphones." Analysts told Reuters on Monday that the "unnamed customer" the suppliers are blaming for their forecast cut is Apple.  Lumentum Holdings Inc, the main supplier of the Face ID technology in the latest generation of iPhones, cut $70 million off its forecasts for revenue on Monday. Screen maker Japan Display Inc  cited lower smartphone demand in cutting its own outlook, while British chipmaker IQE Plc  also said it expects a material reduction in its financial performance in the current year. Qorvo currently expects third quarter revenue in the range of $800 million to $840 million, down from its previous forecast of $880 million to $900 million. Shares of Qorvo fell 2.3 percent, while Apple was down nearly 1 percent in early trading. 
 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Alphabet, General motors, Apple and PayPal
  For Immediate Release Chicago, IL -November 13, 2018 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet GOOGL  , General motors GM  , Apple AAPL  and PayPal PYPL  . Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog:   Alphabet Roundup: Way More Than Just Waymo  Alphabet has a ton of problems related to privacy, anticompetitive behavior and now, employee unrest. While the company gives the impression that employee-related concerns are under control, it remains a problem trend worth watching. Amidst these concerns is the good news that Waymo is closer to commercialization, mobile search is getting a new interface through "Discover" and pictures are getting easier to understand through "Lens." Here are a few details- Waymo Closer to Commercialization The company appears well ahead of other players in the space including General motors and Apple based on the 7 billion simulated test miles and 10 million miles its cars have actually ridden on public roads. The company is currently adding around a million miles every month.The large number of miles along with the relatively small number of mishaps its vehicles have been involved in are perhaps the reasons it has become the first of around 60 companies testing the technology in California to receive a permit from the state's Department of Motor Vehicles to test driverless vehicles without a backup driver in the front seat.Waymo is moving toward the commercialization of the ride hailing service built around its self-driving cars. The company has indicated in the past that its commercialization efforts would begin by the year's end and on the last earnings call it was confirmed that the process has kicked off. So some of the early riders that were testing the service for free within a limited area in Phoenix are now helping the company decide on a pricing model. Testing continues in other cities like Mountain View, California and Austin.Last month, Waymo CEO John Krafcik told Roadshow that the Waymo trips would eventually cost as much as an equivalent Uber or Lyft ride but that the company was looking at other ways to make the service more attractive. "Businesses are saying to some of the users 'Hey, we'll pay Waymo to bring you to the mall, or to this destination, or to the hotel.'" Krafcik told Roadshow. "I think this is a really interesting future business possibility for Waymo," he said. in a recent interview with Condé Nast Traveler he said, "It will enable more people to try the technology more quickly when you can buy just a little slice of transportation for $6." ARK has estimated that robo-taxis might cost 35 cents per mile, include 5 cents to cover the cost of remote operators who monitor the vehicles and intervene when something goes wrong, the Financial Times reports. Google Discover The Google Home page on mobile has just become a place that you can use to discover new stuff related to your interests without so much as typing a word. It's essentially a Google feed of the things you're accustomed to searching online and is proof of how well Google knows you and the level of your knowledge on any topic.Its blog post from September says for instance that "Discover can predict your level of expertise on a topic and help you further develop those interests. If you're learning to play guitar, for example, you might see beginner content about learning chords. If you're already a skilled musician, you may see a video on more advanced techniques."If you aren't freaked out already and want to give Google even more information about yourself, you can further customize the feed to show more or less of the things it surfaces.If you are freaked out, you can disable the service. But for the record, Google says there are already 800 million people using it every month. Google Lens Integrated with Google Photos, Google Assistant and the native Android camera app, Google Lens uses artificial intelligence to tell you more about the images in Google Photos. It can recognize items in a picture that you may want to buy, or tell you about a book or record that you have a picture of, or about monuments and other points of interest when you're on travel, or even translate text that you photograph into a language you understand. All you need to do is circle the item you want information about and/or touch the dots on it after tapping the lens icon.Needless to say, Lens will get better over time, as it gathers more information about people, places and things.The feature was first launched in the U.S. for Pixel phones in the English language, then expanded to all phones using Photos and Google says it will soon be rolled out to other languages and geographies. Ethos Investment In a funding round led by Accel Partners in Google Ventures-backed life insurance application processor Ethos, the startup raised $35 million. The company, which says it can process applications in about 10 minutes instead of the usual 10 weeks, while eliminating the need for a medical exam or blood test, has now raised $46 million, taking its total valuation to a $100 million.Following the investment, Accel Partner Nate Niparko will join the firm's board of directors, while Google Ventures General Partner Tyson Clark will act as an advisor to the board. Sequoia Capital and VC Arrive also participated.The company says it saw a 400% jump in revenue, customers and applications in the last four months. Employee Activism The #metoo movement that doesn't require anyone to prove anything legally but allows complete liberty to women to accuse men of sexual misconduct is catching on. Unfortunately, the first company in Silicon Valley to be hit was Google, despite the fact that it has always given its employees a lot of voice and liberties.What sparked the unrest involving around 20,000 employees across the world was a New York Times article that blamed the company for paying the father of Android Andy Rubin a $90 million exit package while knowing there were reasons to believe that he had engaged in sexual misconduct. Rubin denied the charge while also claiming that the NYT number that Google hasn't refuted was a gross exaggeration.CEO Pichai has since said that the company was taking an increasingly hard line on such accusations and had fired 48 people, including 13 senior managers, in the last two years while denying them their exit packages. He has also said that Google is considering constructive ideas from employees to improve its hiring and management processes.One of these is likely the mandatory arbitration clause that is included in company policies to reduce cost, force quick settlement and keep the whole thing quiet. Google and other tech companies are doing away with this clause, which will help employees go to court and also appeal verdicts.It's quite an alarming trend when a company can deny you promised pay based on accusations that haven't been proved in court and it's hard to say where this will lead. At any rate it's a new flavor of arm twisting in an industry that has seen only a limited amount of trade unionism for tamer things like better pay and benefits. India During the Money20/20 financial-technology conference in Las Vegas, payments general manager and head of its "next billion users" initiative Caesar Sengupta said that Google Pay has more than 30 million monthly active users in India, generating payment volume at a $40 billion annual run rate.The Indian version of Google Pay is built on the country's Unified Payments Interface, a government-approved payment technology that uses email addresses for identity verification rather than traditional bank-account information.Google Pay is a much better option than PayPal in the country where most phones run on Android and use a plethora of payments services, many of which are local.

 By Sruthi Shankar Nov 13 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures rose on Tuesday, as strong earnings from Home Depot Inc  and a rebound in technology stocks put Wall Street on track to end a three-day run of losses. Shares of Home Depot rose 3.5 percent in premarket trading after the No.1 home improvement chain reported a better-than-expected rise in sales at established U.S. stores.  Wage pressures could increasingly be an issue as earnings growth for S&P 500 companies is expected to slow to about 9 percent next year following 2018's tax-fueled gains, estimated at 24 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. At 7:19 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis  were up 161 points, or 0.63 percent. S&P 500 e-minis  were up 19 points, or 0.7 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis  were up 63.25 points, or 0.93 percent. The main indexes tumbled on Monday as shares of Apple Inc  slid 5 percent after several suppliers to the iPhone maker cut their forecasts, signaling that demand for iPhones could be softening. Apple's shares edged lower on Tuesday. A key supplier and contract electronics maker, Foxconn, reported a weaker-than-expected rise in quarterly profit.  Other tech and internet giants including Alphabet Inc, Amazon.com Inc  and Netflix Inc  rose more than 1 percent in premarket trading following sharp losses on Monday. After a stellar rally for technology shares that has fueled a decade-long gain for U.S. stocks, appetite for the group has started to wane lately on concerns about tighter regulation and demand for chipmakers. Allocation to the global tech sector collapsed to the lowest since February 2009, with just 18 percent of investors saying they were overweight on the sector, Bank of America Merrill Lynch's investor survey showed.  The survey also showed U.S. remains the most favored equity region for global fund managers despite recent market wobbles, with the S&P 500 index broadly expected to rise 12 percent more before peaking. A report that China's top trade negotiator was preparing to visit the United States before a meeting between the leaders of the world's two largest economies helped early trading. Oil prices fell more than 2 percent after U.S. President Donald Trump put pressure on OPEC not to cut supply to prop up the market.  Among other stocks, Advance Auto Parts Inc  rose 4.2 percent after the auto parts maker raised full-year sales forecast and reported better-than-expected third-quarter results. Tyson Foods Inc  fell 3.4 percent after fourth-quarter revenue fell short of Wall Street estimates.  
 
 TAIPEI, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Taiwan'sFoxconn, the world's top contract electronics maker and a key Apple  supplier, posted an 18.3 percent rise in third-quarter net profit on Tuesday.

Trade optimism, soft dollar support FX, stocks
 By Agamoni Ghosh Nov 13 (Reuters) - A tepid dollar and hopes of progress in the U.S.-China trade dispute helped emerging-market currencies gain on Tuesday, while stocks recovered from earlier losses as U.S. futures pointed to a higher open on Wall Street after its sell-off overnight. The MSCI emerging currency index  was steady after reports that China and U.S. resumed high-level discussions and the dollar retreated from highs reached on the Federal Reserve's hawkish stance and weakness in European currencies.  "Whenever we get these small hints that there are some positive signs from the trade war, it is of course positive for both emerging-market currencies and stocks" said Morten Lund, an analyst at Nordea Markets. The Chinese yuan  scored its biggest intraday gain in a week, as major state-owned banks stepped in to pull the currency from near-decade lows.  The South African rand  snapped a three-day losing streak to rise by 0.1 percent, in line with stocks, which rose 0.26 percent. The Russian rouble  rose as exporters bought the currency to make monthly tax payments due November 15. The Indian rupee  and Philippine peso  benefited from falling oil prices. Brent crude slid below $70 per barrel after Trump put pressure on OPEC not to cut supply. The Turkish lira  extended losses after the country's current account surplus came in below forecasts on Monday.  The emerging-market stock index  inched higher as most stocks pared losses, led by mainland China equities,, which closed higher for a second straight session. Other Asian markets trimmed losses after tracking a sell-off on Wall Street overnight. Apple shares fell after several suppliers to the company cut their forecasts.  "We have Japan closing off lows and more importantly S&P futures coming back from being down," said Kay Van-Petersen, a global macros strategist at Saxo Markets. Stocks in Turkey  and India  rose between 0.8 percent and 1 percent. But Apple's  supplier worries weighed on both Taiwanese  and South Korean stocks, which fell between 0.4 to 0.6 percent. The Polish zloty  snapped a two-day losing streak  after the central bank said it expects the currency to strengthen and gradually approach equilibrium.  Other Eastern European currencies remained little changed.

Apple-supplier IQE trims full-year earnings outlook
 Nov 13 (Reuters) - Apple supplier IQE  on Tuesday said it expects full-year core earnings to be about 16.4 percent lower from a year ago after a major chipmaker in the 3D sensing technology supply chain reported a reduction in orders. IQE, which had warned on full-year results on Monday, said it now expects to earn about 31 million pounds ($39.92 million), after one of the chipmaker's largest customers said it would "materially reduce" shipments for the current quarter.  U.S.-based Lumentum Holdings Inc, the main supplier of the Face ID technology used in the latest iPhones, cut $70 million off its revenue forecast on Monday.  Shares of IQE, which closed down nearly 29 percent on Monday, are currently up about 4 percent. "We remain convinced we are still at the foothills of the opportunity, and given the share price reaction yesterday, remain positive on IQE's medium- to longer-term value upside," Peel Hunt said in a report on Tuesday. Shares of many Asian suppliers and assemblers fell on Tuesday, leading some market watchers to call the peak for iPhones in several key markets.

This iPhone XR Shortcoming Is Good News for 1 Apple Supplier
  Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL) flagship iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max share a   lot of similarities with its lower-cost   iPhone XR    model. They all use the same screaming-fast   A12 Bionic    applications processors, incorporate identical TrueDepth camera   systems for Face ID and features like Animoji, and share the same   rear-facing wide-angle cameras.Teardown reports from iFixit also reveal that all three   smartphones use the same   Intel    (NASDAQ: INTC)    XMM 7560 LTE modem    . Despite this fact, though, Apple markets the higher-end devices   as capable of gigabit LTE speeds, while the iPhone XR can only   deliver "LTE Advanced" speeds.  Image source: Apple.  PC Magazine     tested the devices and said that "[the] iPhone XS and XS Max   speed past the XR in our most recent signal test results, showing   that XR downloads may stall while their more expensive siblings   zip along in the fast lane."Here's   PC Magazine    's explanation for part of the performance disparity:Both the XS/Max and the XR use the same modem, the new Intel     XMM7560. But the XR is missing two of the XS/Max's antenna     branches, making it a 2x2 MIMO phone versus the XS/Max's 4x4     MIMO.The difference doesn't just come down to 2x2 MIMO vs 4x4 MIMO,   however:How about where the cellular networks can't handle 4x4 MIMO?     Some cell sites around the country still run on 2x2 MIMO, and     you'd think that in those conditions, the phones would perform     equally well. You'd be wrong. It turns out that the iPhone     XS/Max get stronger performance than the XR, even when the     network itself is 2x2 MIMO.Let's look at what seems to be going on here, and how this   could benefit Apple supplier   Broadcom    (NASDAQ: AVGO) .Ahead of the launch of Apple's latest devices, analyst Romit   Shah of Nomura subsidiary Instinet claimed that for the device   that we now know as the iPhone XR, Apple would replace Broadcom's   PAD filter chip with a cheaper alternative from   Qorvo    (NASDAQ: QRVO) . That move, Shah said, "represents   approximately $100 [million] in [bill of materials] cost savings   for Apple and roughly $400 [million] revenue headwind for   Broadcom in 2H18."Broadcom CEO Hock Tan admitted on the company's Sept. 6   earnings call that because Apple had reused the RF platform from   the iPhone 8-series and iPhone X devices in the iPhone XR, this   "[creates] an opportunity for a customer to temporarily use lower   performance alternatives in selected SKUs."  (Indeed,   PC Magazine    said "[the] iPhone XR ... looks a lot more like our results from   last year's test of the iPhone X, which is also a 2x2 MIMO   phone.")However, Tan did say that "every indication we have is that   the cadence of annual platform upgrades will resume in the   upcoming 2019 smartphone generation" and that "we believe we're   very well-positioned to win back the platform."Looking even further ahead, Tan claimed that "with   5G    on the horizon, we expect this cadence of annual upgrades to   sustain." (   Fast Company    recently reported that Apple is planning to launch   5G iPhones in 2020    .)"And accordingly, we expect to see our wireless revenue   returning to double-digit growth in fiscal 2020, following a   temporary dip in fiscal 2019," Tan said.For Apple to hit the price points that it wanted to with the   iPhone XR and still achieve what it viewed as an acceptable gross   margin percentage, it needed to make some choices about how best   to cut the phone's manufacturing costs relative to the iPhone XS   or iPhone XS Max (with retail prices that start at $999 and   $1099, respectively). Clearly, management concluded that saving   money on radio frequency chips was a good move for this   generation of devices.Apple is rumored to be   keeping form factors unchanged    for the 2019 models -- which makes sense, considering how long it   kept the same basic iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus form factors   around. The iPhone XR's casing likely will become cheaper to   produce over the next year, as will the display. (Apple is likely   to reuse both in the next iPhone XR). On top of that, Apple   likely will discount this year's iPhone XR, and have it replace   the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus as its mid-range option next   year.So, between the need for cost-structure optimizations and the   desire to differentiate next year's iPhone XR from the current   one, it makes sense for Apple to give the next XR the same   cellular capabilities as its higher-end counterparts.One potential downside, though, is that it would eliminate a   point of differentiation between the iPhone XR and the successors   to the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max. With that being said, those   high-end models should still have OLED screens, stainless steel   casings and Apple's most advanced camera technology, while Apple   is likely to continue to use LCDs, aluminum casings, and   feature-reduced camera systems in the lower-priced models if   history is a guide. Apple may even add still more differentiating   features to its flagship smartphones to further encourage buyers   to spring for the top-of-the-line options.

 By Jess Macy Yu and Heekyong Yang TAIPEI/SEOUL, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Shares in Asian suppliers and assemblers for Apple Inc  fell on Tuesday after several component makers warned of weaker than expected results, leading some market watchers to call the peak for iPhones in several key markets. Following a poor forecast earlier this month, analysts and investors voiced concern over the state of Apple's business, contributing to growing worries that iPhone sales were stagnating and could hurt suppliers.  Taiwan-based assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn)  dropped more than 3 percent. Rival Pegatron Corp  fell more than 5 percent but later recouped losses. Both companies count Apple as a major customer. The world's largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, fell 2.6 percent, while Flexium Interconnect Inc  was down 1.5 percent. The Taiwan Weighted Index  was down around 1.6 percent. "Apple's iPhone weakness has been a long-term issue for the Asia supply chain," said Arthur Liao, an analyst at Fubon Research in Taipei. "For Apple, the iPhone shipment has reached its peak. For tech suppliers facing the future, they have no other big client like Apple." The Cupertino, California-based tech giant's shares fell to their lowest level in more than three months on Monday.  Last week a media report saying the iPhone maker had told its smartphone assemblers to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to its new lower-priced iPhone XR had pressured supplier stocks. Analysts said the lack of technological breakthroughs had put a cap on demand, which would persist in the coming quarters. "With no new technology in sight next year for the supply chain, this is not ideal for the companies involved," said Nicole Tu, a Taipei-based analyst at Yuanta Investment Consulting. "Up through the first half of 2019 we likely won't see any breakthrough." Lumentum on Monday slashed its profit and revenue forecast for the current quarter, while IQE warned that current-year results would be lower. Japan Display lowered both sales and margin outlook for the year as well.  
 NO CONFIDENCE Apple warned earlier this month that holiday sales would miss Wall Street expectations due to weakness in emerging markets including India and foreign-exchange costs. Among other Apple suppliers in Asia, Hong Kong-based acoustic components maker AAC Technologies Holdings Inc  slumped more than 6 percent. South Korean electronic parts suppliers Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co Ltd, Apple's supplier of multi-layer ceramic capacitors, dropped more than 5 percent, while LG Innotek Co Ltd  plunged 9.5 percent. Apple said earlier this month it would stop giving the number of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers it sold in a quarter, a closely watched metric and a key indicator of the company's success. The move led analysts to question the company's business and its share price has since dropped 12.6 percent.  "(This) indicates that the company itself is not confident about its performance at the moment," said Park Jung-hoon, a fund manager at HDC Asset Management, which owns Samsung Electronics shares. "Although Apple has positioned itself as a super-expensive handset maker providing high-end products, its strategy has not been working in emerging markets including China and India as Chinese vendors have been making iPhone-like products," he said.

 By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Asian shares pared losses on Tuesday as hopes for a de-escalation in the Sino-U.S. tariff war rose on a report that China's top trade negotiator was preparing to visit the United States ahead of a meeting between the two countries' leaders. Spreadbetters pointed to a positive start for Europe and U.S. with E-minis for the S&P 500  and the Dow  up 0.5 percent each. FTSE futures were up 0.2 percent. "This news is being perceived as a positive outcome," said Rodrigo Catril, markets strategist at National Australia Bank. "So, we have seen a broad improvement in sentiment across markets." "This is good news but there is still some caution. We obviously need more detail on it." The Australian dollar  which is often played as a liquid proxy for Chinese assets, jumped 0.6 percent to $0.7214 in late afternoon trade. Chinese shares reversed earlier losses with the blue-chip index  climbing about 1 percent. That helped lift MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  off the day's low. It was still down 0.4 percent after skidding 1.7 percent at one point. Fears of a likely peak in corporate earnings growth, softening global demand and faster rate hikes in the United States have put global investors on edge over the past month, prompting them to take money off the table before year-end. Japan's Nikkei  dived more than 2 percent, led by losses in electric machinery makers and suppliers of Apple's  iPhone parts after three suppliers issued profit warnings, sending the tech-heavy Nasdaq  slumping over 2 percent. The weakened outlook triggered a steep selloff in Asian tech firms, with shares in Japan Display  plummeting over 11 percent while Murata Manufacturing  and TDK Corp  dived as much as 8.9 percent and 8.4 percent respectively. Taiwanese companies in the iPhone supply chain such as Genius  and Hon Hai  were also deep in the red. "Market participants are gradually thinking that this technology stocks boom is going to end before long," said Yoshinori Shigemi, Japan-based global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. "We are suggesting our clients shift from any technology stocks to quality names, stocks with high return on equity and low leverage," Shigemi said, without identifying particular shares. The Asia ex-Japan index is now down nearly 17 percent this year, after a solid 33.5 percent gain in 2017, with October the worst month since mid-2015. 
 E*TRADE WAR Investor sentiment has been dented by the deepening trade battle between the United States and China, with Asian emerging markets suffering their largest monthly foreign outflows since August 2011 last month, said Khoon Goh, Singapore-based head of Asia research for ANZ Banking Group. Funds returned over the earlier part of November on hopes that U.S.-China tensions would ease, Goh noted, with the focus on this month's Trump-Xi meeting. "The outcome of the meeting will have an important influence on portfolio flows in Asia into the end of the year," Goh added. Risk assets including Asian equities have also been hurt by rising U.S. interest rates. The Federal Reserve is expected to tighten policy further in December.  In Europe, fears that Britain could crash out of the European Union without a Brexit deal and a growing rift over Italy's budget hit the euro and the pound, pushing the dollar index  against a basket of currencies to 97.693, a level not seen since mid 2017. It was last flat at 97.5.  The euro gained 0.2 percent to trade at $1.1243 on Tuesday, after tumbling more than one percent versus the dollar on Monday. The Italian government is facing a Tuesday deadline for it to submit a revised budget to the EU. Sterling  fell to $1.2825 as three straight sessions of losses took it to the lowest since Nov.1. There were still  unresolved issues with the EU over Brexit, British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Monday.  It was last up 0.3 percent at $1.2882. Oil prices hovered near multi-month lows after declining for a record 11th consecutive session amid softening demand and as Trump said he hoped there would be no oil output reductions.  U.S. crude  skidded 83 cents to $59.1 a barrel. Brent crude futures  fell 74 cents to $69.38. Spot gold  was 0.2 percent firmer at $1,203.58 per ounce.

 Shares of Home Depot HD  sunk 3.5% ahead of its quarterly earnings release Tuesday as part of a larger downturn that saw the likes of Apple AAPL  , Boeing BA  , Microsoft MSFT  , and other giants fall. HD shares had also fallen 7% over the last three months before Monday's dip. So, the question is what should investors expect from Home Depot's Q3 financial result? Overview Home Depot is the world's largest home improvement retailer and boasts 2,286 locations. The firm pulled in $100.9 billion in revenues last year, which marked a 6.7% jump from fiscal 2016.Home Depot stock has also blown away the S&P 500 over the last five years, up roughly 130% compared the S&P's 60% climb. Shares of HD have also crushed rival Lowe's LOW  86% jump.With that said, we can see that shares of Home Depot have experienced some turbulence over the last year. Home Depot stock closed regular trading at $179.43 per share Monday, down 16% from its 52-week high of $215.43 per share.    Q3 Home Depot's third-quarter revenues are projected to jump by 4.8% to reach $26.23 billion, based our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. Meanwhile, the retail giant's comparable store sales are expected to climb 4.7%, based on our current NFM estimates. Investors should note that comps jumped 5.3% last quarter.At the other end of the income statement, Home Depot's adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to pop 23.4% to land at $2.27 per share. This would be solid growth for a company of Home Depot's size and age, but we still need to know how likely it is that the company tops our quarterly earnings estimate.  Luckily, we can turn to our exclusive Earnings ESP figure to do so. The Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter. The Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Home Depot is currently as a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that sports an Earnings ESP of -1.94%. Unfortunately, this means that our model is inconclusive. But we should note that Home Depot has topped our quarterly earnings estimates for over five years in a row.Home Depot is scheduled to release its Q3 financial results before the opening bell on Tuesday, November 13.

Time to Buy Coca-Cola (KO) Stock Near New All-Time High?
 Coca-Cola KO  shares jumped to a new all-time high Monday as the larger market sunk on the back of declines from Apple AAPL  , Microsoft MSFT  , and other giants. Coca-Cola is coming off an encouraging third quarter that saw its traditional soda and Diet Coke businesses perform well. But the question is should investors consider buying Coca-Cola stock with its shares up 11% over the last month alone? Q3 Overview Coca-Cola's adjusted third-quarter earnings popped 14% to $0.58 per share, which beat our $0.55 per share estimate. Plus, the beverage giant's global soda volume grew by 2% from the same quarter a year ago, driven by demand for Diet Coke and Coke Zero Sugar. Investors should note that the firm revamped its Diet Coke packaging and launched new flavors in January 2018. Meanwhile, organic revenue, which excluded acquisitions, divestitures, and currency fluctuations, popped 6% from the year-ago period. Overall company revenues slipped 9% to $8.25 billion, which was driven by the refranchising of Coca-Cola-owned bottling operations.Looking ahead, the company reaffirmed its fiscal 2018 guidance of at least 4% organic revenue growth. Price Movement As we mentioned at the top, KO stock has surged recently, up roughly 11% in the last month. Shares of Coca-Cola have also climbed 19% over the last six months. With that said, KO stock is up roughly 7% in the last year, which crushed its industry's 6% decline. Rival PepsiCo PEP  stock popped nearly 3% during this same stretch.We can, however, see from the chart that Coca-Cola stock has lagged the S&P 500 over the five years. Still, shares of KO hit a 52-week and all-time high of $50.24 per share Monday. KO closed regular trading at $49.87 per share.    Valuation Moving on, KO is currently trading at 22.7X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a premium compared to the S&P's 16.6X and its industry's 21.3X average. KO stock has traded as high as 24.2X over the last year, with a one-year median of 21X.With that said, Coke stock is currently trading above its five-year low of 16.7X and its five-year median of 20.8X. Clearly, KO's valuation picture has been better recently, but it does not appear that stretched at the moment.      Outlook & Industry Overview Coca-Cola Zero Sugar saw double-digit volume growth in Q3. The Atlanta-based company also noted that some of its other non-soda brands like Fuze Tea and smartwater performed well. Going forward, the company could get a boost from its recent investment in sports drink upstart and potential Gatorade rival BodyArmor. Plus, Coca-Cola is set to purchase UK coffee giant Costa for $5.1 billion to further expand its portfolio beyond sugary drinks.The company's acquisition, which it expects to close in the first half of 2019, will give the company a solid retail presence outside of the U.S. Costa currently boasts roughly 4,000 cafes, with about 2,500 in the UK. The company also sells coffee in gas stations and grocery stores and is expanding in China.The purchase could help Coca-Cola take on Starbucks SBUX  , Dunkin' DNKN  , and others. "Hot beverages is one of the few segments of the total beverage landscape where Coca-Cola does not have a global brand," CEO James Quincey said in a statement. "Costa gives us access to this market with a strong coffee platform."The company's recent moves highlight the need to expand beyond soda and also follows PepsiCo's SodaStream SODA  purchase. This summer, Dr. Pepper Snapple and Keurig Green Mountain merged to form Keurig Dr. Pepper Inc. KDP  . Q4 Projections & Earnings Trends Looking ahead, Coke's Q4 revenues are projected to slip by 6.1% to hit $7.06 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company's full-year revenues are projected to fall by 10.04% to reach $31.86 billion. But we should remember that KO stock isn't likely to trade based on its overall GAAP top line growth.Luckily for investors, KO's adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to pop 7.7% to touch $0.42 per share. Meanwhile, its adjusted full-year earnings are expected jump by 8.9%. We should note that Coca-Cola has experienced mixed earnings estimate revision activity over the last 30 days, with its full-year earnings trending upward and Q4 headed down.      Bottom Line Coca-Cola is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) based on its earnings estimate revision activity. But KO rarely misses quarterly earnings estimates. And we can't forget, especially amid market uncertainty, that Coca-Cola is a dividend payer that has raised its dividend each of the last 55 years. The firm has paid a $0.39 per share dividend in 2018, up from $0.37 in 2017.Therefore, KO stock might be one to consider even near its new high as it continues to climb upward on the back of strong momentum.

 Semiconductor stocks have been battered by recent market-wide volatility and concerns that the industry's strong cycle is nearing its end. The business is historically cyclical, so these concerns make sense, but buying opportunities are still present as valuations become more attractive and secular growth trends remain.We certainly hear a lot about how consumer-facing companies like Tesla TSLA  , Apple AAPL  , and Microsoft MSFT  plan to revolutionize their industries by harnessing the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, but we should also remember that semiconductor manufacturers also have the opportunity to grow as they provide the chips which power these technologies.The aforementioned emerging tech trends have created new consumer demand, and the semiconductor makers are delivering.Luckily, the proven Zacks stock picking methods are effective across all industries. Check out these Zacks buy-ranked semiconductor stocks right now: 1. Mellanox Technologies   MLNX  Mellanox Technologies is a leading supplier of semiconductor-based computer networking products to world-class server, storage, and infrastructure OEMs. The company's VPI enables standard communication protocols to operate over any converged network with the same software solution. MLNX has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now.MLNX is a pick for exposure to new tech trends, especially in the server space, without buying just a chipmaker. This could shield from cyclical volatility. This could shield from cyclical volatility. The stock is also an explosive growth pick, with earnings and revenue growth expected to finish at 114% and 25%, respectively, this year. Plus, considering the company's P/E of 19 and PEG of 0.8, the valuation looks pretty decent here.  2. Cree, Inc. ( CREE ) Cree is a manufacturer of LEDs and semiconductors that enhance the value of solid-state lighting, power and communications products. The company's "SmartCast" platform enables Power over Ethernet technology and is geared toward IoT products and Smart Building platforms. CREE sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has booked gains of 9% in what has been a difficult year for specialty chipmakers.Cree is another pick that investors might like for its growth metrics. For its current fiscal year ending next June, analysts have the company booking earnings growth of 284%. That growth is expected to continue to the tune of another 74% in the next year. Early estimates have revenue growth in these years reaching 11% and 12%, respectively.This implies Cree might not see the pullback some expect other semiconductors to witness in the near future. One can assume this is because of Cree's exposure to LEDs, and the fact that smart home and building manufacturing has a lot of potential in the next several years.  3. Intel Corporation ( INTC ) As the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, Intel has its hands in nearly every corner of the modern tech world. And as cloud computing and the Internet of Things continue to grow, Intel should continue to benefit. Plus, its broad product portfolio and diverse operations might protect investors in comparison to niche chip makers during trade war uncertainty.Intel has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and "B" grades for Value and Growth in our Style Scores system. The chip behemoth has fared better than many of its peers this year, and part of that is because it has fought hard to win back market share from key competitors. Investors might also find refuge in its relatively stability and 2.5% dividend yield. Moreover, the stock looks attractively priced at just 10.6x earnings.

Led by losses in Apple ( AAPL  ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS  ), the Dow hemorrhaged more than 600 points on Monday as Wall Street continued to be unnerved by fears of slowing global growth amid escalating trade tensions between the US and China, the persistent sell-off in oil, and worrisome headlines from Europe.The October meltdown continued to reverberate through Wall Street on Monday with tech stocks again taking the full force of investors' aversion to risk. A profit warning from Apple supplier Lumentum ( LITE  ) raised fears of soft iPhone sales in Q4, sending shares of the tech giant to its lowest level since May and crushing the remaining FAANG stocks.

 Wall Street suffered a setback on Monday, and the   Dow Jones Industrial Average    lost more than 600 points as major benchmarks followed suit with   significant declines. A combination of concerns about global   trade, currency markets, and future political posturing in the   U.S. and Europe all weighed on stocks. Adding to the gloom was   bad news from a host of high-profile companies.   British American Tobacco    (NYSE: BTI) ,   Lumentum Holdings    (NASDAQ: LITE) , and   Edison International    (NYSE: EIX) were among the worst performers on the day. Here's   why they did so poorly.Shares of British American Tobacco fell 9% on concerns that   the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will finally move forward   with its long-threatened ban on menthol-flavored cigarettes. FDA   commissioner Scott Gottlieb made comments about an expected ban   on flavored e-cigarettes but also said that it would add   traditional cigarettes with menthol flavoring to its anticipated   measure later this week. The move would hit BAT especially hard,   because its Reynolds American unit in the U.S. owns the leading   menthol brand, Newport.   Investors have worried about new regulation    for a long time, but the idea that it could actually come soon   spells trouble for British American in particular.  Image source: British American Tobacco.Lumentum Holdings stock plunged 33% after the supplier of   3D-sensing diodes issued a sales warning that sent shivers across   the mobile device industry. CEO Alan Lowe said that a major   customer asked Lumentum to "materially reduce shipments to them   during our fiscal second quarter for previously placed orders   that were originally scheduled for delivery during the quarter."   Most analysts assume that customer was   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) , and the iPhone maker's stock also fell. The   downward revision to Lumentum's guidance included a nearly 20%   cut to revenue and a roughly 25% to 30% reduction for earnings   expectations, and that shows how much   it and other suppliers rely on Apple's continued   success    .Finally, shares of Edison International declined another 12%,   adding to their losses late last week. The utility company said   that it will cooperate with investigations into wildfires in its   California service area, with the possible outcome that Edison's   Southern California subsidiary could have to bear at least some   liability for the Woolsey fire that's currently burning northwest   of Los Angeles. After having never fully recovered from the hit   that shares took following   wildfires in late 2017    , investors are more nervous than ever that what most saw as a   conservative investment could turn out to have huge risks.

As such, black gold suffered a never-before-seen 11th straight decline. Against this backdrop, the VIX -- or Wall Street's "fear index" -- surged nearly 18%.

December-dated gold futures fell $5.10, or 0.4%, to settle at $1,203.50 an ounce.
  (RTTNews.com) - The Thai stock market has moved lower in back-to-back trading days, sliding more than 25 points or 1.6 percent along the way. The Stock Exchange of Thailand now rests just beneath the 1,655-point plateau and it's looking at another soft start again on Tuesday. The global forecast for the Asian markets is soft, with weakness expected among the technology stocks and oil companies. The European and U.S. markets were down and the Asian bourse are expected to follow suit. The SET finished modestly lower on Monday following losses from the financial shares and the energy producers. For the day, the index shed 13.67 points or 0.82 percent to finish at 1,654.85 after trading between 1,654.80 and 1,673.42. Volume was 10.121 billion shares worth 28.826 billion baht. There were 1,167 decliners and 286 gainers, with 328 stocks finishing unchanged. Among the actives, Advanced Info eased 0.27 percent, while Thailand Airport shed 0.38 percent, Banpu tumbled 2.23 percent, Bangkok Bank lost 0.93 percent, Bangkok Medical fell 0.81 percent, Beauty Community plunged 3.52 percent, Bangkok Expressway retreated 2.30 percent, Charoen Pokphand Foods climbed 1.00 percent, Kasikornbank contracted 2.90 percent, Krung Thai Bank dipped 0.49 percent, PTT Global Chemical was down 0.32 percent, Siam Commercial Bank skidded 1.08 percent, Siam Concrete gave away 1.39 percent and PTT and PTT Exploration and Production were unchanged. The lead from Wall Street is broadly negative as stocks moved sharply lower on Monday, extending losses from the previous session. The Dow plunged 602.12 points or 2.32 percent to 25,387.18, while the NASDAQ dropped 206.03 points or 2.78 percent to 7,200.87 and the S&P fell 54.79 points or 1.97 percent to 2,726.22. A sharp decline by shares of Apple ( AAPL ) and General Electric (GE) weighed on the markets, while concerns about the outlook for global economic growth and a continued increase in interest rates also contributed to the sell-off. Light trading activity may have exaggerated the downward move, however, as government offices, the bond markets, and most banks were closed in observance of Veterans Day. Crude oil shook off early gains on Monday to end lower for the 11th straight session on oversupply concerns. Crude oil futures for December, which rose to $61.28 earlier in the session, settled lower by $0.26 or 0.4 percent at $59.93 a barrel, the lowest settlement since February.

5 Top Stock Trades for Tuesday: Goldman, Apple, and AMD Fall Hard
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe stock market was angry on Monday, sending tech stocks spiraling lower and putting a significant dent in the S&P 500 and Dow Jones. It's leaving many investors wondering whether we're going to retest the October lows or whether buyers will step in to buoy the markets. Of note, we have five top stock trades to watch to start the week.At one point today, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) was down about 5%. We don't have enough room to get into an entire discussion on Apple, but it appears traders are reacting to supply headlines out of Asia, while investors are still troubled by Apple removing unit volumes from the quarterly reports.We outlined the  pre-earnings strategy earlier this month , saying that a move below prior channel resistance (blue line) could push Apple down to the 200-day. On a test of this $190 level, we would be buyers, although surely everyone is looking at the 200-day.It makes me wonder two things: Will Apple test it and if so, will it hold? I could see the test driving it below the 200-day, simply because so many investors are watching this mark. At the same time, I could see it not even getting there for the same reason. So that will be an interesting development this week.As it stands though, Apple is an excellent company and there are various support levels between $188 and $192. For that reason, I would nibble some stock for a long-term position in that range.Man, what happened to Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS )? Shares have tanked about 12% over the last few sessions, as the stock teeters on vital support.Below $210 and I don't really care for GS, as it's now poked below the 2017 lows. Maybe GS finds support nearby or down near $200, but I would wait for a rebound over $210 before going long. Otherwise, it could be like catching a falling knife.Speaking of falling knives, General Electric (NYSE: GE ) has been nothing short of a disaster. After JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa slapped a $6 price target on GE stock last week, the selling has been aggressive.Right now GE stock is no man's land. Just like we've said for almost a year now, we can't buy this name blindly. Investors arguing that there is only so much downside also said that in the $20s, the teens and at $10. Notably, just a few weeks ago, we said GE is in trouble if it loses $10 .I don't know where this name bottoms. In the short-term, the selling is likely overdone. But I don't know when the bounce will come, how strong it will be or how long it will last. For that reason, I'm still on the sidelines.At one point, shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) were down more than 10% Monday. Clearly the 21-day moving average is acting as resistance, as is the $22 level.So now what?Let's see if we get a retest of the 200-day moving average and/or the $17 level. Investors can go long at that level with a stop-loss just below the October lows.Earlier on Monday we sized upHome Depot (NYSE: HD ) ahead of earnings, although that was before the stock fell 3%. The company will report on Tuesday before the open.With earnings on tap, investors should play the reaction, rather than take a stab ahead of the results. Should HD stock decline post-earnings, look to see if support in the low-$170s holds up.If it rallies, look to see if Home Depot can close above $190 and the 200-day moving average. Further, also see how it handles the $197.50 level and the 50-day moving average. If HD stock can hurdle either of these levels and close above them, look for them to act as support going forward.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell .

The Hang Seng Index now rests just above the 25,630-point plateau although it's expected to see renewed selling pressure on Tuesday. The global forecast for the Asian markets is soft, with weakness expected among the technology stocks and oil companies.

A sharp decline by shares of Apple (AAPL) and General Electric (GE) weighed on the markets, while concerns about the outlook for global economic growth and a continued increase in interest rates also contributed to the sell-off.

 Shares of   Universal Display    (NASDAQ: OLED) are down 12.5% as of 12:30 p.m. EST Monday amid a   broader stock market plunge and growing concerns of tepid   smartphone-industry demand.On the former, note the S&P 500 is down more than 1.5%,   while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite Index has lost around 2.5%   as of this writing.  IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.More specifically on Universal Display's decline, one big   driver of the market's drop today is   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL)  -- down more than 4% after   facial-recognition component supplier   Lumentum    (NASDAQ: LITE) lowered its outlook, citing a reduced shipment   request from one of its largest customers. Considering Apple is   shipping two new iPhones featuring OLED displays this year,   Universal Display shares appear to be falling in sympathy.To be fair, however, this news shouldn't be entirely   surprising, as Universal Display only   reduced its own full-year outlook    just over a week ago. At the time, Universal Display management   stated that while they expect 2019 to be "a meaningful year of   growth," the "magnitude of the second-half [2018] pick-up" in   OLED material sales simply wasn't happening as quickly as they   originally anticipated.It likely doesn't help that Universal Display is still   susceptible to downward momentum on the heels of that quarterly   report. But in the end, with shares approaching their 52-week low   and the company's long-term story still firmly intact, I think   now is a great time for patient investors to open or add to their   positions.  10 stocks we like better than Universal     Display       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

 By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Asian shares stumbled on Tuesday after a rout in tech stocks inflicted a hefty sell-off on Wall Street, while the dollar hit a 16-month peak on safe haven bets amid political risks in Europe and acrimonious Sino-U.S. trade relations. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  fell 0.4 percent to a 1-1/2 week trough, with Australian and New Zealand shares opening sharply lower.,  Concerns about a slowdown in China and the Asian region more broadly due to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods had spooked investors, sparking the largest monthly foreign outflows from Asia last month since August 2011, said Khoon Goh, Singapore-based head of Asia research for ANZ Banking Group. Funds returned over the early part of November on hopes that U.S.-China tensions would ease, Goh added, with the focus squarely on a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping later this month. "The outcome of the meeting will have an important influence on portfolio flows in Asia into the end of the year," Goh added. Worryingly, the Trump administration is broadening its China trade battle beyond tariffs with a plan to use export controls, indictments and other tools to counter the theft of intellectual property, the Wall Street Journal reported citing sources. Asian markets have also been hammered as risk assets have been hurt by rising U.S. interest rates. Overnight in Wall Street, major U.S. stock indexes dropped more than 1 percent, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq slumping over 2 percent. Indexes were weighed down by a 4.3 percent slump in index heavyweight Apple, after three iPhone parts suppliers issued warning on results.  In Europe, fears about a no-deal Brexit and a growing rift over Italy's budget hit the euro and the pound, pushing the dollar's index  to 97.64 against a basket of currencies, a level not seen seen mid 2017.  The greenback also strengthened on bets the U.S. Federal Reserve will increase interest rates next month.  The Fed's San Francisco President Mary Daly said on Monday the U.S. central bank should continue to raise rates gradually with her "modal" forecast showing two to three rate hikes over the next period of time.  The euro  was last at $1.12 after breaking below important chart support of $1.13. Sterling  fell to $1.285 after three straight sessions of losses took it to the lowest since Nov.1 as there were still considerable unresolved issues with the European Union over Brexit, British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Monday.  Oil prices fell again after declining for a record 11th consecutive session amid softening demand and as Trump said he hoped there would be no oil output reductions.  U.S. crude  fell 82 cents to $59.11 a barrel. Brent crude futures  slipped $1.20 to $68.97. Spot gold was a tad firmer at $1,201.4.

 Alphabet GOOGL  has a ton of problems related to privacy, anticompetitive behavior and now, employee unrest. While the company gives the impression that employee-related concerns are under control, it remains a problem trend worth watching. Amidst these concerns is the good news that Waymo is closer to commercialization, mobile search is getting a new interface through "Discover" and pictures are getting easier to understand through "Lens." Here are a few details- Waymo Closer to Commercialization The company appears well ahead of other players in the space including General motors GM  and Apple AAPL  based on the 7 billion simulated test miles and 10 million miles its cars have actually ridden on public roads. The company is currently adding around a million miles every month.The large number of miles along with the relatively small number of mishaps its vehicles have been involved in are perhaps the reasons it has become the first of around 60 companies testing the technology in California to receive a permit from the state's Department of Motor Vehicles to test driverless vehicles without a backup driver in the front seat.Waymo is moving toward the commercialization of the ride hailing service built around its self-driving cars. The company has indicated in the past that its commercialization efforts would begin by the year's end and on the last earnings call it was confirmed that the process has kicked off. So some of the early riders that were testing the service for free within a limited area in Phoenix are now helping the company decide on a pricing model. Testing continues in other cities like Mountain View, California and Austin.Last month, Waymo CEO John Krafcik told Roadshow that the Waymo trips would eventually cost as much as an equivalent Uber or Lyft ride but that the company was looking at other ways to make the service more attractive. "Businesses are saying to some of the users 'Hey, we'll pay Waymo to bring you to the mall, or to this destination, or to the hotel.'" Krafcik told Roadshow. "I think this is a really interesting future business possibility for Waymo," he said. in a recent interview with Condé Nast Traveler he said, "It will enable more people to try the technology more quickly when you can buy just a little slice of transportation for $6." ARK has estimated that robo-taxis might cost 35 cents per mile, include 5 cents to cover the cost of remote operators who monitor the vehicles and intervene when something goes wrong, the Financial Times reports. Google Discover The Google Home page on mobile has just become a place that you can use to discover new stuff related to your interests without so much as typing a word. It's essentially a Google feed of the things you're accustomed to searching online and is proof of how well Google knows you and the level of your knowledge on any topic.Its blog post from September says for instance that "Discover can predict your level of expertise on a topic and help you further develop those interests. If you're learning to play guitar, for example, you might see beginner content about learning chords. If you're already a skilled musician, you may see a video on more advanced techniques."If you aren't freaked out already and want to give Google even more information about yourself, you can further customize the feed to show more or less of the things it surfaces.If you are freaked out, you can disable the service. But for the record, Google says there are already 800 million people using it every month. Google Lens Integrated with Google Photos, Google Assistant and the native Android camera app, Google Lens uses artificial intelligence to tell you more about the images in Google Photos. It can recognize items in a picture that you may want to buy, or tell you about a book or record that you have a picture of, or about monuments and other points of interest when you're on travel, or even translate text that you photograph into a language you understand. All you need to do is circle the item you want information about and/or touch the dots on it after tapping the lens icon.Needless to say, Lens will get better over time, as it gathers more information about people, places and things.The feature was first launched in the U.S. for Pixel phones in the English language, then expanded to all phones using Photos and Google says it will soon be rolled out to other languages and geographies. Ethos Investment In a funding round led by Accel Partners in Google Ventures-backed life insurance application processor Ethos, the startup raised $35 million. The company, which says it can process applications in about 10 minutes instead of the usual 10 weeks, while eliminating the need for a medical exam or blood test, has now raised $46 million, taking its total valuation to a $100 million.Following the investment, Accel Partner Nate Niparko will join the firm's board of directors, while Google Ventures General Partner Tyson Clark will act as an advisor to the board. Sequoia Capital and VC Arrive also participated.The company says it saw a 400% jump in revenue, customers and applications in the last four months. Employee Activism The #metoo movement that doesn't require anyone to prove anything legally but allows complete liberty to women to accuse men of sexual misconduct is catching on. Unfortunately, the first company in Silicon Valley to be hit was Google, despite the fact that it has always given its employees a lot of voice and liberties.What sparked the unrest involving around 20,000 employees across the world was a New York Times article that blamed the company for paying the father of Android Andy Rubin a $90 million exit package while knowing there were reasons to believe that he had engaged in sexual misconduct. Rubin denied the charge while also claiming that the NYT number that Google hasn't refuted was a gross exaggeration.CEO Pichai has since said that the company was taking an increasingly hard line on such accusations and had fired 48 people, including 13 senior managers, in the last two years while denying them their exit packages. He has also said that Google is considering constructive ideas from employees to improve its hiring and management processes.One of these is likely the mandatory arbitration clause that is included in company policies to reduce cost, force quick settlement and keep the whole thing quiet. Google and other tech companies are doing away with this clause, which will help employees go to court and also appeal verdicts.It's quite an alarming trend when a company can deny you promised pay based on accusations that haven't been proved in court and it's hard to say where this will lead. At any rate it's a new flavor of arm twisting in an industry that has seen only a limited amount of trade unionism for tamer things like better pay and benefits. India During the Money20/20 financial-technology conference in Las Vegas, payments general manager and head of its "next billion users" initiative Caesar Sengupta said that Google Pay has more than 30 million monthly active users in India, generating payment volume at a $40 billion annual run rate.The Indian version of Google Pay is built on the country's Unified Payments Interface, a government-approved payment technology that uses email addresses for identity verification rather than traditional bank-account information.Google Pay is a much better option than PayPal PYPL  in the country where most phones run on Android and use a plethora of payments services, many of which are local.

 Whether you're eyeing a retirement date 10 years away or 40   years in the future,    dividend   stocks    can play a crucial role helping you to build long-term wealth.   That's because they offer two opportunities to benefit from the   power of compound interest: share gains and dividend growth.For instance, tech giant   Apple    currently pays a dividend of $2.92 per share each year for a   yield of about 1.3%. But if you had purchased shares a decade   ago, then you'd be enjoying a 19% dividend yield -- on top of   some remarkable stock returns.Of course, there's more to it than simply owning dividend   stocks. You have to own great businesses that also happen to pay   a dividend that's sustainable and has room to grow. We recently   asked three contributors at The Motley Fool for stocks that fit   this mold, and they argued for   Enterprise Products Partners    (NYSE: EPD) ,   Microsoft    (NASDAQ: MSFT) , and   Verizon Communications    (NYSE: VZ) . Here's why.  Image source: Getty Images.  Maxx Chatsko    (Enterprise Products Partners):    The company isn't a household name, but the nearly $60 billion   business is an integral component of America's growing energy   dominance. It owns and operates marine fuel terminals, natural   gas pipelines, processing facilities, and an increasingly   vertical stack of natural gas liquids (NGLs) infrastructure from   dedicated pipelines, storage facilities, and even export   terminals.A solid infrastructure footprint positions the business to   exploit numerous opportunities created by cheap natural gas and   NGLs, such as the   under-discussed $200 billion in investments    being made to build new petrochemical manufacturing facilities in   the United States. Successfully doing so will generate billions   in cash flow every year (and soon, every quarter) that can be   reinvested into the business or returned to unitholders. If   third-quarter 2018 operating results are any indication,   successful execution isn't an obstacle. The problem may be that   there are   too many    projects available to invest in.Enterprise Products Partners delivered record results on 16   different operational and financial metrics during the third   quarter of 2018, including $1.6 billion in operating income.   Management   raised full-year 2018 guidance yet again    as a result of the surprisingly strong performance. In addition   to business growth, income investors will be pleased to know that   the company can cover its massive distribution -- $1.73 per share   per year, or a yield of 6.4% -- with ease. The business is   generating the equivalent of $2.85 per share in distributable   cash flow.Simply put, Enterprise Products Partners offers a   rare combination of above-average growth and   income    that could help to bolster any retirement fund.

Todd Campbell     (Microsoft):    One of my favorite core holdings for dividend portfolios,   Microsoft has proven it can pivot to take advantage of changing   technology trends, making it great to own in long-haul   portfolios.The company has successfully diversified its revenue away from   personal computer software. It still pockets plenty of money from   sales of its Windows operating system, but increasingly, its   sales are coming from subscriptions to cloud-based software   solutions and video gaming.In its most recently   reported quarter    , its productivity and business processes segment sales increased   19% year over year to $9.8 billion due to Office 365 commercial,   Dynamics 365, and LinkedIn revenue growing 36%, 51%, and 33%,   respectively. Its intelligent-cloud division did even   better, as increasing demand for its server and cloud computing   solutions increased revenue 24% to $5.9 billion in that segment.   And, not to be left out, Microsoft's gaming sales increased 44%   in the past year.Overall, Microsoft's quarterly revenue was $29.1 billion, up   19% from one year ago, and its earnings per share were $1.14, up   36% from last year. All that cash that's coming into Microsoft   allowed it to return $3.5 billion in dividends to investors last   quarter, and I think the odds are good that the dividend will   grow in the future. Its cash dividend payout ratio, which shows   how much of a company's cash flow is being paid to   common-stock holders after subtracting capital expenditures and   preferred dividends, is only about 40%. That suggests it has   plenty of dividend-friendly financial wiggle room.  Image source: Getty Images.  Travis Hoium    (Verizon Communications):    I think wireless giants like Verizon are some of the most   overlooked stocks on the market right now, not just because of   their dividends but because of their long-term growth potential.   Verizon currently boasts a 4.3% dividend yield, and the dividend   has been growing steadily for more than a decade.     VZ Dividends Paid (TTM)    data by   YCharts. It may not seem like a saturated wireless industry would be a   place to find much growth today, but 2018 will mark the initial   launch of 5G networks in the U.S., which will change the industry   forever. Not only will 5G take over cellphone connections,   bringing broadband speed to mobile devices, but it will also   allow Verizon to sell wireless services into the home. The first   5G products will be home routers that don't require a cable,   phone, or fiber line to be run to the house; they just require a   Verizon wireless router in range of a 5G network. That alone will   allow Verizon to expand its potential market and offer bundles to   existing wireless customers.5G will also enable new technologies like self-driving cars,   virtual- and augmented-reality networks, and connected cities. As   one of the few wireless companies with the scale needed to build   a 5G network, Verizon has an enviable position in the market and   a dividend that I think has a lot of growth ahead for both   revenue and your retirement nest egg.  10 stocks we like better than Enterprise Products     Partners       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

  (RTTNews.com) - Stocks moved sharply lower over the course of the trading day on Monday, adding to the notable losses posted in the previous session. With the sell-off on the day, the Dow continued to give back ground after reaching its best closing level in a month last Thursday. The major averaged ended the day just off their lows of the session. The Dow plunged 602.12 points or 2.3 percent to 25,387.18, the Nasdaq plummeted 206.03 points or 2.8 percent to 7,200.87 and the S&P 500 slumped 54.79 points or 2 percent to 2,726.22. A sharp decline by shares of Apple ( AAPL ) weighed on Wall Street, with the tech giant tumbling by 5 percent to its lowest closing level in over three months. The steep drop by Apple came after iPhone parts supplier Lumentum (LITE) cut its fiscal second quarter guidance, adding to recent concerns about iPhone demand. Industrial conglomerate General Electric (GE) also moved significantly lower after Chairman and CEO Larry Culp told CNBC he feels the "urgency" to reduce the company's leverage and will do so through asset sales. Concerns about the outlook for global economic growth and a continued increase in interest rates also contributed to the sell-off on Wall Street. Meanwhile, in a post on Twitter, President Donald Trump claimed, "The prospect of Presidential Harassment by the Dems is causing the Stock Market big headaches!" Light trading activity may have exaggerated the downward move, however, as government offices, the bond markets, and most banks were closed in observance of Veterans Day. A lack of major U.S. economic data also kept some traders on the sidelines ahead of the release of reports on consumer price inflation, retail sales, and industrial production in the coming days. A speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday is also likely to attract attention, as traders look for additional clues about the outlook for interest rates. Last week, the Fed left interest rates unchanged as widely expected but indicated it remains on track to gradually raise rates despite signs of a slowdown in the pace of growth in business investment. Sector News Semiconductor stocks showed a substantial move to the downside on the day, resulting in a 4.4 percent nosedive by the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. Within the semiconductor sector, Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) posted a steep loss after Citi downgraded its rating on the Apple chip supplier's stock to Neutral from Buy. Significant weakness was also visible among oil service stocks, as reflected by the 3.9 percent slump by the Philadelphia Oil Service Index. The index ended the session at a more than nine-year closing low. The sell-off by oil service stocks came as the price of crude oil turned lower after seeing initial strength. Crude for December delivery fell $0.26 to $59.93 a barrel, closing below $60 a barrel for the first time since February. Computer hardware, biotechnology, networking and software stocks also saw considerable weakness, contributing to the steep drop by the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Most of the other major sectors also moved to the downside on the day, with notable weakness visible among tobacco, retail, brokerage and gold stocks. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher during trading on Monday. Japan'sNikkei 225 Index and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index both inched up by 0.1 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index shot up by 1.2 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets showed notable moves to the downside on the day. While the German DAX Index plunged by 1.8 percent, the French CAC 40 Index and the U.K.'sFTSE 100 Index dropped by 0.9 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively. Treasuries moved notably higher during the trading session last Friday, but the bond markets remained closed on Monday in observance of Veterans Day. Looking Ahead Amid another quiet day on the U.S economic front, trading on Tuesday may be impacted by reaction to the latest earnings news. Home improvement retail giant Home Depot (HD) is among the companies due to report their quarterly results before the start of trading on Tuesday.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSimilar to many consumer-electronics companies, Sony (NYSE: SNE ) suffered a poor showing in October. Last month, Sony stock dropped 11% in the markets. Its rivals Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) also incurred volatility, albeit to a noticeably lower magnitude.What made the decline in SNE stock distinctively troubling, though, was that it snapped a much-needed recovery effort. After the 1990's, the once-unassailable Japanese giant began showing serious weaknesses. Apple quickly advantaged those vulnerabilities, producing the iPod and later, the iPhone.Of course, Sony stock faltered during Apple's rise to prominence, but it wasn't the only victim. For instance, Microsoft couldn't gain any traction under the Steve Ballmer era. But when current Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella took over, the company adopted an entirely new complexion.SNE has enjoyed its own resurgence. The difference, though, is that investors generally don't find SNE stock believable. Japan's economy has endured a decades-long recession , and while we're seeing improvements, the road is a long, arduous one. Since Sony symbolizes Japan in many ways, prospective buyers remain leery.Despite these long-seated concerns, Sony stock put up great numbers following the U.S. midterm elections. Shares gained 3.3% after several weeks of choppy trading. That said, the broader markets received a post-election boost. Should investors trust SNE, or is this merely a head-fake?Earlier, I mentioned that several publicly traded companies enjoyed a midweek lift. Therefore, on the surface, it may appear that jumping on SNE stock is premature. Detractors might warn against conflating SNE's on-the-spot bullishness with substantive fundamental tailwinds.It's a fair point. However, it overlooks the distinctive advantage that Sony stock now carries following the midterm elections. With Democrats controlling the House and Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the unemployment line, Trump must operate more carefully.Such political dynamics have incredibly positive implications for Japan, and by logical deduction, SNE stock. Among all the allied countries with which Trump has dealt, Japan has consistently drawn the short end of the stick.It began during the 2016 campaign trail. A real-estate mogul at the time, Trump accused that the Japanese would " sit home and watch Sony television" if the U.S. were attacked. He also criticized former President Barack Obama for not mentioning Pearl Harbor during his visit to Hiroshima.When Trump took office, his negative and aggressive stance continued, sending a ripple effect toward Japanese businesses. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's attempt to personally restore U.S.-Japan relations to normalcy became a hilarious meme .Just recently, the President had an awkward and embarrassing exchange with a Japanese reporter. Referring to Abe by his first name - a cultural faux pas - Trump mocked the Prime Minister regarding ongoing trade discussions. I felt bad for the reporter. Apparently, he mistook the White House for a professional and dignified institution.Make no mistake: Trump's anti-Japanese posture was specifically bad for Sony stock. One of the President's first actions was to remove the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership proposal. SNE executives actively pushed for the deal as it would facilitate reduced trade barriers.Abe practically begged for Trump's approval, but to no avail.During his first two years in office, President Trump had free reign to treat the Japanese as he wished. With full control of the government, it was his way or the highway. But under a split government, he'll need to wade carefully.It's not just that the Democrats have the House. Rather, Trump couldn't rely on his "silent majority" to give him complete reign. The consequence is that unless he moves more toward the center, he'll risk alienating voters for his own reelection efforts.In this new paradigm, the Democrats will insist that the President treat Japan more fairly in trade negotiations. China represents an ironic partner because continued U.S. pressure against the Japanese would draw them closer to their regional neighbor.More importantly, this dynamic allows investors to focus on the many positives for SNE stock. Chief among them is the Sony PlayStation. The company enjoyed a strong beat for its second-quarter earnings report, and its video-game platform contributed the most. Thanks to a 27% increase in gaming revenue, Sony booked a $2.1 billion profit .Growing popularity for esports and similar passions will more than likely lift Sony stock longer-term. Management feels so confident about this prospect that it raised guidance for operating profit for the full fiscal year.It remains to be seen whether SNE stock can return to its former glory. But with a major political distraction out of the way, management can at least get back to business.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto was long SNE.The post Sony Stock Receives a Midterm-Elections Boost appeared first on InvestorPlace .
  (RTTNews.com) - After falling sharply early in the session, shares of Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) continue to see significant weakness in late-day trading on Monday. Apple is currently down by 4.7 percent after hitting its lowest intraday level in over three months. The sell-off by Apple comes after iPhone parts supplier Lumentum Holdings Inc. (LITE) cut its fiscal second quarter guidance, adding to recent concerns about iPhone demand. Lumentum President and CEO Alan Lowe said the company recently received a request from one of its largest customers for laser diodes for 3D sensing to materially reduce shipments to them during the fiscal second quarter.

Despite the Ups and Downs, 2018’s Been Good for Apple Stock
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsA doom and gloom headline about Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Apple stock caught my attention last week.The headline was, "Apple Stock on Track for Worst Two-Day Stretch in Nearly Six Years Amid iPhone XR Concerns"Apple stock is up about 14% year to date through early morning trading today, almost three times the S&P 500's gain in 2018.In fact, Apple's 2018 performance was better (as of Nov. 8) than 421 of the S&P's 505 constituents. Moreover, AAPL is working on its third-best return over the past five years, a result I'm sure Warren Buffett is more than happy with.Furthermore, despite all the negative sentiment about Apple's newer, pricier iPhones, its business model is far from broken."The iPhone [XS] Max has been selling well and will most likely help increase [average selling price] and gross margin, but we believe it will be difficult for ASP to grow in the second half of C2019," Rosenblatt analyst Jun Zhang wrot e about the company in a Nov. 2 report in which he downgraded AAPL stock.  If you haven't been paying attention to where Apple's headed as a company, you might get worried about Apple stock after reading that statement. Add in the fact that AAPL recently announced that it will no longer divulge quarterly unit sales data, and it's understandable why some investors might have soured on Apple. Those who are dialed into Tim Cook's plans for the business understand that the iPhone is merely the conduit for generating recurring services revenues.AAPL is most concerned about keeping owners of iPhones happy, whether they have the latest and greatest phone or own five-year-old iPhone 5Ss. "Our installed base is growing at double digits. And that's probably a much more significant metric for us from an ecosystem point of view, and the customer loyalty, etc," Cook said  on Nov. 1."The second thing is this is a little bit like if you go to the market and you push your cart up to the cashier and she says or he says, 'How many units you have in there?' It doesn't matter a lot how many units there are in there but the overall value of what's in the cart," the CEO added.The reality is that any slowing of unit growth will be made up by higher prices for newer iPhones.So, as in the case of  Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), user engagement and overall happiness with the product across all iPhones will be far more critical than actual volume growth.Morgan Stanley  analyst Katy Huberty on Nov. 7 raised her price target on AAPL stock to $253 from $226, citing its future services revenues."We think the market underestimates both growth and value impact of Apple's Services business," she wrote . "With a maturing, more-engaged iOS user base and broadening portfolio of Services, we believe Services represents the key growth driver for Apple over the next 5 years," she added.I couldn't agree more.I said as much back in February 2017, long before AAPL launched the priciest iPhones in the company's history.As Apple continues to be transformed by Tim Cook into a service business that also happens to make phones, some investors are going to be disgruntled.However, for those who want to make money over the long haul, 2018, in my opinion, was a watershed year for AAPL stock.As of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post Despite the Ups and Downs, 2018's Been Good for Apple Stock appeared first on InvestorPlace .
Amazon and Apple Play Nice for the Holiday Shopping Season
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) are both coming into the holidays in need of a big quarter. Amazon stock and AAPL stock both took a beating after their latest earnings reports, and the companies would rather avoid a repeat. To get that big quarter, it appears that the two have decided to cooperate. Amazon will be expanding the number of AAPL products sold on its website, including the latest iPhones, Apple Watch models and the new iPad Pro.This new partnership between the tech giants looks to be a win-win for both AAPL stock and Amazon stock.Apple and Amazon have a complicated relationship. They are competing retailers (at least for consumer electronics) and they compete directly in many areas, including with tablets, video streamers, smart speakers and streaming music. They will soon be competing directly with streaming video services as well.Historically, this has resulted in some friction, with the two companies refusing to support each other's products and services. But there has been a de-thawing of the relationship over the past year. In a big step last December, Apple announced Amazon Prime on the Apple TV . Just a few weeks later, Amazon announced it would once again begin selling the Apple TV , after kicking the streamer off its website in 2015.The two companies can benefit from each other. Amazon is one of the world's largest retailers and Apple makes some of the most in-demand consumer electronics. After its last quarterly report, Amazon stock took a beating, in part because the company's forecast for holiday sales was lower than analysts had been expecting . AAPL stock also took a hit after Apple reported Q4 earnings and announced it would no longer disclose the number of iPhones, iPads and Macs it sells . This was interpreted by many to be a response to slowing sales across many of the company's core hardware product lines.There is one obvious move that would benefit both Amazon stock and Apple. And it just happened.Amazon will begin carrying a wide range of Apple products, just in time for the holiday shopping season. They'll be showcased on the official Apple page on Amazon. This includes devices like the latest iPhones, the new iPad Pro and the Apple Watch. They join Mac computers, Apple's popular Beats headphones and the Apple TV, which Amazon currently sells.AMZN told CNET :"Amazon is constantly working to enhance the customer experience, and one of the ways we do this is by increasing selection of the products we know customers want. We look forward to expanding our assortment of Apple and Beats products globally."In addition, AMZN is cleaning house with its third-party marketplace sellers. Starting in January, only Apple-authorized vendors will be allowed to sell Apple products. That will help to standardize pricing, which should help to encourage shoppers. At the moment this is a big problem. For example, AAPL's previous generation Apple Watch Series 3 got a price cut to $279 in September, but a quick check of Amazon shows marketplace vendors charging considerably more . One of the first entries is $319.99 for a refurbished 38mm Apple Watch Series 3, and it's not even refurbished by Apple.The one item that is being specifically excluded from this new arrangement is Apple's HomePod smart speaker. With smart speakers expected to be hot sellers as gifts, it looks as though AMZN has no interest in boosting the profile of Apple's competitor to the Echo.Burying the hatchet has the potential for considerable upside for both companies.As Reuters points out, 71% of AAPL's sales in 2018 came through indirect distribution channels . The new deal with online retail giant Amazon has the potential to boost sales of its key products, especially through the holiday shopping quarter. At the same time, AMZN weeding out third party marketplace sellers is likely to improve the shopping experience by standardizing prices, while ensuring buyers have a positive view of Apple products.For Amazon, having the most popular products from the world's biggest consumer electronics company available just in time for the holiday shopping season is a huge win. If it's going to beat that lowball holiday sales forecast - and goose Amazon stock - having iPhones, iPads and the Apple Watch available to sell is probably one of the best ways to do so.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s.The post Amazon and Apple Play Nice for the Holiday Shopping Season appeared first on InvestorPlace .

Finally, Apple (NASAQ: AAPL ) shares slid on continued concerns of weakening iPhone XR sales.Let's take a closer look:Last month's rousing rebound in GE following news of a CEO change is all but a distant memory.

 By Kate Duguid NEW YORK, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Andrew Left has covered his short position on Facebook Inc, due to its booming Instagram business, but is still betting on a decline in Netflix Inc  shares, the activist short-seller told Reuters on Monday. "Instagram has really become a powerhouse - you can no longer deny it," Left told the Reuters Global Investment 2019 Outlook Summit, citing the way it accurately predicts what people want to buy, making it more attractive for advertisers, the company's main source of revenue. He said the video-streaming company was "addicted to debt" and vulnerable to competition from other FAANG rivals that offer streaming services, as well as established media companies such as Walt Disney Co. "Facebook can do what Netflix does, but Netflix can't do what Facebook does," he said. "You can't think that the rest of Hollywood will throw its hands up and say, 'OK Netflix, you win.'" Netflix went public in 2002 and had a modest debt load in its early years, but has issued a net $9.5 billion of bonds - of $10.4 billion total - in fewer than three years to fund content acquisition and creation. Its long-term debt as a percentage of capital has roughly doubled to 65 percent since the end of 2014, . In contrast, Left said it would be difficult to make money shorting Alphabet and Amazon, as Google was "a cash cow" similar to Apple, and Amazon should benefit from online shopping, a trend not likely to fade in the next five years. He said he remains long on Apple, whose market value recently topped $1 trillion, calling it a leader in innovation and, eventually, medical technology. Apple in August filed for a patent for a diabetes management device which monitors glucose levels non-invasively. That would rival similar work being done by DexCom Inc, a medical device company whose stock has more than doubled this year. "I don't know how the Nasdaq moves without Apple," Left said.

 By Sruthi Shankar Nov 12 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq Composite index fell about 2.5 percent on Monday, hit by a slump in Apple Inc shares after two suppliers cut their forecasts, sparking a selloff in other iPhone component makers and weighing on technology stocks. Apple shares  fell 4.4 percent to $195.40, their lowest since July 27, after Lumentum Holdings Inc, the main supplier for Face ID technology, and screen maker Japan Display Inc  cut their forecasts.

Stocks See Further Downside After Early Slump - U.S. Commentary
  (RTTNews.com) - After coming under pressure early in the session, stocks have seen further downside over the course of the trading day on Monday. The major averages have slid firmly into negative territory, with the Dow continuing to give back ground after reaching its best closing level in a month last Thursday. In recent trading, the major averages have climbed off their lows of the session, but they continue to post steep losses. The Dow is down 404.29 points or 1.6 percent at 25,585.01, the Nasdaq is down 169.23 points or 2.3 percent at 7,237.67 and the S&P 500 is down 38.45 points or 1.4 percent at 2,742.56. A sharp decline by shares of Apple ( AAPL ) is weighing on Wall Street, with the tech giant tumbling by 4.4 percent to its lowest intraday level in over three months. The steep drop by Apple comes after iPhone parts supplier Lumentum cut its fiscal second quarter guidance, adding to recent concerns about iPhone demand. Industrial conglomerate General Electric (GE) has also moved significantly lower after Chairman and CEO Larry Culp told CNBC he feels the "urgency" to reduce the company's leverage and will do so through asset sales. Concerns about the outlook for global economic growth and a continued increase in interest rates are also contributing to the sell-off on Wall Street. Light trading activity may be exaggerating the downward momentum, however, as government offices, the bond markets, and most banks are closed in observance of Veterans Day. A lack of major U.S. economic data is also keeping some traders on the sidelines ahead of the release of reports on consumer price inflation, retail sales, and industrial production in the coming days. A speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday is also likely to attract attention, as traders look for additional clues about the outlook for interest rates. Last week, the Fed left interest rates unchanged as widely expected but indicated it remains on track to gradually raise rates despite signs of a slowdown in the pace of growth in business investment. Sector News Semiconductor stocks continue to see substantial weakness in mid-day trading, resulting in a 4.1 percent nosedive by the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. Within the semiconductor sector, Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) is posting a steep loss after Citi downgraded its rating on the Apple chip supplier's stock to Neutral from Buy. Significant weakness has also emerged among oil service stocks, as reflected by the 2.7 percent slump by the Philadelphia Oil Service Index. The index is on pace to end the session at a more than nine-year closing low. The sell-off by oil service stocks comes despite a rebound by the price of crude oil, as crude for December delivery is climbing $0.71 to $60.90 a barrel after ending last Friday's trading at its lowest closing level since March. Computer hardware, biotechnology, and software stocks are also seeing considerable weakness, contributing to the steep drop by the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Most of the other major sectors have also moved to the downside on the day, with notable weakness visible among retail, tobacco, and brokerage stocks. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher during trading on Monday. Japan'sNikkei 225 Index and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index both inched up by 0.1 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index shot up by 1.2 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets showed notable moves to the downside on the day. While the German DAX Index plunged by 1.8 percent, the French CAC 40 Index and the U.K.'sFTSE 100 Index dropped by 0.9 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively. Treasuries moved notably higher during the trading session last Friday, but the bond markets are closed on the day in observance of Veterans Day.

 By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar surged on Monday to its highest point in 16 months against a basket of currencies and world stocks fell broadly amid concern about political risks in Europe, while a drop in Apple shares added pressure to U.S. equities and tech shares. Major U.S. stock indexes dropped more than 1 percent in initial trading, weighed down by a 4.6 percent slump for index heavyweight Apple, after an iPhone part supplier cut its outlook.  "Rising global uncertainty and a widening U.S. yield differential with other economies provide support, but an elevated valuation may constrain further gains," Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist with BlackRock, wrote in a research note. The dollar index  rose 0.57 percent, with the euro  down 0.74 percent to $1.125.  In stocks, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 333.07 points, or 1.28 percent, to 25,656.23, the S&P 500  lost 34.97 points, or 1.26 percent, to 2,746.04 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 172.45 points, or 2.33 percent, to 7,234.45. Apple shares fell as the main supplier for its Face ID technology, Lumentum Holdings Inc, slashed revenue and profit forecasts, citing reduced orders from a major customer. Lumentum shares tumbled 31.3 percent and shares of other Apple suppliers also dropped.  The S&P 500 technology sector, a main driver of the long U.S. bull run in stocks, tumbled 3.0 percent. Tech stocks  were also weak in Europe as the pan-European STOXX 600 index  lost 0.84 percent. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe  shed 1.19 percent, on pace for its third straight session of declines. Oil prices rose after Saudi Arabia said OPEC and its partners believed demand was softening enough to warrant an output cut of 1 million barrels per day next year.  U.S. crude  rose 1.08 percent to $60.84 per barrel and Brent  was last at $70.95, up 1.1 percent on the day. "Oil seems to be causing some jitters right now because they have been volatile," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin. "It should help energy stocks, yes, but whether or not it helps the overall market, that correlation is not clear a whole lot of times."

 By Sruthi Shankar Nov 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell for a third day on Monday, as a slump in Apple Inc  shares following weak forecasts from two of its suppliers hit the technology sector. The iPhone maker fell 3.8 percent after laser sensor maker Lumentum Holdings Inc  slashed its forecast, saying a large unnamed customer had materially cut orders, while screen maker Japan Display Inc  lowered its full-year outlook on weaker demand from smartphone makers.  The S&P 500 Information Technology index  fell 2.0 percent, while the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index  dropped 3.3 percent. U.S. stock futures earlier held steady as Brent crude  prices rose 0.9 percent after Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, said it would cut its shipments in December.  The S&P 500 Energy index  rose as much as 0.3 percent before turning lower. "Oil seems to be causing some jitters right now because they have been volatile," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. "It should help energy stocks yes, but whether or not it helps the overall market, that correlation is not clear a whole lot of times." Investors are also headed into a week that is heavy on retail earnings from companies including Walmart Inc Reports from a host of major U.S. companies have shown the impact of tariffs and a slowdown in China on corporate profits. Earnings from major retailers are expected to show how rising wages are eating into margins.  Wage pressures could increasingly be an issue as earnings-per-share growth for S&P 500 companies is expected to slow to about 9 percent next year following 2018's tax cut-fueled earnings gains of about 24 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. At 10:00 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was down 204.55 points, or 0.79 percent, at 25,784.75, the S&P 500  was down 24.47 points, or 0.88 percent, at 2,756.54 and the Nasdaq Composite  was down 115.71 points, or 1.56 percent, at 7,291.19. Nine of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with slight gains seen in the defensive real estate  and utilities  sectors. Tobacco companies Altria Group Inc  fell 3.2 percent and Philip Morris International Inc  dropped about 1.9 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. health regulator is planning to pursue a ban on menthol cigarettes.  Athenahealth Inc  rose 9.5 percent after private equity firm Veritas Capital and hedge fund Elliott Management agreed to acquire the healthcare software maker for $5.5 billion in cash.  Apptio Inc  soared 51.6 percent after the software company agreed to be bought by private equity firm Vista Equity Partners for $1.94 billion.

 By Sruthi Shankar Nov 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were headed for a lower opening on Monday, as a slide in Apple Inc  after weak forecasts from two of its suppliers and losses in tobacco companies offset early gains from a rebound in oil prices. The iPhone maker's shares fell 2.3 percent in premarket trading after laser sensor maker Lumentum Holdings Inc  slashed its second-quarter forecast, saying a large unnamed customer had materially cut orders, while screen maker Japan Display Inc  lowered its full-year outlook on weaker demand from smartphone makers.  Futures earlier held steady as Brent crude  prices rose 1.51 percent after Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, said it would cut its shipments in December.  That lifted energy stocks, with shares of companies such as ConocoPhillips, Schlumberger NV  and heavyweights Exxon Mobil Corp  and Chevron Corp  among the top gainers on the S&P 500 in premarket trading. "Oil seems to be causing some jitters right now because they have been volatile," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. "It should help energy stocks yes, but whether or not it helps the overall market, that correlation is not clear a whole lot of times." Investors are also headed into a week that is heavy on retail earnings. Reports from a host of major U.S. companies have shown the impact of tariffs and a slowdown in China on corporate profits. Reports from major retailers are expected to show how rising wages are eating into margins.  Wage pressures could increasingly be an issue as earnings-per-share growth for S&P 500 companies is expected to slow to about 9 percent next year following 2018's tax cut-fueled earnings gains of about 24 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. At 8:52 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis  were down 59 points, or 0.23 percent. S&P 500 e-minis  were down 6 points, or 0.22 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis  were down 37 points, or 0.53 percent. Tobacco companies Altria Group Inc  fell 4.4 percent and Philip Morris International Inc  dropped about 1 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. health regulator is planning to pursue a ban on menthol cigarettes.  Athenahealth Inc  rose 7.2 percent after private equity firm Veritas Capital and hedge fund Elliott Management agreed to acquire the healthcare software maker for $5.5 billion in cash.  Apptio Inc  soared 52.2 percent after the software company agreed to be bought by private equity firm Vista Equity Partners for $1.94 billion.  
 
 By Nivedita Balu and Jaslein Mahil Nov 12 (Reuters) - Coty Inc  replaced its chief executive officer and chairman on Monday, days after the cosmetics giant rattled investors by warning that fiscal-year performance could be hurt by supply chain issues. The company said retail industry veteran Pierre Laubies would replace Camillo Pane as its chief executive officer, its fourth CEO in as many years. The new executives are associated with JAB Holding Co, a consumer goods to coffee conglomerate that is the private investment vehicle of Germany's billionaire Reimann family. Both Harf and Becht run JAB, which has a 39 percent stake in Coty and is also a majority shareholder of Dutch beverage company Jacobs Douwe Egberts, where Laubies was the CEO until December 2017. The management shakeup comes as Coty struggles to integrate the 41 beauty brands it acquired from Procter & Gamble  in 2016. Last week, the company said supply chain problems from a trucker strike in Brazil, hurricanes in the United States and a warehousing issue in Germany were making it difficult to integrate the brands quickly. It also issued a profit warning that wiped out more than a fifth of its market value. "(The changes are) not that surprising given the poor performance of the company and the additional supply chain issues that have come about," said D.A. Davidson analyst Linda Bolton Weiser. Becht had handpicked Pane as Coty's CEO in 2016, but shares have fallen 64 percent since his appointment. Both executives previously worked at Reckitt Benckiser, where Becht once served as CEO. Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink said the degree of senior level leadership changes at Coty over the last two years has been overwhelming. Coty's new CEO Laubies is likely to face challenges that were similar to those at JDE, which he led for more than four years and was responsible for overhauling a mass coffee brand in a highly competitive market, said Jonathan Feeney, managing partner at research firm Consumer Edge. "Certainly some of the challenges of the COTY Consumer Beauty business rhyme with those of JDE," Feeney said. Laubies has also worked at confectionary company Mars Inc and soup maker Campbell Soup. Coty shares were up nearly 4 percent on Monday afternoon. 
 
 By Vibhuti Sharma Nov 12 (Reuters) - Apple Inc  shares fell to their lowest in more than three months on Monday as three suppliers issued warnings on results that pointed to weakness in iPhone sales. The Cupertino, California company's signature product has become pricier with every new launch and analysts say that consumers, especially in emerging markets such as India, are ditching them for cheaper alternatives like those offered by China's OnePlus.  Lumentum Holdings Inc, the main supplier of the Face ID technology in the latest generation of iPhones, cut $70 million off its forecasts for revenue on Monday, knocking another 5 percent, or around $50 billion, off Apple's value in morning trade on Wall Street. "Many suppliers have lowered numbers because of their unnamed 'largest customer,' which is Apple. Apple got cautious in their guidance and it's hitting their suppliers," Elazar Capital analyst Chaim Siegel said. Lumentum blamed the cut in numbers it gave originally just 12 days ago on a client that was "one of our largest... for laser diodes for 3D sensing", which analysts said could only be Apple. Screen maker Japan Display Inc  cited lower smartphone demand in cutting its own outlook, while British chipmaker IQE Plc  also said it expects a material reduction in its financial performance in the current year.  Shares in Lumentum fell nearly 31 percent, dragging down shares of other suppliers and chipmakers.  JP Morgan analysts weighed in by cutting their price target for Apple by $4 to $270 pointing to poor orders for the new iPhone XR. Three analysts said that Lumentum's forecast pointed to a reduction of 18 million to 20 million iPhones on earlier estimates, based on average selling prices for 3D sensing parts. "Apple could have accumulated too much Lumentum inventory, and needs to work it off, in which case the unit shortfall is less, although it is still indicative of weak iPhone sales." D.A. Davidson analyst Mark Kelleher said. In the fourth quarter, Apple sold 46.9 million iPhones, missing analyst expectations of 47.5 million iPhones, according to FactSet. Japan's Nikkei reported earlier this month that Apple had told its smartphone assemblers Foxconn and Pegatron  to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to the iPhone XR, the cheapest of this year's new launches. Longbow Research analysts said spot checks with Apple's Taiwanese suppliers late last week highlighted 20 percent to 30 percent iPhone order cuts related mainly to iPhone XR and XS Max, and 20 percent to 25 percent order increases for older iPhone models. Apple started selling iPhone XS and XS Max in September and XR model last month. Lumentum's chips are not used in phones older than last year's iPhone X.

Lumentum slashes outlook after top customer requests shipment cut
 Nov 12 (Reuters) - Laser sensor maker Lumentum Holdings Inc, which supplies parts for Apple Inc's  latest iPhones, slashed its second-quarter forecast on Monday, saying one of its biggest customers had requested to materially cut shipments. Lumentum did not name the customer. The company now expects net revenue of $335 million to $355 million, compared with its prior range of $405 million to $430 million, and earnings per share of $1.15 to $1.34, down from $1.60 to $1.75.

 By Taiga Uranaka TOKYO, Nov 12 (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp  has won approval to conduct a 2.4 trillion yen ($21.04 billion) initial public offering (IPO) of its domestic telecoms business, in a deal that will seal the group's transformation into a top global technology investor. The IPO will be one of the biggest ever worldwide, and will provide the group with funds to pay down debt and continue placing big bets on innovations that Chief Executive Masayoshi Son predicts will drive future tech trends. SoftBank Group aims to raise 2.4 trillion yen through the sale of 1.6 billion SoftBank Corp shares at an tentative price of 1,500 yen each, showed a filing with the Ministry of Finance on Monday. The amount could rise by 240.6 billion yen if demand triggers an overallotment, taking the total closer to the $25 billion that Alibaba raised in 2014 in the biggest-ever IPO. The final IPO price will be determined on Dec. 10, and SoftBank Corp will list on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Dec. 19 with an initial market value of 7.18 trillion yen - about 1 trillion yen above that of rival KDDI Corp, which has about 10 million more subscribers. The parent will retain a stake of around two-thirds, depending on the overallotment. 
 GROWTH IN QUESTION The mammoth offering comes at a time when investors have begun questioning the outlook for Japan's telecoms companies. The IPO was initially expected to appeal to investors seeking stability, but the government has recently called on carriers to lower fees while backing more wireless competition, sending shockwaves through the industry.  Yet SoftBank's brand name is still likely to draw retail investors long accustomed to using SoftBank's phone and internet services. Many still see CEO Son as a tech visionary who challenged entrenched rivals NTT DoCoMo Inc  and KDDI, and brought Apple Inc's  iPhone to Japan. Japanese households are commonly seen as an attractive target in IPOs with their 1,829 trillion yen in financial assets, even if they are traditionally risk-averse with over 50 percent of assets in cash and deposits. More than 80 percent of the shares will be offered to domestic retail investors, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. "I think a reasonable amount of money will be attracted to this one," said Tetsutaro Abe, an equity research analyst at Aizawa Securities. "It's a mobile company so the cash flow is steady. If you think about future yield and shareholder returns, it's a far more attractive investment than government bonds." SoftBank Group hopes that putting a value on the telecoms business will help bolster its own share price, which it sees as undervalued. Son in June argued that even without the domestic telecoms business, SoftBank Group shares should be worth over 14,000 yen - almost 40 percent over their current price - considering the value of its investments in Alibaba, Arm Holdings, Sprint Corp  and Yahoo Japan Corp, as well as Vision Fund. Investors have grown nervous about the lack of clarity in some of the investments by the $90 billionVision Fund. They have also been worried about the fund's dependence on Saudi Arabia, its biggest backer, following the murder of a journalist by Saudi security officials.  Its shares closed mostly flat on Monday at 8,777 yen, down more than 20 percent since the killing in early October. U.S. credit-rating firm S&P Global Ratings said the IPO was credit positive for the parent, saying it expects a bulk of the proceeds to be used to repay debt. The group's interest-bearing debt was nearly 18 trillion yen at end-September. Nomura, Mizuho, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and SMBC Nikko are joint global coordinators for the IPO.

 TOKYO, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Screen maker Japan Display Inc  on Monday posted a sixth straight quarterly operating loss and lowered its outlook for the full year on weaker demand from smartphone makers. The company, a supplier to Apple Inc, posted a loss of 4.7 billion yen in the second quarter. While that was narrower than the 12.4 billion loss a year earlier, it was worse than an average estimate of a 2.3 billion yen loss from six analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. The company said it expects full-year sales to grow 5-15 percent, versus a previous forecast for a 10-20 percent growth, and for an annual operating margin of 1-2 percent rather than an earlier projection of 2-3 percent. Some of its Chinese smartphone maker clients have also started using OLED screens for their high-end models. 
 
Why Apple Stock Is Up 22% in 2018 So Far
 Despite the recent roller coaster ride on Wall Street,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been a fairly consistent performer this year.   Its stock price is up nearly 23% -- even after October's market   dip -- while the broader market, as represented by the   S&P 500    (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has gained less than 5% in 2018.It took a combination of factors to drive the Cupertino   company's stock to its recent all-time highs. Let's look at some   of the biggest factors that played into Apple's rise in 2018, and   see if those share price tailwinds provide any insight into what   investors can expect in the future.  Image source: Apple.The company made headlines this year when it become the first   public company in U.S. history to top a   $1 trillion market cap    . While the milestone was largely symbolic, it was Apple's   underlying performance that drive much of its gains.When that 13-digit level was reached, the company had just   reported its   fiscal 2018 third-quarter results    , which were unexpectedly strong. That outperformance continue in   its   fourth quarter    (that ended Sept. 30), which topped off an impressive fiscal   year. Revenue in Q4 grew 20% year over year, topping both   analysts' expectations and the high end of Apple's forecast.   These results were largely driven by near-record average selling   prices (ASP) for the iPhone, which climbed 28% year over year to   $793, just shy of the $796 that Apple reported in the first   quarter. That number will likely continue to grow, as more   consumers opt for Apple's top-of-the-line smartphones rather than   its older, less pricey models.Apple's ability to consistently produce cash flow caught the   attention of none other than Warren Buffet, legendary for his   skill and acumen at identifying undervalued companies. Since the   company first hit his radar, the Oracle of Omaha has purchased a   stunning 250 million shares of    Apple stock    , currently worth more than $52 billion dollars --   a full 5% of the company's outstanding shares    . Apple's share   price    recently took a hit due to the slowing growth of the iPhone's   unit sales, but that doesn't faze Buffett, who has chided   investors who focus on a single quarter's numbers:Nobody buys a farm based on whether they think it's going to     rain next year or not. They buy it because they think it's a     good investment over 10 or 20 years ... The idea of spending     loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone X[s] ... are     going to be sold in a given three month period, to me, it     totally misses the point.Buffet has also said that he'd own 100% of Apple's shares if   he could, as he "likes the economics of their activities."  Warren Buffett loves Apple stock. Image source: The Motley     Fool.Another reason investors keep bidding up Apple shares is the   company's shareholder-friendly capital allocation policy. Earlier   this year, Apple raised its quarterly dividend to $0.73 per   share. At current share prices, that yields about 1.4%, but with   a payout ratio of just 23% of its profits, the company has plenty   of room to increase its dividend.The company has also been buying back its shares by the   boatload. In the past four quarters alone, Apple has repurchased   $73 billion in shares, bringing its total capital returned   to shareholders to almost $90 billion in fiscal 2018.Some investors say they're concerned that Apple's best days   are behind it, but those fears belie its massive opportunities on   several fronts.Apple has been successfully growing its services business,   which reached an all-time high of $10 billion in revenue in   fiscal Q4    , up 27% year over year, and is currently on track to top   management's goal of $51 billion annually from services by 2020.   This doesn't include the potential contributions of Apple's   long-rumored (but as yet unseen) entry into the global   video-streaming business. The launch, according to recent   reports, could come   as early as next year    . One Morgan Stanley analyst calculates that an Apple streaming   service could generate   more than $37 billion    by 2025.Another area of significant growth is Apple's wearables, home,   and accessories segment (formerly called "other products") --   which includes the Apple Watch, AirPods, Apple TV, Beats   headphones, and HomePod speaker. In fact, it's the company's   fastest growing segment: revenues rose 31% year over year to $4.2   billion in Q4. These ancillary products are part of a growing   Apple ecosystem that its fans can't seem to get enough of.The common thread that weaves its way through each of these   points is that  Apple's growth story isn't over by a long   shot. With customers gravitating toward the higher-priced   iPhones, and with rapid growth continuing in the services and   wearables, home, and accessories segments, the company still has   plenty of runway ahead of it. And that's not even factoring in   less clear potential catalysts, like its entry into video   streaming, or other works in progress that the company may be   keeping under wraps.It has been a great year for Apple so far in 2018, but the   best may be yet to come.

  Berkshire Hathaway    (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) , the conglomerate led by legendary   investor Warren Buffett, has performed quite well for investors   in 2018. The stock is up nearly 12% so far this year, nearly   doubling the S&P 500's 6.5% total return.Not only have Berkshire's businesses performed strong this   year, but the company's closely watched stock portfolio has also   been doing quite well as a whole. Not only that, but Berkshire is   also finally managing to put some of its stockpile of cash to   work, and Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger have indicated   they think the stock is attractively priced.  Image source: The Motley Fool.Berkshire's core business is insurance, and this segment of   the company has performed quite well in 2018. In the   most recent quarter    , Berkshire's insurance businesses earned a $1.68 billion profit,   a sharp contrast to last year's disaster-fueled loss.Berkshire's other business segments are performing well also.   BNSF, the company's railroad business, increased pre-tax earnings   by about 10% year over year. Industrial products, which includes   Precision Castparts, Lubrizol, and more, saw pre-tax profits   increase, and Berkshire's service and retailing businesses   experienced an impressive 25% jump in pre-tax profits. When you   factor in the benefits of tax reform, Berkshire's operating   profit   doubled    on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter.Of course, no discussion of Berkshire Hathaway would be   complete without mentioning the company's roughly $200 billion   stock portfolio. While there are more than 40 stocks in the   portfolio, the majority of the value is concentrated in just five   names --   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) ,   American Express    (NYSE: AXP) ,   Bank of America    (NYSE: BAC) ,   Coca-Cola    (NYSE: KO) , and   Wells Fargo    (NYSE: BAC) . (Note: Berkshire owns a big stake in   Kraft Heinz    (NASDAQ: KHC) as well, but it is accounted for under a different   method.)While the two big banks have underperformed, the others have   delivered double-digit total returns for Berkshire. This is   especially true for Apple, which is Berkshire's largest stock   position by far. The tech giant has delivered a total return of   nearly 23% so far in 2018, which has undoubtedly helped to fuel   Berkshire's performance. Company  Market Value of Berkshire's Stake  YTD Total Return Apple$51.7 billion22.7%Coca-Cola$19.9 billion11.5%American Express$16.4 billion10.3%Bank of America$19.4 billion(1.8%)Wells Fargo$24.0 billion(9.7%)Data sources: Berkshire Hathaway SEC filings, CNBC.Another encouraging sign for investors is that Berkshire has   been successful in putting its cash to work in 2018. The   company's cash hoard had been swelling for quite some time,   peaking at   $116 billion    at the end of 2017. Buffett and Munger told investors that they   were having trouble finding attractive ways to put the cash to   work, and there was speculation that Berkshire could even start   paying a dividend.Fortunately, Buffett and his team have been able to put some   of that cash to work. As of the end of the third quarter,   Berkshire's cash stockpile has fallen to $103.6 billion. This is   thanks to a major addition to the Apple stake earlier in the   year, as well as several other key stock purchases over the past   few quarters.Finally, investors were thrilled when Berkshire modified its   share-buyback program. Previously, the company could only buy   back shares when they were trading for less than 120% of book   value -- a metric that hadn't been reached in some time.Now, Buffett can buy back shares at any time when he and   Munger agree that the stock is trading for a substantial discount   to its intrinsic value.   Berkshire repurchased    $928 million worth of stock during the third quarter, which not   only helps the company use its cash but also indicates to   investors that Buffett and Munger think the stock is   attractive.  10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway (A     shares)       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Top Tech Stocks to Buy in November
 The autumn leaves have fallen, and temperatures are dropping   fast. But don't think for a second that our zeal for finding   fantastic stocks has cooled.We asked three top Motley Fool contributors to each choose a   tech stock that they believe investors would do well to buy in   November. Read on to learn what they had to say about   Universal Display Corporation    (NASDAQ: OLED) ,   TTM Technologies    (NASDAQ: TTMI) , and   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) .  IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.  Steve Symington     (Universal Display):    As the industry leader in phosphorescent organic light emitting   diode (OLED) technology, Universal Display Corporation makes   money by licensing its IP and selling OLED materials for use in   cutting-edge OLED displays made by the world's leading original   equipment manufacturers. In fact, UDC's tech is already featured   in the displays of billions of smartphones and tablets from the   likes of   Samsung    ,   LG    , and   Apple    . LG Display, for its part, is in the early stages of ramping its   own large OLED display manufacturing capabilities, with the aim   of quadrupling sales of its high-end OLED TV units to 10 million   in the next three years.After all, thanks to the fact that pixels in OLED displays   emit their own light and so don't require a backlight, they not   only provide superior color and contrast to their LCD   counterparts, but they can also be made rollable, foldable, and   even semi-transparent. And that's not to mention the potential   for   OLED lighting products     to disrupt another multibillion-dollar industry down the   road.Collectively, these trends will pave the way for OLED to   become more pervasive than ever in the coming years -- an   encouraging long-term view that Universal Display management   highlighted in the most recent earnings call last week.However, Universal Display shares also   plunged more than 20%    on the heels of that earnings report -- albeit after   soaring almost 30%    in the few days leading up to it -- after the company revealed   that a ramp-up in OLED demand simply wasn't as fast as originally   anticipated to start the second half.But our market hates being told to hurry up and wait, even   though   nothing    has changed with regard to Universal Display's enviable long-term   runway for growth. So I think the pullback offers a perfect   opportunity for patient investors to open or add to their   positions.  Anders Bylund    (TTM Technologies):    One of the world's leading makers of printed circuit boards   (PCBs) is a tempting buy right now.Share prices have plunged 33% over the past three months,   centered around weak revenue guidance for the fourth quarter.   TTM's industrial, networking equipment, and automotive clients   are steaming ahead with rising PCB orders and solid guidance of   their own, but the smartphone sector is lagging behind its usual   pre-holiday surge.Investors ran for cover when that tidbit was announced,   dropping TTM's share prices as much as 17%   lower    the next day.However, TTM's management provided a fairly clear explanation   of what's going on behind that modest sales guidance, and I think   it all makes sense.First, this year's collection of flagship smartphones was   announced a bit earlier than usual. That's why TTM's third   quarter crushed Wall Street's sales targets, having received some   of the business usually reserved for the next period a few weeks   earlier.Second, smartphone demand is running low in China and South   Korea. The Chinese weakness is probably tied to worries about the   ongoing trade war with America, while many Koreans appear to be   holding off on smartphone upgrades until the latest and greatest   handsets start showing up with support for 5G wireless   standards.So let's say the trade war ends in a year or two, and Koreans   spin up plenty of 5G-ready smartphones once that technology   becomes widely available. I don't think it's unreasonable to   assume that both of these positive trigger events will happen in   2019, and at the very least no later than 2020. At that point, I   think you'll be more than happy to look back at the time you   bought TTM shares at the deepest discounts that stock had seen in   several years -- and that would be right here, right now:     TTMI Normalized PE Ratio (TTM)    data by   YCharts   Chris Neiger    (Apple):    Some investors weren't impressed with the fourth-quarter results   Apple released at the end of October, but I think they're missing   the bigger picture of Apple's phenomenal fiscal 2018 results.The iPhone maker brought in $266 billion in sales for the full   year, a 16% increase year over year. As impressive as that   revenue growth is for a   company of Apple's size    , the company's 29% year-over-year jump in earnings per share is   even better. That jump was fueled, in part, by $73 billion in   share repurchases through the year -- showing that Apple knows   not only how to sell devices but also to bring more shareholder   value.For the skeptics out there, who might point out that Apple's   iPhone sales were flat year over year in the fourth quarter, I'd   say to check the device's revenue numbers. iPhone brought in $167   billion in fiscal 2018, up 18% year over year, thanks to the   popularity --   and higher price tag    -- of the iPhone X. The device, followed by the new XR and XS,   has proved that Apple can command higher price tags for its   flagship device and reap the benefits.If that's enough to get investors excited about Apple again,   then consider that the company earned $37 billion from its   fast-growing   services segment    , up 24% from last year. Apple's only recently begun focusing   more of its attention on services, and it's likely that the   company is still just getting started in this space.For investors looking for a great tech stock that continues to   deliver huge gains for its shareholders -- Apple's stock is up   18% over the past 12 months -- this tech giant   is still a great bet    .We can't guarantee that these three tech stocks will go on to   deliver outsize returns. But for investors willing to bet that   the challenges for Universal Display and TTM Technology are both   near-term in nature, and for those who can recognize Apple's   immense earnings power, generous capital returns, and its ongoing   shift to higher-margin services, we think buying them now will   yield more than satisfactory results in the coming years.

Tread Lightly With Fitbit; Its Rebound Is Already Old News
  Fitbit    (NYSE: FIT) reported better-than-expected results for the   third quarter of 2018    , including a return to profitability on an adjusted basis.   Shares rallied on the news, helping the stock get back to   breakeven on the year.The wearables maker has been rebounding with sales of its new   smartwatches while simpler fitness trackers continue to decline   -- but smartwatches were   always expected to yield results    once Fitbit got around to making them. If Fitbit's stock is going   to sustain a rally to the upside, it needs something more than   just hardware sales.A couple of years ago, Fitbit lost its title as the leading   wearable health tracking company. Consumers moved on from basic   health wristbands to more feature-rich smartwatches, like the   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) Watch, which now claims the title of   best-seller.The release of the affordable Fitbit Versa in the spring of   2018 helped Fitbit grab the No. 2 spot in the smartwatch   category, but overall sales keep falling year over year. So far   in 2018, the company has sold 8.4 million devices versus 10   million a year ago. That slide is beginning to   moderate, however, as 3.5 million devices were sold during   the third quarter against 3.6 million in 2017.Fitbit has been able to offset lower volume with higher   pricing from the Versa (average selling prices were up 3% in the   third quarter), but the company's declines are disturbing.   Industry-wide, fitness tracker and smartwatch sales have kept   climbing this year. According to tech researcher IDC, Apple and   Chinese maker   Xiaomi    's wearable sales are both up double digits in 2018. Despite an   optimistic consumer base springing for tech-enabled watches   and devices, Fitbit has simply fallen behind in the competitive   wearables industry. That makes a new business segment all the   more important to the struggling company.  Image source: Getty Images.Despite stubbornly falling device sales, Fitbit's bludgeoned   stock rebounded on optimism that the worst is behind it. Sales   have been up quarter over quarter all year, and the company is   now starting to lap the truly ugly numbers it first started   posting 12 months ago. That bodes well for a rebound.However, history has shown that tech is driven by innovation,   and Fitbit may be falling behind again in a new key category.   Even Apple, which has made a success out of hardware sales unlike   any other company, has been migrating to a diversified portfolio   of recurring service revenues rather than relying solely on   event-driven new product releases. For example, the Health app --   supported by the iPhone and Watch -- is a very visible display of   the company's   aspirations in the healthcare industry    .It makes sense that software-based subscriptions and services   are the next step for technology companies. The revenues are more   stable and predictable, and healthcare services specifically are   more necessary than they are discretionary.   Fitbit has been making a little headway    in this regard as well but doesn't have the breadth of Apple and   other rivals, and is limited to playing in the healthcare   space.On that front, it's been slow going. Healthcare revenue   increased 26% in the third quarter. That's a respectable growth   rate, but management didn't release more specific   numbers because the segment is so small it's immaterial to   overall results. CEO James Park said that healthcare revenue was   less than 10% of overall revenue, and that investors should   expect "slow-and-steady" growth. Given the flat overall revenue   growth -- driven by a slight decline in devices offset by higher   selling prices -- I'd say that segment is actually a long way   from 10% of the total. That means healthcare services, despite   the double-digit increases, will likely remain immaterial for   some time.Park said to expect more transparency in 2019, but barring a   big breakthrough, there likely won't be much to write home about   on the services side of the business. With Fitbit still relying   almost solely on device sales, investors should tread cautiously   around this rebound.  10 stocks we like better than Fitbit       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The Incredible Amazon Go Number That Only Apple Can Beat
  Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) plans to   flood the country    with up to 3,000 Amazon Go cashierless convenience stores by   2021. If the performance of the first half-dozen are any   indication, they could radically alter the retail landscape.An analysis by the data analytics firm   Brick Meets Click    of the first Amazon Go store -- which opened in Seattle in   January -- reveals a productivity sensation on steroids. Based on   customer activity over several days, it estimated that this   Amazon Go store generates $2,700 in annual sales per square foot   of selling space: a figure surpassed only by   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) and a select handful of other specialty   retailers.What's even more remarkable is that it's early days for the   new concept store, so consumers may not be fully aware of its   existence or how it operates. Brick Meets Click believes that as   more customers become aware of Amazon Go's convenience -- and as   Amazon fine-tunes its operations -- the productivity of each   location should rise even higher.  The new format convenience store is highly efficient in ways     that Apple can appreciate. Image source: Amazon.com.Amazon Go is a unique store. After downloading the Amazon app   to your smartphone, the app is   activated upon entering the store    , which then becomes aware of your movements throughout the   space, knowing what you pick up and put down. There's no need to   interact with a human; you pocket whatever item you want, and   through a dizzying array of cameras, sensors, artificial   intelligence, and machine learning, the Amazon Go store knows   what you've selected and charges your Amazon account   accordingly.The store is more convenience store than supermarket, with   most of those currently operating doing so only on weekdays,   catering primarily to the grab-and-go lunchtime crowds. The   laser-like focus on this specific customer niche also makes   Amazon Go a highly efficient retail operation. Brick Meets Click   estimates that the Seattle store is generating about 50 inventory   turns per year, or some four to five times the number of turns a   typical retail operation can produce.Apple is one of the only companies that has been able to top   this level of retail store performance. According to eMarketer,   Apple stores average over $5,600 in annual sales per square foot,   about $1,000 per square foot more than what they achieved five   years ago, while Gartner says Apple achieved over 60 inventory   turns in 2017, giving it "one of the best managed supply chains   in the industry."These are amazing numbers to be sure, but when you consider   that Apple is selling $1,000 iPhones, and MacBooks and iMacs   ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 -- while Amazon is selling   perishable food items for a few dollars each -- the achievement   of the Amazon Go store is all the more remarkable.Even if the early success of the Seattle store is not fully   transferable to other locations, Amazon is still achieving levels   of productivity and efficiency far beyond any of the competition.   And though convenience stores likely have the most to fear from   this new store format, grocery stores also face a threat they   can't ignore.Amazon Go stores carry a wide selection of ready-to-eat and   ready-to-cook food options that, while catering to the lunchtime   needs of consumers, also could challenge grocery stores and even   restaurants for dinner meal preparation.Certainly, other retailers will begin exploring cashierless   store formats. For example,   Walmart    recently announced that it is experimenting with a similar   concept for a Sam's Club store using scan-and-go technology. This   could eventually diminish the returns Amazon.com is experiencing   in the early going, but for now there is no direct competition --   and the head start in learning that the e-commerce giant is   gaining means Amazon Go could be a significant profit contributor   in the future.  10 stocks we like better than Amazon       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Do We Really Need a New Streaming Device From Facebook?
  Facebook    (NASDAQ: FB) seems to be jumping into making hardware devices   because everyone is coming outwit cool, new gadgets, but another   streaming device is the last thing the market needs and could   divert resources from other projects that have a better chance of   succeeding.  Image source: Facebook.Having just announced Portal, smart speakers that incorporate   artificial intelligence-enhanced cameras to enable video chat,   it's rumored Facebook has another project in the works for next   year that would go a step further.Ripley was discovered in Portal's Facebook for Android code   and   seems to be an ambitious set-top device that   incorporates Portal's AI,  but also includes streaming   capabilities from both Facebook Watch and third-party   providers.First reported by   Cheddar    , the new device could be announced as early as next spring, and   because of its comprehensive capabilities, could seek to   challenge   Roku    (NASDAQ: ROKU) ,   Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) , and   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) for a piece of the consumer living room. Where the   boxes and dongles of those providers typically have a narrower   focus, Facebook seems to be trying to break into the market by   making Ripley a multifunctional prescription for   connectivity.However, Facebook will have to get over high hurdles just to   get the marketplace to accept Portal, let alone another device   that goes beyond those capabilities.Facebook has developed a reputation for playing fast and loose   with user privacy concerns. That has already affected the   company's hardware ambitions, with data breaches delaying the   social networking site's announcement of Portal to last month. To   make things worse, Facebook was immediately caught misstating   what it intended to do with the data gained the Portal   device.Where Facebook had promised it would not use any data   collected by Portal for advertising purposes,   Recode    discovered that Facebook would actually use some of the collected   data for targeted advertising. Facebook admits that while Portal   would collect the data, it doesn't actually plan on using it for   that purpose. Considering Facebook's poor record on privacy, it   might have a difficult time persuading people to believe it.A brand with a stronger reputation for privacy might have a   better chance of succeeding, because a device that could go   beyond simple streaming might find some traction, but breaking   through the hegemony of Roku and Amazon (and to a lesser extent   Apple or even Google) is going to be difficult nonetheless.Roku remains the biggest streaming-device manufacturer, with a   37% share of the market, followed by Amazon at 28%, though a new   Alexa-enabled Fire TV Stick 4K could   narrow the gap    considerably. Apple and Google distantly follow with just 15% and   14%, respectively. For Facebook to break into the ranks in any   meaningful way, it would have to put an end once and for all to   its inability to protect user data.The fact that it would have Facebook Watch videos built in is   hardly an incentive to get the device.In its third-quarter earnings report last month, Facebook   acknowledged it wasn't adding any new users in the U.S. (and was   losing them in Europe), and though Facebook Watch was still   growing, CEO Mark Zuckerberg had to admit it was trailing far   behind   Alphabet    's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) YouTube. More telling was his   comment that people don't look to Facebook for video, even if   they watch it passively as it scrolls through their newsfeed.   They come for social interactions.Besides, it's not much of a moneymaker either. "Video   monetizes significantly less well per minute than users   interacting in feeds," Zuckerberg told analysts.Still, video accessed through a device separate from the   Facebook platform might fare better, and Zuckerberg said video is   a critical part of Facebook's future, so long as Facebook can   make it social. But that doesn't seem to line up well with   Ripley's purpose, and would require a massive investment to take   on the streaming titans that exist.Because Facebook has yet to get ahead of the story on privacy   concerns -- even flubbing it as it announced Portal -- it seems a   streaming device that encompasses technology that could further   compromise user data is a sure-fire nonstarter for most.  10 stocks we like better than Facebook       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Two Important Apple Suppliers Are Consolidating
  Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) is still years ahead of the competition when it   comes to 3D facial recognition, which enables its headline Face   ID technology. That technology is made possible by   vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (   VCSELs    ) that project infrared (IR) dots onto the user's face, which are   then captured by an infrared camera that uses structured light   imaging to create a depth map. Apple first introduced Face ID   last year and has now brought it to the iPhone XR and iPad   Pro.One of the reasons why the iPhone X suffered from supply   constraints last year was that the VCSEL industry wasn't able to   produce the types of unit volumes that Apple needed, as suppliers   were suffering from   low yield rates    . That was why the Mac maker made a massive bet on 3D sensing,   awarding supplier   Finisar    (NASDAQ: FNSR) a   massive $390 million    that it could use to build out capacity (which was   really just a prepayment    for future orders of 3D sensing components). Fellow VCSEL   supplier   II-VI    (NASDAQ: IIVI) just announced that it is acquiring   Finisar.  The new iPad Pros feature Face ID. Image source: Apple.II-VI will acquire Finisar in a cash and stock transaction   that values Finisar's equity at $3.2 billion. Shareholders will   receive $15.60 per share in cash and 0.2218 shares of II-VI stock   for every Finisar share (valued at $10.40 per share based on   yesterday's closing price for II-VI), subject to proration. That   pegs Finisar's value at $26 per share, a 38% premium over   yesterday's close for Finisar. Finisar investors would own   roughly 31% of the combined company.The combined company will be better positioned to capitalize   on numerous growth markets. "Together, we believe that we will be   better strategically positioned to play a strong leadership role   in the emerging markets of 5G, 3D sensing, cloud computing,   electric and autonomous vehicles, and advanced microelectronics   manufacturing," II-VI CEO Dr. Vincent Mattera said in a   statement. Dr. Mattera will serve as CEO of the combined   company.II-VI and Finisar expect to realize $150 million in cost   synergies within 3 years of the deal closing. II-VI is funding   the transaction with cash on hand, issuing shares, and taking on   $2 billion in additional debt. The deal is expected to close in   mid-2019.It's never a great thing for a customer when two companies   supplying similar components consolidate, as that reduces   competition. While II-VI and Finisar combined will present a   greater threat to rival   Lumentum Holdings    (NASDAQ: LITE) , which is Apple's largest 3D sensor   supplier, the net result will likely be reduced price competition   in the broader market for 3D sensing components. In general,   pitting suppliers against each other is a key tool that companies   use to reduce component costs. Once the deal closes, Apple could   potentially face modestly higher costs for 3D sensing   components.The silver lining is that 3D sensing components make up a   negligible part of Apple's overall cost structure. Those   ingredients aren't nearly as significant as other components like   NAND memory, whose volatile pricing swings have a huge impact on   Apple's costs and gross margin profile.  10 stocks we like better than II-VI       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Beat the Market with Pure Style ETFs
    In this episode of ETF Spotlight, I talked with Nick Kalivas, Senior Equity Product Strategist at Invesco.Most investors are familiar with traditional growth and value investment styles. Pure styles offer focused approach to growth and value style investing by eliminating stocks with overlapping characteristics.These indexes define about one fourth of S&P 500 stocks with strongest growth characteristics as "pure growth" and one fourth with strong value characteristics as "pure value." These two buckets have no overlapping stocks. Index constituents are then weighted by their style scores.Nick explained how stocks are selected and weighted in these pure style indexes, which can be seen as second-generation style approaches.I looked at the performance of the Invesco S&P 500 Pure Growth ETF ( RPG  ) and  Invesco S&P 500 Pure Value ETF ( RPV  ) over the past ten years. Both RPV and RPG have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 index.  (Chart source: StockCharts.com)Superior performance of these approaches can primarily be attributed to a combination of sector allocation and stock selection process. Find out more on the podcast.RPG currently has highest exposure to Technology (37%) and Healthcare (23%) sectors. Its top holdings include Netflix ( NFLX  ), Adobe ( ADBE  ) and Red Hat ( RHT  ). Unlike market cap weighted S&P 500 growth ETFs, which are dominated by Apple ( AAPL  ), Microsoft ( MSFT  ) and Amazon ( AMZN  ), RPG provides more diversified exposure.RPV allocates about 26% to Financials and 19% to Consumer Discretionary sectors. Its top holdings include CenturyLink ( CTL  ), Kohl's ( KSS  ) and Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.B  ).Combining these two ETFs, with semiannual rebalancing, could result in outperformance over the S&P 500 index. The portfolio would likely have higher volatility but better risk-adjusted returns than SPY.

 Shares of Roku ROKU  continued to fall Friday despite the company's third quarter top and bottom-line beats Wednesday. It seems that investors were disappointed with the company's platform revenue growth, but the company and Roku stock appear strong in a streaming entertainment age that is only growing. Roku Overview Roku, which went public in the fall of 2017, sells devices that allow customers to watch streaming services such as Netflix NFLX  and Amazon AMZN  Prime all in one place, similar to Apple AAPL  TV or Google's GOOGL  Chromecast. Meanwhile, the Roku Channel lets users watch streaming movies and TV shows for free without a subscription. The company also has a newer, more advanced targeted advertising business. Price Movement Roku shares had surged since the firm went public at $14 per share in September 2017. Roku stock hit $77.57 in early October, but has plummet since then.Investors should note that Roku stock rested at $43.47 per share through late afternoon trading Friday after a significant post-Q3 selloff. Therefore, shares of Roku are down roughly 44% from their 52-week high, which sets up what could prove to be a great buying opportunity since the company itself looks strong.    Q3 Overview Roku on Wednesday reported total quarterly revenue of $173.4 million. This marked a 39% jump from the year-ago period and easily topped our $170.91 million Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company did post an adjusted quarterly loss of $0.09 per share, which came in significantly lower than our projected loss of $0.13.The streaming firm's platform revenues soared 74% from $57.5 million in the year-ago period to reach $100.1 million, this also marked an 11% jump from Q2. Despite the impressive growth, Roku's platform revenues came in below FactSet's $103.2 million  forecast. And if this is all that caused the massive drop off then Roku might be in good shape. The Good Roku's active accounts surged 43% to 23.8 million, while streaming hours soared 63% to 6.2 billion. Investors should also pay close attention to average revenue per user as they do for Facebook FB  and others. Roku saw its ARPU jump 37% to a record $17.34-over a trailing 12-month basis.Meanwhile, the company's vital and growing platform revenue accounted for 58% of total revenue, compared to 46% in the year-ago period. Roku noted that over two-thirds of this revenue came from advertising-based services. "As our scale has increased, Roku has become a more important platform for content providers and advertisers, driving both engagement and monetization," the company wrote in a letter to shareholders."TV advertising shifting to streaming represents our largest opportunity over the long-term as we capture an increasing share of advertising inventory and as content partners and brand sponsors engage directly with our users in the Roku user interface." Outlook It is worth noting that the company estimates that more than 25% of all smart TVs sold in the U.S. in 2018 have been Roku TVs. This marked a jump from approximately 20% in 2017 and 13% in 2016. TVs with Roku's services built-in have become extremely important. Roku noted that over half of its new accounts came from licensed sources, with a large chunk of that coming from Roku TVs.Roku now expects to post Q4 revenues in the range of $255 million to $265 million. Our current Zacks Consensus Estimate projects fourth quarter revenues will surge 38.5% to reach $260.65 million. Meanwhile, the company expects full-year revenue between $722 million and $732 million-our full-year revenue estimate currently calls for $723.14 million, which would mark a 41% surge.        At the other end of the income statement, Roku is expected to post an adjusted full-year loss of $0.08 per share. This would actually represent a nearly 94% surge from fiscal 2017.  It is worth noting that these estimates could change as analysts continue to reevaluate the firm following its Q3 earnings report. Still, Roku's position in the booming streaming TV industry, along with its growth prospects and its current discount compared to where it has traded could make Roku stock worth considering. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All  
 Nov 9 (Reuters) - Apple Inc  said on Friday it had found some issues affecting some of its iPhone X and 13-inch MacBook pro products and said the company would fix them free of charge. The repair offers are the latest in a string of product quality problems over the past year even as Apple has raised prices for most of its laptops, tablets and phones to new heights. Its top-end iPhones now sell for as much as $1,449 and its best iPad goes for as much as $1,899.  Apple said displays on iPhone X, which came out in 2017 with a starting price of $999, may experience touch issues due to a component failure, adding it would replace those parts for free. The company said it only affects the original iPhone X, which has been superseded by the iPhone XS and XR released this autumn. Only a limited number of 128GB and 256GB solid-state drives in 13-inch MacBook Pro units sold between June 2017 and June 2018 were affected, Apple on its website. In June, Apple said it would offer free replacements for the keyboards in some MacBook and MacBook Pro models. The keyboards, which Apple introduced in laptops starting in 2015, had generated complaints on social media for how much noise they made while typing and for malfunctioning unexpectedly. Apple changed the design of the keyboard this year, adding a layer of silicone underneath the keys. 
 
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn Wednesday, Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU ) reported earnings that beat estimates. Yet the stock price was heavily penalized the next day. Although I believe ROKU's management will successfully take the necessary steps to grow the company profitably in the long run, I do not think Roku stock will repeat its past exponential up move in the next few months. Thus, investors should not rush to hit the buy button in ROKU shares yet.The recent selloff - especially in the tech sector - may be an important signal that investors are no longer willing to be exuberant with technology stocks and their rich valuation numbers. And investors' harsh reaction to ROKU earnings call might be an example of their more cautious thinking in the near future. On Thursday, the day after it reported, ROKU stock closed down over 20%.The streaming device platform Roku, which also is the leading connected TV manufacturer in the U.S., has been a darling of Wall Street since its IPO in 2017. ROKU stock price has gone up from $17 to a high of $77 in just over a year, benefiting from the disruptive internet-entertainment revolution that has made viewing more personalized. Yet the current sentiment seems to have shifted on ROKU stock and investors are left wondering what is next for Roku share price.Before the earnings call, long-term ROKU bulls happily highlighted many of Roku's competitive advantages, starting with ROKU's share of smart TVs sold in the U.S. and a projected annual growth of over 30% in the rapidly-expanding over-the-top  streaming market.However, Roku bears are rightfully concerned that ROKU is still losing money - at 9 cents per share, and its guidance points to further losses in the next quarter, too. Unlike Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), Roku does not generate content. This is another reason why some investors worry that Roku's revenue growth through subscriptions may simply be not enough to justify the rich valuation of about 170 times earnings.Roku's earnings call showed that platform revenues came in less than $3 million in expectations - a big question mark regarding future revenues. ROKU is also facing increasing competition from tech rivals such as Alphabet 's (NASDAQ: GOOG , GOOGL ) Chromecast , Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Apple TV , and Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Fire TV .The answer depends on your evaluation of the fundamentals of the ROKU stock as well as the noise surrounding the company at this point.After the recent tech selloff, as well as the fall in its share price following its earnings calls, Roku stock has suffered from a damaging technical picture. Its technical chart looks rather weak, and it is pointing to more choppy action in the short-term, possibly between $40 and $50. Long-term technical chart looks even weaker, suggesting a potential fall to the low $30's level. A further pullback to below $40 would make ROKU shares quite attractive again. ROKU stock's 52-week price range has been $18.56 (Nov. 8, 2017)-$ 77.57 (Oct. 1, 2018).If you already own ROKU stock, you might want to hold your position. However, within the parameters of your portfolio allocation and risk/return profile, you may consider placing a stop loss at about 3-5% below the current point. If you are looking for an entry signal to buy ROKU shares, both from a technical chart perspective and based on fundamental metrics and valuation, I am not expecting the stock to make a significant leg up any time soon. You may want to wait for the release of the next quarterly statement in early 2019 to re-evaluate the balance sheet and the fundamentals.If you are willing to stay in the ROKU stock 4-5 years, I trust that the management will work through the main issues surrounding the health of the company and the stock will reward patient investors handsomely. Roku may also find itself in the middle of a bidding war from the competitors to be acquired.As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post After Its Earnings Call, Should You Buy ROKU Stock? appeared first on InvestorPlace .
Qualcomm Stock Looks Good Below $60
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsQualcomm  (NASDAQ: QCOM ) stock dropped yesterday after the company reported strong fourth -quarter numbers which were overshadowed by weak first-quarter revenue guidance. That weak guidance was largely the result of QCOM's ongoing litigation with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), a headwind which QCOM stock has been exceptionally sensitive to over the past few quarters. That sensitivity continued yesterday,  as QCOM stock dropped more than 7%.But this might be the time to get bullish on QCOM stock.Qualcomm's growth outlook isn't all that great, and QCOM stock is being weighed down tremendously by ongoing litigation. But it's a multi-faceted company, and its growth drivers are becoming diversified away from Apple. As a result, while QCOM's growth going forward won't be great, its growth outlook is still good and stable.Good and stable isn't priced in at current levels. QCOM stock is now trading below 13 times its forward earnings, and it has a 4%-plus dividend yield. Historically, whenever Qualcomm stock gets this cheap, it rebounds. The same dynamic should repeat this time around, given the stability of the company's fundamental outlook.As a result, QCOM stock looks attractive in the wake of its post-earnings dip. The long-term upside of QCOM is muted by the company's moderate growth prospects and the litigation it's facing. But Qualcomm stock is too cheap here, and a near-term recovery rally is likely in the cards.Qualcomm's fourth-quarter numbers were much better than expected across the board, as its revenues, margins, and profits all beat expectations. But all aspects of its first-quarter guidance were much weaker than expected.Thus, the present dynamic at Qualcomm is still one defined by an ongoing battle between Apple-related headwinds and Internet of Things and artificial intelligence tailwinds. The outcome of this battle remains uncertain, and it's worth noting that Apple accounts for a big chunk of Qualcomm's licensing revenues.But the transition away from AAPL is already happening, as Qualcomm's revenues are expected to fall between 13% and 26% in Q1, and it does appear that after Q1, the worst will be over. On its earnings call, QCOM sounded bullish about its back-half earnings and revenues, while the Street expects its revenue growth to resume after this year.In the big picture, then, Qualcomm will be just fine even without Apple. QCOM remains a big player in the smartphone world, and it has partnered in multiple 5G rollouts. The company is also getting a big boost from the auto industry, where it's crafting a leadership position for itself in infotainment and 5G- connected cars. Also, Qualcomm's Snapdragon product is starting to be used in big, continuous- growth markets, like augmented reality/virtual reality, AI and machine learning.As a result of all of these trends, Qualcomm is increasing its exposure to products that have nothing to do with AAPL, thus lessening its reliance on Apple. Over the long-term, this strategy will enable Qualcomm's top and bottom lines to increase by moderate amounts.Consequently, the fundamentals supporting QCOM stock aren't great, but they aren't awful either. Instead, they are simply good, and good growth should be enough to spark a recovery rally by QCOM .After its most recent selloff, QCOM is trading below 13 times its forward earnings, with a 4% dividend yield. Every time QCOM stock has gotten this cheap in the past, it has bounced.Over the past year, Qualcomm stock has tended to rebound after the shares fell to about 13 times the company's expected forward earnings. The company's forward multiple dipped below 13 about a year ago, right before QCOM surged on rumors that it would be acquired by  Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO ). Once that chatter died down, QCOM stock fell, and it bottomed when the forward multiple got close to 13 again.Meanwhile,  every time the dividend yield of QCOM has risen above 4% since 2016, the stock was in the process of bottoming and proceeded to reverse course shortly thereafter.Thus, history indicates that with Qualcomm stock trading below 13 times its forward earnings and featuring a 4%-plus yield, the stock is due for a recovery rally. Since the fundamentals underlying the stock are largely the same as they have been for the past few quarters, history should repeat itself soon.The long-term upside of QCOM is limited by the company's mild growth prospects and litigation headwinds. But the stock has become too cheap to ignore, and history says the shares should rally soon.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long QCOM and AAPL. The post Qualcomm Stock Looks Good Below $60 appeared first on InvestorPlace .
 Shares of Disney DIS  popped Friday morning after the company reported record-setting full-year revenue and earnings Thursday, along with solid top and bottom line Q4 beats. Yet, most of the buzz seems to surround Disney's streaming push to take on Netflix NFLX  and Amazon AMZN  . So, let's look at everything we know about Disney's streaming service so far. Quick Q4 Overview Disney's Q4 revenue climbed 12% to reach $14.307 billion, which topped our $13.81 billion Zacks Consensus estimate. At the other end of the income statement, the media giant's adjusted quarterly earnings soared 38%.More specifically, Disney's Media Networks unit revenues, which features its cable and broadcast division, jumped 9% to reach $5.963 billion. Meanwhile, Parks and Resorts revenues climbed 9% to $5.070 billion. Lastly, Disney's Studio Entertainment division revenue skyrocketed 50% to touch $2.151 billion (also read: Here's How Disney Stacked Up Against Q4 Estimates  ).Plus, the EU, the U.S. Justice Department, and both companies' shareholders have now approved Disney's planned $71.3 billion purchase of key 21st Century Fox FOXA  entertainment assets. Disney noted that it still needs a few more approvals, but is more optimistic that the deal will get done even earlier than it originally anticipated.     Streaming Basics Now that we have quickly reviewed the company's fourth quarter, it's time to dive into everything we learned about Disney's new streaming services from the company's conference call.First, the media conglomerate announced that it settled on a name: Disney Plus or Disney+  . The company also maintained its late 2019 launch timeline. CEO Bob Iger said that Disney would show off some parts of the app, along with its pricing strategy at an investor meeting tentatively scheduled for April.The app is set to "feature elegant navigation, personalization and content, segmented primarily by our core brands namely Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and the soon to be added National Geographic. It will blend library product with original content under these five brand banners and we are confident it will be a compelling consumer proposition," Iger said on the conference call.Disney executives didn't give any updated pricing estimates. But Iger said last quarter that the company's stand-alone streaming platform's price would reflect its lower volume compared to soon-to-be-rivals such as Netflix-Netflix premium plans cost $13.99 per month, while standard plans go for $10.99. Content The media giant said that it will roll out Disney+ with a "rich array" of original Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and National Geographic content. Iger also said on the conference call that the platform will feature "unprecedented access" to Disney's library of film and television content.In terms of specific titles, the company has officially announced a decent chunk of names. Disney+ will feature the first live-action Star Wars series called The Mandalorian.  The company is also currently making a second live-action Star Wars series that is said to be a prequel to Rogue One  .On the Marvel front, Disney noted that it is developing a live-action series about Loki, which will star Tom Hiddleston. On top of that, Disney has a High School Musical  series in the works, as well as a Monsters, Inc.  series from Pixar.Disney also announced some of its original movie plans for Disney+. The company is set to make a Christmas movie starring Anna Kendrick, a live-action Lady and the Tramp  film, and an adventure movie starring Willem Dafoe, titled Togo.The firm is expected to roll out documentaries as well, including plans for a behind-the-scenes look at Walt Disney Imagineering. Outlook It is worth remembering that Disney has slowly tried to end some of its current licensing deals that it made before it decided to make its own streaming TV push. This means that not every Disney-owned property will be available on Disney+.However, Disney did stress that all of its movies from 2019 onward will be available on the streaming service. The 2019 slate of movies includes Captain Marvel  , Aladdin  , Toy Story 4  , The Lion King  , Star Wars: Episode IX  , Frozen 2  , and more.Looking ahead, it seems that Disney's streaming service could easily compete against or alongside Netflix and Amazon, and soon enough Apple AAPL  and A&T T  in a ever-growing streaming entertainment world.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLeading the Apple  (NASDAQ: AAPL ) rumor mill today is news of a faster MacBook Air. Today, we'll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Friday.MacBook Air : It looks like Apple may have been toying with the idea of a faster MacBook Air , reports MacRumors . Benchmark results for a faster device showed up last week on Geekbench. This device was using an Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) i7 processor. This is different from the current MacBook Air line, which only features an i5 processor. The model number of the device is also different from any current MacBook on the market.Mac mini : Owners of the Mac mini won't have much trouble with repairs , iFixit notes. The teardown of the Mac mini shows that it isn't difficult to get inside the device for repairs. This makes sense as AAPL did design the device so that certain components could be upgraded. This results in the Mac mini taking home a repairability score of six out of 10 from iFixit . The closer to 10 a score is the easier the device is to repair.Holiday Survey : One survey shows that customers are hoping to get their hands on Apple products this year , reports BGR . The survey comes from Gazelle and it tracks customer wants. When it comes to tech, AAPL devices take three of the top four spots. The top spot belongs to Samsung Galaxy. However, the second, third and fourth spots on the list are taken by the iPhone, iPad and MacBook.The post Friday Apple Rumors: i7 MacBook Air May Have Been in the Works appeared first on InvestorPlace .
Continued, Reliable Improvements Make Microsoft Stock a Smart Choice
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor a brief moment, and we are talking just a few months, Microsoft  (NASDAQ: MSFT ) lost title of "second most valuable company" to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). That changed when Amazon fell to $1500 a share. Microsoft stock had a strong quarter, and the company regained the title. Since the market's rebound, Microsoft and Amazon.com now have virtually the same market capitalization.Realistically, though, the company with the bigger market cap will shift back and forth for the foreseeable future. What matters is what happens to Microsoft's fair value in the quarters ahead.Microsoft reported solid results. This time, Surface was one of the many bright spots, in addition to Cloud and Gaming. Overall, revenue rose an impressive 18.6% from last year to $29.1 billion.The company issued an upbeat forecast. Most notably, Dynamics will deliver $2.5 billion in revenue due mostly to the strength of Dynamics 365. To drive demand in this quarter, Microsoft will introduce Dynamics AI.Dynamics AI is an entirely new suite of tools for customers. The 'AI' takes the system of record and engagement and converts it into intelligence. The Mixed Reality tool digitizes physical space and interactions, which customers use to then digitize the critical business process.The Productivity and Business Processes unit grew 19% Y/Y to $9.8 billion, exceeding expectations. Both on-premise (which just means on-site) and cloud drove sales in the quarter.Unsurprisingly, Office 365 commercial subscriptions added to favorably to results. ARPU keeps going up, thanks to customers moving from an "E3" workload on to a more expensive "E5" workload.LinkedIn also performed well. Revenue grew by 33%. The profitability from the job site offset a slight increase in operating expenses and lower gross margin.Revenue from Intelligent Cloud grew a very nice 24% to $8.6 billion. Strong demand for hybrid offerings led the unit's performance.With numbers like this, it is little wonder that International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE: IBM ) is willing to overpay for Redhat to the tune of $34 billion. This acquisition fills IBM's gap in hybrid cloud solutions but does not solve underlying weaknesses in its other business units.Investors should stay away from IBM despite the attractive dividend yield of 5.44% and consider Microsoft stock instead. IBM may trade at a P/E of nine times, almost three-fold less than Microsoft's 25 times P/E, but the latter will keep growing at a solid pace.Granted, Microsoft's on-premise and enterprise services units grew at "only" 10% and 6%, the overall revenue growth is sustainable. IBM still needs to figure out how to get rid of or reboot its legacy businesses. And those segments make up a big portion of total revenue for IBM.Bing, a search engine that is both inferior and unknown to users, still grew in revenue by 17%. Surface, which started out as a money-losing business, grew in revenue by 14%, thanks to Surface Book 2 and Surface Go.Apple  (NASDAQ: AAPL ) announced an incremental upgrade to its MacBook Air and iPad Pro but fell short in a big way. The iPhone giant still started the base MacBook Air with a measly 120GB of SSD storage.Plus, the Apple computers include last-generation Core Processors from Intel  (NASDAQ: INTC ). The iPad Pro lacks an earphone jack, forcing users to pay an extra $9 for it. Such annoyances will only benefit Microsoft's hardware business. Consumers will choose a fully functional Surface device over Apple hardware.MSFT stock bottomed at around $105 during October's rout and the downtrend appears over. When considering valuations and profit growth potential, Microsoft shareholders, not Amazon.com, will enjoy another ride up.Disclosure: The author does not own shares in any of the companies mentioned.The post Continued, Reliable Improvements Make Microsoft Stock a Smart Choice appeared first on InvestorPlace .
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you're looking for reasons why Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) stock dropped nearly 3% yesterday, the House of Mouse definitely played a part. Yesterday, Disney (NYSE: DIS ) reported its Q4 earnings and as part of that event, the company officially announced the name of its new streaming video service. Disney+ will be coming for Netflix - and gutting some of the most popular content in its library - in late 2019. And that's bad news for Netflix stock.The big question for NFLX investors will be whether Disney+ will steal customers from Netflix, or whether consumers will subscribe to both.We've known for a while that Disney would be launching its own video streaming service. We've known that it would be coming sometime in 2019, and that it would leverage Disney's deep library of content. After all, Disney not only has decades worth of its own movies and animated features to draw from, it has ABC's TV series and it owns the Marvel and Star Wars film franchises.Oh, and don't forget Disney's purchase of Fox was approved this year as well, adding yet more TV content and movie franchises like Deadpool, Alien and X-Men. And the company has been announcing a growing number of original series that will be released exclusively on its new streaming platform.Now we finally know the name, and have a better idea of the timeframe. Disney+ will be launching in late 2019. As of yesterday, it even has an official website .We've also known prior to yesterday's Disney+ announcement that Disney will yank its key franchises from Netflix in 2019.That means no more Marvel, Star Wars or Disney movies on Netflix. That alone is a big blow to NFLX, because these are popular movies and big draws. When you look at the top movies released so far in 2018 , Disney accounts for the top three highest grossing releases. And between Disney itself, Marvel and Star Wars, the company has five of the 10 most popular movies this year. Throw that 20th Century Fox acquisition in the mix, and Disney properties account for six out of 10 of the highest grossing (and most popular) movies of 2018.The number one movie of 2018, "Black Panther" is expected to be the final Marvel movie to be offered on Netflix before Disney turns off the tap.Disney+ represents a big headache for Netflix that hits just as the company is dealing with a slew of challenges. The company is having to spend big on original programming to attract new subscribers and keep the ones it has. That means more borrowing to finance content . The company has been experimenting with measures like displaying ads to help offset these costs, but that's a risky move given many people jumped to streaming video to avoid commercials. Netflix could end up losing a big chunk of subscribers if it went that route.Raising prices is also an option , but the pricing of its competition could be a limiter. Unlike streaming music services (which all cluster around a $9.99 price point) streaming video services have some differentiation in pricing. But if Disney+ comes in with a low monthly fee, NFLX could risk customers jumping ship if it were to increase its rates.Disney+ is arriving at the same time that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is expected to launch its streaming video service. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) continues to grow its video offering and even Walmart (NYSE: WMT ) is reported to be working on a streaming video service .While Disney+ will have an advantage over Netflix in its collection of blockbuster hit movies, NFLX will still have a deep catalog of content, including its massive investment in original series over the year. Popular shows like "House of Cards," "Stranger Things," "Orange is the New Black" and "BoJack Horseman" are Netflix exclusives. It will take competitors like Disney+ and Apple a long time to build up the same depth of original content. And NFLX will hardly be standing still while its new competition ramps up.Still, the official announcement of Disney+ is a bit nerve wracking to NFLX investors, and that reminder of what's coming in 2019 could be seen in the hit Netflix stock took yesterday.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s.The post Look Out Netflix, Disney+ Is Coming appeared first on InvestorPlace .
Weighed down by accelerating inflation and its likely impact on Federal Reserve monetary policy, slowing Chinese economic growth and lackluster corporate guidance, stocks were losing ground on Friday with the Nasdaq Composite again taking the full force of Wall Street's aversion to risk. Led by losses in component stocks Caterpillar ( CAT  ) and Apple ( AAPL  ), the Dow Jones Industrial Average is more than 200 points below the prior day's close.Despite Friday's negative price action, the benchmark averages are all indicated to close higher for a second consecutive week.
 By Jeffrey Dastin Nov 9 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc  on Friday said it would carry more Apple Inc  products globally in time for the holiday shopping season, as the technology rivals put aside past differences to boost sales. In coming weeks, the world's biggest online retailer will sell the latest editions of Apple's iPhone, iPad and other devices in the United States, Europe, Japan and India. Amazon sold a limited assortment from Apple previously that included Mac computers and Beats headphones. As of Jan. 4, Amazon will rid its site of Apple products from third-party merchants not authorized by the Cupertino, California-based technology company. Still, shoppers will be able to find non-branded accessories - like headphones - that are compatible with Apple devices. Third-party merchants will be allowed to sell as they have been through the holiday season, while Amazon will add Apple products to its official Apple at Amazon page. The lineup will include the Apple Watch but not the Apple HomePod, a high-end alternative to Amazon's voice-controlled Echo device. Such competition in Silicon Valley has often come at the expense of customers. Alphabet Inc'sGoogle pulled its video streaming app YouTube from two Amazon devices last year because of several complaints against the online retailer, including its decision not to sell some of Google's products.  Amazon now carries the Apple TV, but only after it became compatible with Amazon's Prime Video. "We're working with Amazon to improve the experience for Apple customers on their site and we look forward to those customers having another great way to buy iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac and more," Apple said in a statement. About 71 percent of Apple's sales in fiscal 2018, ended in September, were through indirect distribution channels like Amazon.

Despite Lacking a Permanent CEO, Intel Stock Could Be a Good Bet
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you're the kind of investor who "bets on the jockey, not the horse," placing bets on CEOs rather than focusing on the companies they run, you are missing out on the opportunity provided by  Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) stock.INTC has not had a full-time CEO since it parted ways with Brian Krzanich in June after he slept with an Intel employee. Since then, Intel's chief financial officer, Bob Swan, has also been its interim CEO.Swan insists he's not a candidate for the permanent CEO role. Some may think he should be.Under Swan, Intel has settled down to business, and business has been brisk. Its third-quarter report, delivered on Oct. 25, sent Intel stock flying. The chip maker reported net income of $6.4 billion, or $1.38 per share, on revenue of $19.2 billion. Who needs a jockey when you have a fast horse?Intel stock rallied after Swan raised the company's full-year estimates. Intel provided 2018 EPS guidance of $4.53 per share on revenue of $71.2 billion, up $1.7 billion from the guidance it delivered in July.Intel's data center group, which makes chips for cloud data centers, generated more year-over-year growth than any other unit. Its quarterly revenue came in at $6.1 billion, up 26% from a year earlier. But Intel's sales of chips for PCs were also up 16%, and its sales of flash memory were up 21%. Even its Mobileye unit, which makes products for self-driving cars, reported a top line of $496 million, up 6%.Intel is also benefiting from Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) fight with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ). INTC is slated to become Apple's sole supplier of iPhone modems in 2020,  when the iPhone is supposed to start utilizing 5G.That should be a major upgrade because 5G supports much, much-higher speeds than Apple's current products, and millions of Apple's customers will probably trade in their phones to get access to 5G.Despite Intel's great results, Intel stock is still cheap. The price-earnings ratio of INTC stock is just 17, and INTC stock trades at just three times the company's sales. It also has a dividend yield of 2.55%. If the company continues to devote 40% of its free cash flow to the dividend, the payout should rise 1.5 cents, to $1.26 per share in 2019 . Meanwhile, buybacks have cut the company's share count by 5% over the last five years.InvestorPlace's Luke Lango calls Intel "too attractive to pass up."  \Now might be the right time to grab it, he suggests, because Intel stock is almost certain to go higher when INTC names a new CEO.Intel, however, is still a troubled company. Its main issues involve its chip manufacturing, which is also known as its foundry.Rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM ) has plans to deliver chips to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) with circuit lines just seven nanometers apart next year, while Intel is still at ten nanometers.Intel is reportedly focusing on four candidates for the permanent CEO role.  Two are Qualcomm  executives and two are internal candidates. The company is apparently bypassing early favorite Diane Bryant , a veteran Intel executive who briefly helped run Google Cloud for Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ).If the new CEO can make the foundry great again, that would be enough to boost INTC stock.Despite running on what looks like autopilot, INTC is outperforming expectations. Intel stock looks cheap, the company is growing, and demand for its products keeps rising.But a riderless horse is risky. Any real crisis would knock this already troubled company severely off its stride. Nonetheless, it's really tempting to bet on this horse before its jockey is named.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include Fitbit FIT , Apple AAPL , Garmin GRMN and Fossil FOSL .Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst Blog:Smartwatch Showdown: Apple vs. FitbitRecently, wearables company Fitbit reported better-than-expected earnings thanks to the addition of new products. Fitbit is the number two player in the smartwatch area in the U.S., entering the market with zero share only 14 months ago. It is interesting to see that sales of smartwatches are still increasing, even though it seems as if the craze has died down. However, companies like Fitbit and Apple are coming out with newer versions of their smartwatches, which is continuing to entice consumers. So, let's take a closer look at Fitbit's Versa smartwatch and the Apple Watch Series 4.Fitbit Versa Fitbit sold 3.5 million wearable devices in the third quarter, with the average selling price up 3% year-over-year. Since the introduction of many new devices such as the Versa, Charge 3 and Aria 2, 62% of revenue came from these different wearables and smartwatches. More specifically, sales of the Versa smartwatch increased from the year-ago period, taking the lead over similar performers like Garmin, Samsung and Fossil. Throughout this year, the company has seen a 49% increase in revenue just from the Smartwatch sector of the company.In its Q3 report, CEO James Park mentioned that the company saw sequential growth in both tracker and smartwatch products throughout the year. Due to that, they are re-affirming their full year guidance of $1.5 billion.The watch has proved to be more popular among female consumers, making up almost 72% of consumers. A reason for this could be Fitbit's female health tracking feature, which has seen a lot of engagement since its launch. But if the company wants to see growth and success, they can't solely rely on the sales of their smartwatches. A lot of the company's products are fitness trackers, which have lacked sales in the past. In Fitbit's recent quarterly report, their full year 2018 guidance projects a decline in sales of tracker devices but an increase in sales of smartwatches. Although the company has seen a decline in sales until now, it is apparent that Fitbit is trying to turn things around and is sticking to its promise to deliver products that its consumers want.Apple Watch Series 4According to TechCrunch , the Series 4 Apple watch is the best, most accessible Apple Watch to date. Apple has a very die-hard consumer base and it's those consumers that buy almost all of Apple's new products. With a brand new design, features and updates, Apple has captured its consumers to buy the "perfect" smartwatch in the market right now.In Apple's Q4 report, the company reported revenue of almost $63 billion, an increase of 20% from the year-ago quarter. The company ended with a record year with September being their best quarter ever, growing double digits in a lot of the different segments. Although the company didn't specify numbers for the Apple watches, CEO Tim Cook mentioned that the company set records for iPhones and Wearables and that with the launch of many new products, they are entering the holiday season with their strongest lineup of products and services.If what Cook mentioned in the quarterly report to be true and that this will be their greatest holiday season ever, investors can look towards higher sales and more demand for Apple products in the upcoming months. It seems as though no matter what product or new update Apple comes out with, its most loyal customers will always have it. It's no surprise that investors have become used to Apple reporting better than expected results and saying only positives about the company in their press releases. Therefore, investors will look towards the individual units Apple produces and especially during the holiday season.Which Smartwatch Takes the Reign?It can be said that both brands of smartwatches have their pros and cons. Seeing as the Versa is almost half the price of the Series 4 and includes many of the same features, it would be reasonable to purchase the Versa over the Series 4 watch. However, for those consumers who are loyal to Apple's brand would lean more towards buying their products instead of Fitbit's. If we look towards the design and processing features of the Series 4, it can be said that more consumers would lean towards buying that. However, for those looking to buy a simpler and cheaper version of Apple's smartwatch, Fitbit would be your best bet with its Versa smartwatch.Bottom LineIt is clear that Apple has consumers buying their watches and it's also clear that people are buying Fitbit's Versa smartwatch. However, during Q3, Fitbit's competition wasn't as stiff as it will be now. Apple's Series 4 watch came out at the end of Q3, so there wasn't really much to compare to. But with the holiday season coming up, both companies can look towards competition with their respective products.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.

Pre-Market Most Active for Nov 9, 2018 :  GE, ACRX, FNSR, AMD, QQQ, AR, YELP, SQQQ, HSBC, BABA, AAPL, ACB
The NASDAQ 100 Pre-Market Indicator  is down -50.62 to 7,107.97. The total Pre-Market volume is currently 5,161,815 shares traded.      The following are the  most active stocks for the pre-market session  : 
 By Sruthi Shankar Nov 9 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 fell more than 1 percent on Friday, with shares of large technology, industrial and material companies taking a hit as weak Chinese data and a slide in oil prices raised concerns about global growth. The S&P technology index  fell 1.9 percent as Apple Inc  dropped 2.4 percent and semiconductor stocks  tumbled 2.1 percent. "When you look overseas, there's not just concerns about a global slowdown, but a global recession that might be brewing," said Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer of Santa Ana, California-based First American Trust.

In the backdrop of a bitter trade dispute between the Washington and Beijing, Chinese data showed producer inflation fell for the fourth straight month in October on cooling domestic demand and manufacturing activity, while car sales fell for a fourth consecutive month.

 By Cate Cadell WUZHEN, China, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Chinese news readers may have some new competition - artificially intelligent robot anchors that can mimic human facial expressions and mannerisms while reading out reports. The AI anchor, developed by state news agency Xinhua and tech firm Sogou Inc, was on display at the World Internet Conference in the eastern Chinese town of Wuzhen, drawing in curious passers-by. In another video presentation from Xinhua, a different robot presenter said it was his "very first day" at the news agency and promised to "work tirelessly to keep you informed as texts will be typed into my system uninterrupted". At the internet summit, Sogou marketing staff said it wasn't clear when the technology would actually go into use, but crowds gathered nonetheless to take selfies with the digital anchor and Qiu himself who was at the event. The conference is China's top tech event of the year, and has in the past attracted names like Apple Inc  CEO Tim Cook and Alphabet Inc  head Sundar Pichai. This year's iteration, however, which opened on Wednesday, was more muted and has a less glitzy global line-up, even as battle lines for control of the web have hardened amid a biting trade war between China and the United States.  Foreign websites such as Alphabet's Google and Facebook Inc  are blocked in China, where authorities also tightly control online content and censor or punish those who post material seen as opposed to "core socialist values". 
 
 By Akanksha Rana and Uday Sampath Kumar Nov 9 (Reuters) - Laser and optical parts maker II-VI Inc  said on Friday it would buy Apple Inc supplier Finisar Corp  for about $3.2 billion, to grab a bigger slice of 5G investments and sell more sensors for iPhones and driverless cars. II-VI will pay Finisar shareholders $26 per share, in cash and stock, a premium of 37.7 percent to Finisar's closing share price on Thursday.  The combined company would make a range of transceivers to help transfer high-speed data traffic through undersea cables and 5G networks. Global telecom companies are spending billions to develop 5G networks, which will rely on denser arrays of small antennas to offer data speeds up to 50 or 100 times faster than current 4G networks. II-VI, pronounced as two-six, was founded in 1971 to make optical compounds used to make solar cells, lasers and transistors. The company is also targeting the fast-growing market for 3D sensing technology used for facial recognition in smartphones and detecting obstacles by self-driving cars. Both the companies supply parts to Apple, but Finisar, which makes lasers that power iPhone Face ID, has an edge following an investment of $390 million from Apple in December.  The deal could give II-VI the scale and products needed to woo new customers as demand for 3D sensing technology grows among smartphone manufacturers. II-VI's Chief Executive Officer Vincent Mattera Jr told Reuters that the company has been engaged in talks with a large number of potential new customers but did not disclose any names. "We are being selective and they would not be surprises to most people who are in this space," Mattera said. Finisar and II-VI have been battling tough competition from Lumentum Holdings Inc  and NeoPhotonics Corp  in the 3D sensing technology market.  "Due to Finisar's connection with Apple as a VCSEL (vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser) supplier for facial recognition, this strengthens II-VI's VCSEL opportunity at Apple," Benchmark Co analyst Mark Miller said. II-VI, which has a market value of about $3 billion, said it intends to fund the deal with cash reserves of both companies, a $2 billion debt raise and $1.4 billion of new equity issued to Finisar shareholders. The deal is expected to close in the middle of 2019. BofA Merrill Lynch is the financial adviser to II-VI, while Barclays advised Finisar.

AmEx wins China approval to clear card payments
 BEIJING, Nov 9 (Reuters) - American Express Co  on Friday won approval to clear card payments in China, making it the first U.S. card network to gain direct access to what is set to be the biggest bank card market by 2020. The move comes months after Beijing started allowing foreign companies to apply for licenses and ahead of a G20 meeting in Argentina where the United States and China will try to resolve their trade disputes. The preliminary approval allows the company to process and settle payments in yuan domestically by setting up its own network with its Chinese joint venture partner LianLian Group. AmEx's JV, named Express (Hangzhou) Technology Services Co, is required to complete operation preparations within a year and get a nod from the central bank before running the card clearing business, the People's Bank of China said in a statement on its website. The approval is a "significant step toward opening up China's bank card market to foreign investors", the central bank said, adding that it would continue to ease in an orderly way market access for clearing and settlement institutions. Up until now, foreign card companies have had to partner with China's UnionPay, a state-controlled consortium that enjoyed a monopoly on all yuan payment cards issued and used in the country, for access to the country's payments network. Foreign card companies, especially behemoths like Visa and Mastercard, have been lobbying for more than a decade for direct access to China - where the number of cards in circulation is expected to rise to 9 billion by 2020 from 6 billion in 2016, according to research firm GlobalData Plc. UnionPay counts Visa, Mastercard, and Apple Inc  among its partners for payments-related services in China. Visa was the first to submit its application for a license in July 2017 but its request was put on hold and the company was asked to firm up its local equity partnership before resubmitting its application, sources told Reuters last year (graphic). Mastercard told Reuters on Friday that it would continue to remain engaged with regulators during the application process. 
 
 We're now approaching the two-year anniversary of   Qualcomm    's (NASDAQ: QCOM) massive legal battle with   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) , which has been   wrecking both sides    of Qualcomm's business ever since. First filed in   January 2017    , the dispute rages on unabated, despite Qualcomm initially   thinking it could find a way to settle with the Mac maker. At   this point, Apple has already shifted all of its new   business to rival   Intel    , although Qualcomm still sells modems for older iDevices.Qualcomm reported fiscal fourth-quarter results last   night, and the ongoing fight continues to weigh on its   business.  You won't find Qualcomm modems in Apple's latest iPhones.     Image source: Apple.Revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter declined 2% to $5.8   billion, which included $4.6 billion in QCT (the chip business)   sales and $1.1 billion in QTL (the licensing business) revenue.   Operating expenses were $6.5 billion, leading to an operating   loss of $654 million. Net loss was $493 million, or $0.35 per   share. There is still $1.7 billion worth of royalty revenue from   fiscal 2017 hanging in the balance, as Apple had previously   instructed its contract manufacturers not to pay Qualcomm.Apple's shift to Intel hurt Qualcomm's forecast for the fiscal   first quarter. While Qualcomm had already expected as much, the   outlook fell short of expectations. The mobile chip giant   predicts revenue next quarter will be in the range of $4.5   billion to $5.3 billion, with non-   GAAP    earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.15. That top-line outlook is   well below the $5.6 billion in revenue that analysts were   modeling for."The combined impact of Apple instructing their contract   manufacturers to stop paying their contracted royalty payments   and Apple's decision to use a competitor's modem for their latest   device has had a significant impact to our financial   performance," CEO Steve Mollenkopf said on   the earnings call    . "Notably, over 50% of the expected fiscal 2019 headwind related   to Apple is reflected in our first fiscal quarter guidance, it   impacts our QCT business."In other words, most of the impact will be concentrated in the   December quarter, the busiest time for iPhone sales. Qualcomm   expects its modem volumes to Apple will be down a whopping 50   million to 55 million compared to a year ago, when Qualcomm was   still supplying roughly half of all iPhone modems.Qualcomm continues marching toward a resolution, but it's   going to take time. Here's Mollenkopf:Regarding Apple, our view on the timeline to resolve our     licensing dispute has not changed. We have previously     highlighted key litigation milestones in fiscal 2019 that we     believe could help drive a resolution. Those litigation     milestones have not changed, including the potential for     multiple patent infringement rulings in China and Germany     before the end of this calendar year.Aside from infringement of unlicensed intellectual property     and other claims, including the recent product-related claims,     there are billions of dollars in damages in the breach of     contract claims against Apple's manufacturers. We expect a     trial date to be set for that matter in San Diego during the     early part of next year.After ongoing escalations around the world, the fight turns 2   years old in January. If the companies are unable to settle their   differences, a full-blown trial will only prolong the episode   further.  10 stocks we like better than Qualcomm       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

 Shares of Disney DIS  popped after-hours on the back of an earnings and revenue beat, along with a strong showing at the box office. Investors were also likely pleased to hear more streaming updates as the media power prepares to launch its Netflix NFLX  rival late next year.But we still need to understand how Disney's individual business units compared to estimates. Overview Disney's plan to acquire major 21st Century Fox FOXA  entertainment assets earned approval  from the European Commission earlier this week. The EU, the U.S. Justice Department, and both companies' shareholders have now approved the deal.Disney now looks set to offer three stand-alone streaming platforms-ESPN+, Hulu, and its Disney-branded platform-as it aims to stand out against Netflix, Amazon AMZN  , and soon Apple AAPL  and AT&T T  . With that said, the company's Q4 results had little to do with its streaming future.     Fourth Quarter Disney's adjusted quarterly earnings surged 38% from $1.07 per share in the year-ago quarter to reach $1.48 per share. This crushed our $1.31 per share Zacks Consensus Estimate.Meanwhile, at the top of the income statement, the company's Q4 revenues climbed 12% to reach $14.307 billion, which also came in well above our $13.81 billion estimate. "We're very pleased with our financial performance in fiscal 2018, delivering record revenue, net income and earnings per share," CEO Bob Iger said in a company statement.  Now let's see how the firm performed in its key units. Media Networks Let's start with Disney's Media Networks unit, which is comprised of its cable and broadcast division. Media Networks revenues popped 9% to reach $5.963 billion. This came in well above our $5.688 billion NFM estimate. The company's broadcasting revenues soared 21%, while its ESPN-driven cable unit popped 5%. Parks and Resorts Disney's Park and Resorts revenues were expected to jump 11.5% from $4.667 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 to reach $5.204 billion. Instead, Disney's theme park and resort revenues climbed only 9% to $5.070 billion. Studio Entertainment Disney's Studio Entertainment division proved to be the big Q4 winner. The division's revenues skyrocketed 50% from $1.432 billion to land at $2.151 billion. Our estimates projected Studio Entertainment would climb by 27.5% to $1.826 billion.Investors should remember that Studio Entertainment is Disney's most volatile segment. For instance, Studio Entertainment revenues sunk 21% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and surged 20% in Q3. Disney said the 50% growth was driven by the success of Incredibles 2  and Ant-Man and the Wasp  , which were pretty much only going up against Cars 3  in the year-ago period.

 The tyranny of high expectations took another swipe at tech   superstar   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) late last week after it reported on its fiscal   fourth quarter. Profits were way up, but because the actual   number of iPhones sold was close to flat, investors sold off the   stock. The Apple bears want to take this as a sign that the   company is losing its luster. Management, meanwhile, has said   it's going to stop reporting on unit sales at all. But is there   really an issue for investors to worry about? What are the real   takeaways from fiscal Q4?In this segment from    Motley Fool Money     , host Chris Hill chats with senior analysts Ron Gross, Matt   Argersinger, and Jason Moser about the outlook for the company,   its headwinds, and its tailwinds.A full transcript follows the video.     10 stocks we like better than Walmart       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

This video was recorded on Nov. 2, 2018.  Chris Hill    : Fourth quarter profits for Apple up 41% compared to a year ago.   But, shares of Apple falling 6% on Friday after iPhone sales came   in flat year over year. Jason, a lot of grousing among Wall   Street analysts about this one. Jason Moser:    Let's everybody just take a step back. Let's keep things in   context here. Bears will try to frame this quarter and the   information we gleaned from the quarter into some   earth-shattering move that shows that Apple's best days are   behind it. That's just not the case. The big noise that's being   made is that management is going to stop reporting unit sales for   iPhones, iPads, Macs. When you want to steer your identity away   from being primarily a phone company, this is a logical decision.   "Hey, let's not worry about being so granular." And I think   management's point on the call is actually right in that today, a   unit of sale is less relevant for them than it was in the past.   If you look at iPhones alone, there are a lot of different models   now. You've got enough models to accommodate a very big market.   It's not necessarily indicative of the health of the business   because they're also selling iPads and Macs, but even more so the   Services side of the business. And there is something to be said   for the Wearables side of the business, as well.They're witnessing some pricing pressures in emerging markets.   Not terribly surprising. Average selling prices are not going to   go to the moon. They also made the point that they released the   most expensive line of phones here first, and the cheaper line of   phones is going to be coming out this quarter. It was the   opposite last year. That average selling price that was so high   this quarter, reasonable to assume it'll probably be a little bit   lower next quarter. But at the end of the day, these guys are   selling millions and millions of iPhones. I don't think that's   going to stop. If anything, maybe we see a little bit of time   between replacements now, because phones are better and we're   getting more time out of the phones that we buy. But they've   still got quite the loyal customer base. I think things are going   to be OK. Ron Gross:    I think there were probably a lot of disappointed analysts out   there who will no longer get quarterly unit data. We're all paid   to opine on a quarterly basis about the health of Apple and all   the other companies we follow. But for shareholders, I don't   really think it matters. I'd love to see that data released on an   annual basis, so we can calm down on a quarterly basis, and just   look at things annually. But I'm not actually sure they're even   going to do that. I would encourage them to give us data on a   yearly basis. Moser:    I will say, on the flip side of this, because they are focusing   the business more on the Services aspect, they are going to give   us a little bit more information in regard to that. We're not   only going to get the revenue that the Services segment   generates, but also the costs involved with that revenue. We'll   be able to see how profitable that is and start looking ahead to   see how profitable it can one day become. Matt Argersinger:    Can we also just mention that Apple has more cash on its balance   sheet than the size of all but 10 companies on the planet? It's a   remarkable number. I know we talk about it every quarter, and   it's not surprising, but it's still just remarkable to me. Moser:    The bottom line with this, and what I think investors want to   know -- what do I do? Is this a problem? Is this a crisis? Do I   need to sell my Apple shares? Absolutely not. This is just as   good a business today as it was yesterday before they announced   these results. If you're a shareholder in Apple, you need to hang   on to those shares, knowing that you're an owner of one of the   most important companies in the world.

3 Top Value Stocks to Buy in November
   Image source: Getty Images.Almost everyone hates market corrections -- except for   value-minded investors, who like to keep some cash on hand to go   shopping when stocks go on sale. And after October 2018, they may   have just that opportunity.It takes some real nerve to buy when everyone else says   "sell," but a quality company at the right price can mean a great   long-term reward. Here are three value stocks that are worth a   look right now:   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) ,   Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings    (NASDAQ: AAWW) , and   General Motors    (NYSE: GM) .  Nicholas Rossolillo     (Apple):    Quarterly earnings season is crazy. Navigating through the noise   to determine why Wall Street reacted the way it did to business   results is confounding, and sometimes completely devoid of good   sense.Take Apple's fiscal   fourth quarter    ended Sept. 29. I can understand investors' worry over almost   nonexistent iPhone sales growth and weaker-than-hoped-for sales   guidance for the iPhone, the flagship product that still   dictates Apple's trajectory over a decade after its debut. Some   may also be concerned about Apple deciding it will no longer   provide specific unit sales numbers on its devices. That's also   somewhat understandable.What I can't understand is the concern over   slowing iPhone sales,     which have been a reality for some time now. Apple's   response has been to take the high road, increasing the premium   image of its smartphones via advanced tech and higher pricing.   That strategy -- a risky endeavor for anyone other than Apple --   has been a resounding success.Average selling price during the fourth quarter was $793, a   28% increase over a year ago. Recurring sales from services have   also been on the rise, up 17% in the last quarter. All of that   led to 20% and 41% higher revenue and earnings, respectively,   versus the same period a year ago.Nevertheless, investors decided this time around that the   slowdown in units sold was too much, and shares were punished. A   quarter ago, pundits were lining up to talk about when Apple   would reach $2 trillion in valuation. Now the   arbitrary $1 trillion milestone    is at risk.Don't mind the talking heads. What this means is that   long-term and levelheaded investors get to consider scooping up   this best-in-class growth-at-a-value stock at a big discount from   recent highs. With a one-year trailing P/E of 17.5 and a one-year   forward P/E of just 13.7, Apple looks like a real bargain, even   if growth starts to slow down a bit.  The new iPhone XS Max. Image source: Apple.  Chuck Saletta  (Atlas Air Worldwide):    The aircraft leasing business is inherently difficult to compete   in. It's capital intensive, as aircraft can easily cost hundreds   of millions of dollars. Yet despite the   financial    barriers to entry, competition can move spare capacity from where   it sits to where it's needed in a matter of hours simply by   flying its equipment around. As a result, it can be incredibly   tough for any one company to earn an excessively high return on   its capital.Still, as Atlas Air Worldwide has frequently shown, it is   possible to profitably run a business in the industry. The   company recently reported quarterly earnings of $1.54 per share,   adjusted for one-time events, exceeding the market's   expectations.  Despite that profitability, the market's   treatment of Atlas shares makes it an interesting value to   consider buying now.First, along with much of the market, Atlas shares fell in   October. In this particular case, they fell to their 52-week lows   and have only recently started bouncing back. Second, thanks in   part to that decline, it trades at a mere 0.8 price-to-book   ratio. The first point makes it cheaper for today's investors   than it was just a couple of months ago, while the second makes   it less expensive to   buy the company outright    than to replicate its asset base.Because of the nature of its business, it's unlikely that   Atlas Air Worldwide will ever trade at a high multiple to its   sales or earnings. Still, the market's moves in October set up an   opportunity for value seekers to consider buying its shares at a   decent price in November.  Daniel Miller    (General Motors):     Many Americans will do traditional retail shopping in   November. But if you're out shopping for stocks this month   instead, General Motors is looking like a great value right now.   November could be a solid month to take a second look at   Detroit's largest automaker fresh off its strong third-quarter   results.On the last day of October, GM reported profits that topped   analysts' estimates and announced better-than-expected guidance   for the fourth quarter. Adjusted EPS checked in at $1.87, an   impressive 41.7% gain from the prior year, and well ahead of   analysts' call for $1.26. GM's third-quarter revenue moved 6.4%   higher to $35.8 billion, which also topped analysts' expectations   for $34.84 billion. In summary, at a time when analysts were   concerned about higher commodity costs and tariffs, GM managed to   report higher revenues, profits, and margins.November is also a good time to look GM over for a couple of   additional reasons. Currently, it trades at a forward P/E of   about 6, which makes it incredibly cheap compared with the   broader markets. That low valuation has also pushed its dividend   yield up to 4.2%.And GM's new full-size pickups have just begun arriving at   dealerships and should drive average transaction prices even   higher in the near term. There's even near-term upside with the   Cadillac brand, which carries higher margins than mainstream   brands, as it plans to launch a new model every six months   through 2020.Sure, the North American new-vehicle market is at the top of   the current cycle, but GM is cheap and could be a great value   stock with its dividend yield and its new trucks coming to   market.

Smartwatch Showdown: Apple (AAPL) vs. Fitbit (FIT)
 Recently, wearables company Fitbit FIT  reported better-than-expected earnings thanks to the addition of new products. Fitbit is the number two player in the smartwatch area in the U.S., entering the market with zero share only 14 months ago. It is interesting to see that sales of smartwatches are still increasing, even though it seems as if the craze has died down. However, companies like Fitbit and Apple AAPL  are coming out with newer versions of their smartwatches, which is continuing to entice consumers. So, let's take a closer look at Fitbit's Versa smartwatch and the Apple Watch Series 4. Fitbit Versa  Fitbit sold 3.5 million wearable devices in the third quarter, with the average selling price up 3% year-over-year. Since the introduction of many new devices such as the Versa, Charge 3 and Aria 2, 62% of revenue came from these different wearables and smartwatches. More specifically, sales of the Versa smartwatch increased from the year-ago period, taking the lead over similar performers like Garmin GRMN  , Samsung SSNLF  and Fossil FOSL  . Throughout this year, the company has seen a 49% increase in revenue just from the Smartwatch sector of the company.In its Q3 report, CEO James Park mentioned that the company saw sequential growth in both tracker and smartwatch products throughout the year. Due to that, they are re-affirming their full year guidance of $1.5 billion.The watch has proved to be more popular among female consumers, making up almost 72% of consumers. A reason for this could be Fitbit's female health tracking feature, which has seen a lot of engagement since its launch. But if the company wants to see growth and success, they can't solely rely on the sales of their smartwatches. A lot of the company's products are fitness trackers, which have lacked sales in the past. In Fitbit's recent quarterly report, their full year 2018 guidance projects a decline in sales of tracker devices but an increase in sales of smartwatches. Although the company has seen a decline in sales until now, it is apparent that Fitbit is trying to turn things around and is sticking to its promise to deliver products that its consumers want. Apple Watch Series 4 According to TechCrunch  , the Series 4 Apple watch is the best, most accessible Apple Watch to date. Apple has a very die-hard consumer base and it's those consumers that buy almost all of Apple's new products. With a brand new design, features and updates, Apple has captured its consumers to buy the "perfect" smartwatch in the market right now.In Apple's Q4 report, the company reported revenue of almost $63 billion, an increase of 20% from the year-ago quarter. The company ended with a record year with September being their best quarter ever, growing double digits in a lot of the different segments. Although the company didn't specify numbers for the Apple watches, CEO Tim Cook mentioned that the company set records for iPhones and Wearables and that with the launch of many new products, they are entering the holiday season with their strongest lineup of products and services.If what Cook mentioned in the quarterly report to be true and that this will be their greatest holiday season ever, investors can look towards higher sales and more demand for Apple products in the upcoming months. It seems as though no matter what product or new update Apple comes out with, its most loyal customers will always have it. It's no surprise that investors have become used to Apple reporting better than expected results and saying only positives about the company in their press releases. Therefore, investors will look towards the individual units Apple produces and especially during the holiday season. Which Smartwatch Takes the Reign? It can be said that both brands of smartwatches have their pros and cons. Seeing as the Versa is almost half the price of the Series 4 and includes many of the same features, it would be reasonable to purchase the Versa over the Series 4 watch. However, for those consumers who are loyal to Apple's brand would lean more towards buying their products instead of Fitbit's. If we look towards the design and processing features of the Series 4, it can be said that more consumers would lean towards buying that. However, for those looking to buy a simpler and cheaper version of Apple's smartwatch, Fitbit would be your best bet with its Versa smartwatch. Bottom Line It is clear that Apple has consumers buying their watches and it's also clear that people are buying Fitbit's Versa smartwatch. However, during Q3, Fitbit's competition wasn't as stiff as it will be now. Apple's Series 4 watch came out at the end of Q3, so there wasn't really much to compare to. But with the holiday season coming up, both companies can look towards competition with their respective products. Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSamsung has been dropping hints for weeks that it is ready to show off its rumored foldable smartphone. Yesterday, the South Korean company did just that. At its annual developer conference in San Francisco, Samsung showed off the prototype of a device that looks like a typical smartphone at first glance, but it opens up to reveal a display the size of a small tablet.Making things even more interesting Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google announced it is including support for a new "Foldables" category in Android.What does this development mean for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL )? The company has defined smartphone design for the past decade. Sales of pricey iPhones have pushed AAPL stock to stratospheric levels. But Samsung could now be in a position to leapfrog Tim Cook & Co.We've heard rumors for quite some time, and Samsung had begun openly teasing about it in recent days. On Nov. 7, the company used its annual developer conference keynote to finally take the wraps off its foldable smartphone.The lights were dim, and the device was covered in extra plastic to disguise its appearance. But there was no mistaking what the company was showing off.What appeared to be a typical smartphone was opened up to reveal a display within that was the size of a small tablet screen. Not two displays joined by a hinge, but a single panel that bent seamlessly when closed. Samsung is calling that bendable panel the Infinity Flex Display, and says that it will go into mass production in a "matter of months."The outside of the foldable smartphone has an independent display, so it can be used in the usual fashion. Open it up, and the user has access to that 7.3-inch Infinity Flex Display. For point of comparison, Apple's iPad Mini has a 7.9-inch display. Someone carrying the new Samsung smartphone truly would have both a phone and a tablet in their pocket.Samsung says up to three apps will be able to run simultaneously, and that the Infinity Flex Display can be folded hundreds of thousands of times without damage. While the company didn't say specifically when it would release the foldable smartphone - which will likely end up being the Galaxy X - Google told attendees at its own conference that Samsung plans to introduce the new device early in 2019 .Samsung and Google don't always see eye-to-eye. With the introduction of Google's Pixel phones, they have become rivals in the flagship Android smartphone market. However, sensing an opportunity to take a leadership position over Apple (and no doubt worried about the risk of further fragmentation without official support), yesterday Google announced support for the Samsung smartphone in Android. A new "Foldable" device category has been added , standardizing screen continuity for developers.That's a good thing because, while Samsung has the spotlight, a California-based startup already unveiled its own foldable smartphone: the $1,300 Royole FlexPai .For years, Android smartphone manufacturers have followed Apple's design lead for smartphones. That's continued right up to the current generation and the adding of an iPhone X-like notch to their display  - even in cases where a notch isn't actually required.Being the leader that others follow has helped Apple to raise iPhone prices to levels other smartphone companies wouldn't dream of. And it's pushed Apple stock to the point where it is a trillion-dollar company.What happens when Samsung releases a foldable smartphone? With Android support, public fascination and more smartphone manufacturers taking interest in the form factor, Apple could quickly be left behind. A foldable smartphone that doubles as a tablet has a definite a "cool" factor. It also has huge potential in markets like India, where income levels don't support owning multiple devices. Yes, Apple has filed for several patents this year related to folding phones, but that's a long way from actually designing one.The company has already taken the unpopular step of announcing it will stop reporting iPhone sales numbers  amid slowing demand. What happens if AAPL is caught scrambling to play catch-up to a wave of folding smartphones that make the iPhone look like yesterday's tech? Samsung is hoping to find out next year, with the release of the Galaxy X.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s.The post Apple Could Be In Big Trouble With Samsung's 'Foldable' Phone appeared first on InvestorPlace .
Skyworks first-quarter forecast disappoints, shares fall
 Nov 8 (Reuters) - Skyworks Solutions Inc  forecast first-quarter revenue and profit below analysts' estimates, raising concerns of slowing demand for premium smartphones and sending its shares down 4 percent in extended trading. The company forecast first-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.91 per share and revenue of $1 billion to $1.02 billion. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $2.08 per share and revenue of $1.07 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Analysts have warned of cooling demand for smartphones in China, one of the biggest markets. Global smartphone shipments declined 3 percent annually, recording 386.8 million units in the third quarter, according to the latest research from Counterpoint's Market Monitor service. Net income rose to $285.5 million, or $1.58 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 28 from $281.3 million, or $1.51 per share, a year earlier.  Revenue rose 2.4 percent to $1.01 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $1 billion. Excluding certain items, Skyworks earned $1.94 per share, above estimates of $1.92. 
 
 Nov 8 (Reuters) - Analog chipmaker Skyworks Solutions Inc  reported a 2.4 percent rise in fourth-quarter revenue on Thursday, as more of its chips found space in Apple Inc's  new iPhones. Net income rose to $285.5 million, or $1.58 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 28 from $281.3 million, or $1.51 per share, a year earlier.  Revenue rose to $1.01 billion from $984.6 million. 
 By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - World equity markets declined on Thursday, snapping a seven-session winning streak, with U.S. stocks on the defensive and the dollar strengthening after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged. The U.S. central bank held rates steady and said ongoing strong job gains and household spending had kept the economy on track. Its statement showed little change in the Fed's outlook for the economy since the Fed's previous meeting in September aside from noting that "business investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year."  A spate of weak earnings also gave investors reason for pause, with Qualcomm  one of the biggest drags on the benchmark S&P 500 index, down 8.2 percent as the loss of chip sales to Apple  caused the company to cut its fourth-quarter outlook.  "There are those people who are unsatisfied by this statement because they were looking for a more dovish tone after last month's market volatility," said Gene Tannuzzo, deputy global head of fixed income at Columbia Threadneedle In Minneapolis. "That's why we see short-term yields ticked up and stocks down here. They are still on track." The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 11.12 points, or 0.04 percent, to 26,191.42, the S&P 500  lost 7.05 points, or 0.25 percent, to 2,806.84 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 39.87 points, or 0.53 percent, to 7,530.89. European shares closed higher, led by banking shares  following results from names such as SocGen  and Commerzbank.  The pan-European STOXX 600 index  rose 0.19 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe  shed 0.28 percent. The dollar had advanced heading into the Fed statement and added to its gains after weakening in the prior session. Traders currently see a 71.4 percent chance the Fed will raise rates by a quarter percentage point at its December meeting, according to CME's FedWatch, up from 68.8 percent on Nov 1. The dollar index  rose 0.71 percent, with the euro  down 0.58 percent to $1.1358. Oil prices fell and WTI entered a bear market, down more than 20 percent from its Oct 3 high, as crude surrendered early gains as investors focused on swelling global supply, which is increasing faster than many had expected.  U.S. crude  settled down 1.62 percent at $60.67 a barrel and Brent  last settled at $70.65, down 1.97 percent. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes  last fell 8/32 in price to yield 3.241 percent, from 3.213 percent late on Wednesday.

 Morgan Stanley  is getting more optimistic about Apple's (AAPL) opportunity in services.The firm's analyst Katy Huberty raised her price target for  Apple stock  to $253 from $226, citing improving trends for the smartphone maker in Morgan Stanley's survey of consumers. She also reiterated her Overweight rating for the shares."We think the market underestimates both growth and value impact of Apple's Services business," she wrote on Wednesday. "With a maturing, more-engaged iOS user base and broadening portfolio of Services, we believe Services represents the key growth driver for Apple over the next 5 years."Apple shares were down slightly in morning trading Thursday to $207.93. Huberty's new price forecast represents about 22% upside to its current stock price. Read More:   Apple Stock Could Rise on a Change in iPhone   Sales Reporting  Huberty noted the firm's survey of 4,000 consumers revealed rising spending intentions for Apple's App Store, Music and Apple Pay offerings. She predicts the average annual spend per user for the company's services will rise to $220 by 2023 versus $120 today.      https://asset.barrons.com/dj-mg/dice/barrons-staffpicks-2d590600-c862-4394-b9d3-66b48c376d60/inset.json "Apple is transitioning to more-stable, higher-margin, Services-led growth," she wrote. "Accelerated Services growth, margin expansion, and cash return to shareholders are catalysts that can help sustainably re-rate shares."Huberty's price-target raise came just one week after she lowered her Apple stock forecast to $226 from $247 on Nov. 1. At the time, she cited recent valuation "multiple compression" among Services peers - including Spotify Technology  (SPOT), Netflix  (NFLX) and Amazon.com  (AMZN) - as the reason for her price target cut.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe death of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) stock is greatly exaggerated. With all of its competitors being miles behind, NFLX is the company to beat in the online streaming sector. And this is my trade thesis in Netflix stock for the next few months.Let me explain.As we all know by now, Netflix stock has taken a significant beating since its earnings report, but most of this was due to timing. The selloff in NFLX happened while Wall Street was in a phase where sellers were in control from global fears.Netflix fell 35% off its July highs, but the fall was not straight down. On every swing low, the bulls managed to recapture half of the dip. The most recent fall was from the strong earnings report. NFLX stock investors sold it down almost 30%, but it has since recovered half of it.So the idea is that this is a broken company and Wall Street thinks Netflix is a loser. My bet is that they are wrong. Uber fans of Netflix stock and perma-bears are both wrong, actually, and somewhere in the middle lies the truth. So my enthusiasm for the stock is tempered, but there is still a lot of upside potential to it.The Nextflix stumble is not all intrinsic to its fundamentals. This is a momentum stock and they tend to move fast in either direction, which makes them hard to trade. They never give traders a clear entry point. On the way down they look like they are falling into an abyss, so the myth that it's dead money grows quickly.Perception is not reality, however. While sentiment is that this stock is a forgone loss, year-to-date, NFLX stock is still up almost 60%, while the Nasdaq Composite is struggling to hold the flat line.Fundamentally it is expensive. NFLX sells at a 107 price-to-earnings ratio. This is even more expensive than Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and more than twice as expensive as Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ). Apple (NASDA: AAPL ) and Facebook (NASDA: FB ) are five times cheaper, so one can argue that it's bloated, even after this big correction.But this is not a value trade. Netflix stock is a hyper growth stock, so I don't really need to see value to trade it. Yes, it burns a lot of cash to generate content, but that is its best ace up its sleeve. Their shows are in demand and people are signing up in droves. This is not a U.S. story. Its global expansion was once in doubt but no longer. They are succeeding abroad too and this is a big world.Media experts tend to measure metrics in terms of household to evaluate potential. NFLX is a personal experience; it's a device metric not a household. So every smart phone on the planet is a potential customer and that is a massive number. The leader in the space is best set to gain the business and, for now, that's Netflix.There are reasons to worry for the long term. Competition is fierce, especially from Disney (NYSE: DIS ) and the mega social media companies like GOOGL and FB, but I believe that management is up to the task. When everyone is busy playing catch-up, NFLX is aggressively implementing its expansion plans globally and it has a lot more room to run.The stock market in general was also responsible for a lot of the selling in NFLX stock and once that abates, the rebound to the highs is more likely than not. From here, there is more upside opportunity in the stock than downside risk. Even though it is still not cheap, it has already shed a lot of its top froth.Technically, when it fell into the $280 prior pivot zone, it found support. While this makes for a good base to build a rebound rally, it also marks a risk. If it's lost, then sellers could target $220, where there is an open gap from the earnings of last January. This is not a forecast, but a scenario that could be in play.So at the risk of not picking a perfect spot to enter, I don't take a full position all at once. After all, we still have the U.S. Fed's decision tomorrow and the China trade war headlines are still abuzz. There is plenty of issues to fret, but meanwhile there is still potential in quality companies with hampered stock prices.Click  here  for more of my market thesis and get an ongoing free copy of my weekly newsletters.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of  SellSpreads.com .

This delivered a divided Congress. Investors will now closely watch President Trump as he seeks to deal with a divided Congress over the rest of his current term.Markets have been reeling under pressure for quite some time and were closely awaiting the results of the midterm elections. Investors have been expecting that Trump's business-friendly policies would continue, while Democrats getting control over the House would help to provide a check on Trump's disruptive trade and market actions. The results lifted investor sentiment and helped in lifting a cloud of uncertainties weighing on markets.On Wednesday, the S&P 500's biggest boost came from tech, consumer discretionary and healthcare stocks. Investors are also expecting that Trump will be working closely with Democrats on his infrastructure plan. This saw a rally in industrial stocks. Tech stocks benefited on expectations that a split Congress will keep the President from acting against industry giants like Amazon, which have been responsible for the broader tech rally.Wednesday's rally, marked the biggest gains for both the Dow and the S&P 500 since the day after the 1982 midterm election results, when the indexes gained 4.3% and 3.9%, respectively. Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.

For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL - November 8, 2018 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include Disney DIS , Netflix NFLX , Amazon AMZN , Apple AAPL and AT&T T .Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Wednesday's Analyst Blog:Here's What to Expect from Disney's Q4 EarningsShares of Disney rose marginally during regular trading hours Wednesday just one day before the media powerhouse is set to report its Q4 financial results. So, let's take a look at everything investors should expect from Disney when it reports after the closing bell Thursday.Disney OverviewDisney's $71.3 billion deal to purchase 21st Century Fox's assets, which include Fox's film and TV studios, cleared one of its last significant regulatory hurdles Tuesday after European Union authorities approved the deal.The deal should help Disney fight Netflix, Amazon and most likely Apple and AT&T when the firm launches its stand-alone streaming platform in late 2019. Fox's film and TV studios will also strengthen the media conglomerate's box office performance, and even possibly Disney's theme park offerings. But these benefits aren't here yet.Q4 Revenue OutlookOur current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Disney's Q4 revenues to climb roughly 8.1% to reach $13.81 billion. More specifically, investors need to understand what to expect from Disney's individual business units as they could help determine how DIS stock trades in the near-term.Disney's Media Networks unit, which includes cable and broadcast, is projected to see its quarterly revenues climb 4% to $5.688 billion, based on our NFM estimates. We should note that Disney's largest division jumped 5% in Q3, but dipped 3% in the year-ago quarter.Meanwhile, the company's Park and Resorts revenues are expected to jump roughly 11.5% to reach $5.204 billion-unit revenues jumped 6% in both Q3 and the prior-year quarter. Disney's largest growth is expected to come from its Studio Entertainment unit, which is projected to soar 27.5% to reach $1.826 billion. It is, however, worth remembering that this is Disney's most volatile segment. Studio Entertainment revenues sunk 21% in Q4 of 2017 and surged 20% last quarter.EarningsNow that we have covered Disney's top-line expectations, it's time to see what we should expect from the other end of the income statement. Disney's adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to surge 22.43% to reach $1.31 per share. Still, we need to know if Disney is likely to top our quarterly earnings estimate. Luckily, we can turn to our exclusive Earnings ESP figure to do so.The Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter. The Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Disney is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that sports an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Unfortunately, this means that our model is inconclusive. With that said, Disney has fallen short of quarterly earnings estimates in four out of the last 10 periods, which includes a Q3 miss.Bottom LineInvestors should remember to pay close attention to any ESPN updates, including ESPN+ spending news. Maybe more importantly, any updates from CEO Bob Iger about Disney's streaming push, positive or negative, could drive the stock in either direction.Disney is set to report its fiscal 2018 and Q4 financial results after the closing bell Thursday.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

Demand for iPhone has been slowing for some time now. In its fiscal fourth quarter, iPhone sales barely grew from a year earlier.Understandably, the company now wants to project itself as more of a services business. That said, many market analysts believe that Apple's decision is in a move to hide the pain of slowing iPhone demand. This has also been taking a toll of Apple's shares. Also, the tech sector, particularly FAANG stocks, comprising Facebook, Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple and Netflix Inc., has been suffering lately, taking a toll on markets.Apple to Stop Reporting iPhone Sales NumberLast week, Apple on its earnings call announced that it would no longer report sales figures for iPhone, iPad, Mac and other hardware products in its quarterly reports. The announcement came alongside slowing iPhone unit sales. Apple said that in its fiscal fourth quarter, iPhone sales barely grew from the year-ago period, although the company launched a number of new devices.The company sold 46.89 million iPhones during the quarter ended Sep 30. Following this, Apple's shares slid 6.6% on Nov 2, marking its biggest single-day decline since January 2014. Naturally, Apple's decision has raised questions in the mind of analysts. Slowing demand for iPhone has been a growing concern for Apple and many analysts believe that by no longer reporting iPhone sales figures, the company wants to hide the pain of slowing demand for iPhone.Interestingly, Apple has time and again been praised for being one of the only tech companies to share sales numbers of its major products in each quarter. Apple this time said that reporting sales numbers in every quarter doesn't present an appropriate picture of Apple's performance.However, slowing demand for iPhone hasn't been hurting the company's profits, as it has been hiking prices of its products. Apple posted revenues of $62.90 billion for the quarter ended September 2018, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.29%. Also, Apple now wants to project itself as more of a services business. The company reported that revenues from services reached an all-time high of $10 billion, 17% higher than the year-ago period.Tech Sector Continues to SufferApple's shares have taken a beating lately, with the situation worsening after the company gave a weak guidance and warned that sales for the all-important holiday quarter could likely miss expectations. Moreover, the decision to not report iPhone sales has further raised questions in the minds of analysts and investors.However, tech stocks, particularly the FAANG group, have been one of the major drivers of the markets' long rally. However, despite being the third-best performer on the S&P 500 index, tech stocks have had a rough 2018. And one of the major reasons behind this roller-coaster ride has been growing fears of trade war. Apple, Google, Netflix, Facebook and Amazon each carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .Also, on Nov 5, Amazon's shares tumbled after President Donald Trump said that the administration was looking into the antitrust violations committed by the company. Moreover, renewed concerns over user data privacy and security after breaches and vulnerabilities by the likes of Facebook and Google are also affecting tech companies. Facebook has been punished by investors time and again since it got embroiled in a data misuse scandal involving Cambridge Analytica.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

 By Sruthi Shankar Nov 8 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq edged lower on Thursday, as weak earnings reports and caution ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision stalled a rally from the previous session, which was spurred by the outcome for midterm elections. Among the biggest deliners on the S&P 500 were Perrigo Co, Wynn Resorts Ltd  and D.R. Horton Inc, all falling on disappointing quarterly results. Technology stocks, that rallied the most on Wednesday, dipped 0.4 percent. The S&P banking index  was up 0.9 percent, with Bank of America Corp  rising 1.8 percent and JPMorgan Chase & Co  gaining 1 percent ahead of the Fed decision. Financials were among the few gainers, with the broader market dipping after a 2 percent surge on Wednesday as investors braced for a political gridlock in Washington. "The market is going to go into a trading range for a while...(yesterday) was relief that there wouldn't be any severe economic changes for the next couple of years," said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co in Sarasota, Florida. "The Fed may give some indication of what they're going to do in December, that might be holding the market back." The U.S. central bank, which is set to release its rate decision at 2:00 pm ET, is expected to leave interest rates unchanged, but the statement that follows could lay the ground for a fourth rate hike in December as well as next year. At 11:39 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was up 51.07 points, or 0.20 percent, at 26,231.37, the S&P 500  was down 2.56 points, or 0.09 percent, at 2,811.33 and the Nasdaq Composite  was down 25.53 points, or 0.34 percent, at 7,545.23. Gains in Walgreen Boots Alliance Inc  and Intel Corp  lifted the Dow. Wynn Resorts fell 12.1 percent after the casino operator missed third-quarter profit estimate and warned of a slowdown in the key Macau market. That hit shares of peers Melco Resorts  and MGM Resorts D.R. Horton  fell 6.2 percent and dragged on other homebuilders after it warned of rising home prices and higher mortgage rates weighing on demand.  The PHLX Housing index  fell 1.8 percent. Perrigo Co  plunged 14.9 percent after the generic drugmaker cut full-year earnings forecast on lowered expectations from its prescription pharmaceuticals.  The top gainer on the S&P 500 was TripAdvisor Inc, which jumped 15.6 percent after the hotel search website reported better-than-expected third-quarter profit.  Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.19-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.12-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 33 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 63 new highs and 58 new lows. 
 
 Rumors of   Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL) augmented reality (AR) glasses, supposedly   known internally at Apple as "T288," took off a little more than   a year ago when   Bloomberg reported    that the company was aiming for a 2019 debut of its AR glasses,   and a 2020 launch. Since then, others have offered up alternative   timelines for the company's AR glasses, and speculated that they   might include virtual reality technology as well.But what's been happening lately with Apple's AR glasses plan?   A little more light was shed on the subject back in August, when   news surfaced that Apple had bought an augmented reality lens   company, Akonia Holographics.  Image source: Getty Images.Apple's purchase of the company sparked a lot of interest,   because Akonia's focus had been on creating transparent AR   displays that offer a full range of color and high field-of-view.   That's important because current versions of AR headsets are   bulky and have tinted lenses, while Akonia's displays are   designed as thin, transparent lenses.Apple's true intentions, of course, are still unknown. But   since Akonia is working on hardware that could be paired nicely   with Apple's current AR software, the tech giant's snatching it   up throws a lot more fuel on the fire of speculation that an   Apple AR device may be on its way in the next few years.And it adds to Apple's already steady progression toward   augmented reality.Apple has been talking about AR for a little while now, the   latest being at its developer conference in June. Apple released   the second version of its augmented reality developer platform,   ARKit 2, which allows people to create augmented reality apps on   iOS. With the latest version, Apple added two new key features:   shared experiences and persistence.The "shared experiences" feature is precisely what it sounds   like: It allows two people using their own devices to play an AR   game together and interact with objects in the same space. The   other feature, persistence, will enable objects in games to stay   where a player places them. Apple says you can play an AR puzzle   game on a table and come back to it later, and the pieces will be   in the same place. These are two advanced AR features; they show   that Apple is spending substantial effort to make its new ARKit 2   more advanced.This matters because when Apple releases its augmented reality   glasses, possibly within two years, it will need to have a robust   AR platform already in place. The company knows that allowing   developers to create increasingly complex AR on its software   now    will allow them to more easily build useful apps for a new Apple   device later.To understand just how focused on AR Apple has become, listen   to these two quotes from the company's CEO, Tim Cook. The first   comes from   Cook's 2017 interview with Bloomberg    :I think it is profound. I am so excited about it, I just     want to yell out and scream. The first step in making it a     mainstream kind of experience is to put it in the operating     system. We're building it into iOS 11, opening it to developers     -- and unleashing the creativity of millions of people. Even we     can't predict what's going to come out.Cook has been good to his word about building AR into iOS and   opening it up even more to developers in ARKit 2. He believes   augmented reality could be as big as smartphones are to us now,   and   told   The Independent     :I regard it as a big idea like the smartphone. The     smartphone is for everyone, we don't have to think the iPhone     is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market:     it's for everyone. I think AR is that big, it's huge.  Image source: Apple.One of the most significant ways Apple could benefit from AR   is, unsurprisingly, by selling more iPhones. If the company   releases its glasses in the next couple of years, it's likely   that they'd rely heavily on an iPhone's processing power to do   most of the work, leaving the glasses smaller, cheaper, and with   Apple's characteristically sleek design.The glasses would serve two purposes. First, they would boost   iPhone upgrade cycles for people who don't see the need to   upgrade to a new phone every year (or even for several years).   Second, they could create new revenue in Apple's wearable   products segment.Gene Munster, a longtime Apple analyst and founder of Loup   Ventures, believes Apple will release its AR glasses at the end   of 2021. Munster thinks the devices will cost $1,300, and that   they could sell 10 million units in the first year; that would   add $13 billion to Apple's wearable business if the estimates pan   out.The main takeaways for Apple investors are that the company is   undoubtedly moving further into AR, and that it's unlikely all of   this attention is   only    for iOS and Apple's mobile devices. Though it's a great first   step, augmented reality is best experienced with a wearable   device; it would be odd for Apple to continually pour time and   resources into AR if it's only going to be used on the iPad and   iPhone.So it may be that Apple is indeed working toward its own AR   glasses.

 By Paul Sandle LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Xiaomi, the world's fourth ranked smartphone maker, entered Britain on Thursday with the international debut of its flagship Mi 8 Pro, which it hopes will win fans in a market dominated by Samsung  and Apple. Senior vice president Xiang Wang said Britain had a "cool" factor that aligned with the company's appeal to its customers. "It is a young energetic place, so pretty much fits to our culture - we want to be the coolest company in our fans' minds." Xiaomi, which listed in July and has a market value of about $44 billion, initially targeted other Asian markets for overseas expansion, notably India, where it toppled Samsung as the top smartphone seller earlier this year. The company, founded in 2010, made its European debut in Spain a year ago - where according to research firm Canalys it already ranks third - followed by France and Italy this year. It said in August that overseas revenue for the quarter ending June 30 had more than doubled year-on-year.  Xiaomi'sUK product line-up is led by the Mi 8 Pro, which has a dual camera powered by artificial intelligence, a 6.21 inch high-definition AMOLED display, a pressure-sensitive in-display fingerprint sensor and a transparent glass back cover. It is also bringing its entry-level Redmi 6A device, priced from 99 pounds ($130), Wang said, and some of the other products in the "Mi" range, including its Xiaomi Band 3 fitness band and an electric scooter. The company's products will be sold both online and in store, including at an authorised Mi outlet due to open in  London's Westfield mall on November 18. "Online we will do mi.com and we will work with every online channel including Amazon and others," Wang said. "Offline partners will include Carphone Warehouse   and the exclusive launch carrier channel will be 3."

 By Sruthi Shankar Nov 8 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged lower on Thursday, as a clutch of weak earnings reports punctured a rally from the previous session, which was spurred by the outcome for midterm elections. Wynn Resorts Ltd, Perrigo Co  and D.R. Horton Inc  were the biggest losers on the S&P 500, all falling after reporting disappointing quarterly results. Stocks had gained more than 2 percent on Wednesday after Americans voted for a divided Congress, which was largely anticipated by investors who raised bets that it would be positive for stocks. While it could make it harder for President Donald Trump to push through new legislations such as additional tax cuts, investors are hoping for compromise on policies such as increasing infrastructure spending. Despite the dip in markets on Thursday, traders said investors were largely positive about the election outcome. "The general sentiment is I should be buying into a split Congress because it probably means nothing will happen out of Washington," said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. The Fed, which is set to release its rate decision at 2:00 pm ET, is expected to leave interest rates unchanged, but the statement that follows could lay the ground for a fourth rate hike in December and for the next year. A steep selloff in October has taken the S&P 500  down about 4 percent from its record high, with investors worried that the U.S. economy could gather more steam and encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates further. However, some of those worries were put to rest by Wednesday's election results, which reduced the odds of further corporate tax cuts by the Trump administration.

Perrigo Co  dropped 10.7 percent after the generic drugmaker cut full-year earnings forecast on lowered expectations from its prescription pharmaceuticals.

 DUBLIN, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Facebook  has taken on a long-term lease in Dublin which will quadruple the floor space at its international headquarters and allow the company to more than double its current staff of over 4,000. Facebook said on Thursday the expansion would provide enough space for another 5,000 employees. Such an increase would make the U.S. company one of the largest multinational employers in Ireland next to the likes of Google  and Apple, which each employ over 6,000 people around the country. The social media company runs a number of global and regional teams across three office buildings in Dublin where it employs engineers, legal professionals, marketing and sales staff. "This significant investment in a 14-acre campus with capacity for thousands more employees demonstrates our commitment to Ireland, our desire to grow our business here and continue to contribute to the economy." Irish Business Minister Heather Humphreys said the expansion represented a huge vote of confidence in Ireland, which aided by low corporate tax rates, counts foreign mulinationals like Facebook for around one-in-ten jobs in the fast-growing economy. By acquiring the lease, Facebook is taking over the headquarters of Allied Irish Banks, which said previously it was moving from its offices near Dublin's technology quarter. 
 
3 Top Large-Cap Stocks to Buy Right Now
 Individual investors were jolted by the sudden reappearance of   market volatility in October. Given a range of issues spanning   natural gas availability heading into winter, oil sanctions on   Iran, and an escalating trade war with China, it's possible that   increased volatility is here to stay -- in the short term, at   least.That may make it worthwhile to begin looking at large-cap   companies with mature businesses, which can provide stability   during turbulent market periods. We asked three contributors here   at The Motley Fool for the best such stocks to buy right now.   Here's why they chose   NextEra Energy    (NYSE: NEE) ,   Kohl's Corporation    (NYSE: KSS) , and   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) .  Image source: Getty Images.  Maxx Chatsko    (NextEra Energy):    Many stocks coughed up a significant chunk of market cap in   October, sending the   S&P 500    lower by 6.9% as a result. That makes NextEra Energy stock's 2.9%   gain all the more impressive. Why did investors run to the $80   billion utility for cover?Well, it didn't report third-quarter 2018 earnings until the   final week of October, but I think the numbers validate the idea   that NextEra Energy is as solid of a business as they come. It's   not really a secret at this point, as evidenced by the stock's   thumping of the S&P 500 in the last two decades.Nonetheless, the utility reported year-over-year growth in   adjusted earnings per share of 18% for the third quarter and 14%   for the first nine months of the year. It reached its full-year   2018 target for return on equity at Florida Power & Light   while deploying 13% more capital (an indicator of future rate   increase allowances) during the most recent quarter compared with   the year-ago period. It completed the acquisition of Florida City   Gas, which will provide an important growth opportunity in   natural gas utility infrastructure. And its power generation   business added over 1,400 megawatts of wind, solar, and storage   power capacity to the backlog -- getting it closer to its goal of   a backlog stuffed with 40,000 megawatts of renewable power   projects by 2020.It's a bit unfair, but having a larger capital base allows a   utility to invest more into its business, thus increasing its   capital base, and the cycle continues. As the largest publicly   traded utility, NextEra Energy is taking full advantage of its   size. It expects to grow adjusted EPS from $6.70 in 2017 to over   $9.40 in 2021, while   growing the dividend    at around 13% per year through at least 2020. That provides a   powerful argument for owning this large-cap stock as a hedge   against market volatility -- and for building long-term   wealth.  Image source: Getty Images.  Todd Campbell    (Kohl's Corp.):    The all-important holiday shopping season is almost upon us, and   this year owning Kohl's could pay off even more handsomely than   usual because of the Toys R Us bankruptcy, the looming   Sears     bankruptcy, strong employment and wage growth, a   collaboration with e-commerce Goliath   Amazon.com    , and a bigger focus on electronics.Kohl's is featuring   Microsoft    's Xbox One S on Black Friday, and it has expanded its assortment   of Nest and Google brand products from   Alphabet     to attract techies. And to increase foot traffic in January   and February, it recently   expanded     a pilot program that allows consumers to return Amazon.com   purchases free of charge at more than 100 Kohl's stores near Los   Angeles, Chicago, and Milwaukee.Those moves could help Kohl's attract new shoppers, but it   could benefit even more if shoppers shun Sears because of   bankruptcy concerns. Kohl's generates most of its total   revenue from apparel and home products, and apparel and   soft-home, like bedding, accounted for about $4.3 billion of   Sears sales last year, or roughly 32% of Sears total merchandise   revenue. If apparel and home foot traffic shifts from Sears to   Kohl's, it could be margin-friendly because profit-friendly   private-label brands and exclusive brands, including Simply Vera   Vera Wang, account for 42% of Kohl's sales.The Toys R Us bankruptcy could similarly boost foot traffic   and sales because it's given Kohl's an opportunity to add new   brands this year, including LEGO.Overall, the National Retail Federation estimates average   consumer spending this holiday season will increase 4.1% because   of wage growth, and since November and December account for about   30% of Kohl's annual sales, it should be able to capture its fair   share of this additional revenue, making this a good time to   buy its shares.

Over the last five years,   revenue has grown by 53%, net income is up 61%, and hundreds of   billions of dollars have been generated in free cash flow.     AAPL Revenue (TTM)    data by   YCharts    .What's amazing about this growth is that iPhone volumes have   been flat for most of the past five years. Instead of growing   units sold, Apple has   managed to squeeze more out of each customer    . For example, it did that in the most recent quarter by   increasing the average sale price of an iPhone from $618 a year   ago to $793. High-end features like Face ID and storage   limitations on low-end devices have pushed consumers to more   expensive phones -- and they're still buying in droves.Accessories also play a key role in Apple's ecosystem and   growth. The Apple Watch is essentially an accessory of the iPhone   and it's now the best-selling watch in the world. AirPods are   another extension of the Apple ecosystem that make life just a   little easier and increase the overall spend per iPhone user. Add   in cloud services, app store purchases, and music subscriptions   and Apple has a growing revenue base and is locking customers   into the ecosystem along the way.It's the lock-in that makes Apple so valuable long term. Like   it or not, customers are loyal to Apple and keep coming back for   updated phones, watches, computers, tablets, and more. That will   continue to drive growth, and with pricing power growing, the   growth days at Apple are far from over.  10 stocks we like better than NextEra Energy       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

 Shares of Netflix NFLX  surged 5.36% during regular trading hours Wednesday amid its struggle to regain momentum. So, let's see what had Netflix investors so excited to help decide if now might be time to buy Netflix stock on the dip. Recent News Buckingham Research on Monday raised its Netflix rating from "underperform" to "buy." The firm gave the streaming giant a double upgrade on the back of its discount and its position as a top internet TV platform. "We have always viewed Netflix as the continued top streaming category winner," analyst Matthew Harrigan wrote Monday  .Buckingham also upped its Netflix price target from $349 per share to $406 per share. It is worth noting that the firm pointed to Netflix's 27% decline from its summer highs as the "primary upgrade catalyst."On top Buckingham's buy on the dip-based upgrade, Netflix announced Tuesday a new lineup of animated programming. The company said it would roll out six, all-new projects animated projects, including movies and original series. Netflix noted that nearly 60% of its members watch kids and family content every month.      Overview There has been little Netflix news over the last few days aside from Buckingham's upgrade and its new slate of animated offerings. Therefore, it seems that investors might be thinking seriously about the idea of buying Netflix stock on the dip.Netflix stock had soared until its now infamous Q2 subscriber miss, with its shares still down nearly 23% from its 52-week high of $423.21 per share as of Wednesday. Yet, Netflix added a total of 7 million subscribers during the third quarter. This blew away its own subscriber growth projections by roughly 2 million and set a new Q3 record.The streaming firm ended the quarter with 137.1 million subscribers worldwide, up roughly 25% from the year-ago period's 109.25 million. And Netflix doesn't expect this growth to end. The company projected that it will add 7.6 million paid users and 9.4 million total subscribers in Q4.     Outlook Netflix ended HBO's 17-year streak  at the top of the Emmy nomination list this year, only five years after it started producing original content. Going forward, hit shows will prove key to Netflix's ability to attract and maintain subscribers. This will become even more paramount with Apple AAPL  , Disney DIS  , and AT&T T  all set to release their own streaming platforms.Plus, Amazon AMZN  continues to push further into streaming video. Luckily, Netflix has amassed a slew of original content offerings and have started to offer more movies with A-list Hollywood stars, which includes Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Chris Pine, to name a few.  Looking ahead, our current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Netflix's Q4 revenues to climb 27.97% to reach $4.20 billion. Meanwhile, the company's fiscal 2018 revenues are projected to reach $15.84 billion, which would mark a 35.49% surge.At the bottom end of the income statement, Netflix is expected to see its Q4 earnings sink 41%. However, the firm's adjusted full-year earnings are expected to skyrocket 108% to reach $2.61 per share. Bottom Line Netflix has seen its Q4 earnings revision picture turn very negative over the last 30 days. Yet, its fiscal 2018 and 2019 earnings revision activity has been more mixed, which helps Netflix earn a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Therefore, now might not be the best time to buy Netflix stock. But shares of NFLX do still rest well below their 52-week highs. Plus, the company looks poised to add more and more subscribers in a streaming TV industry that is only going to grow.

Each of the   more than 217 million iPhones    that the company sold during its fiscal year 2018 incorporated a   sizable chunk of both DRAM -- which is a type of computer memory   that's used as primary system memory -- and NAND flash -- which   is used for storage in smartphones, PCs, and data center   servers.Apple uses both DRAM and NAND in its other computing product   lines, too, including the iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple   TV.  Image source: Apple.Because Apple uses memory chips so extensively across numerous   product lines, the company's   gross margin    -- and, ultimately, its overall profitability -- depends somewhat   on market conditions for both types of memory. When memory prices   are high, Apple's gross margin could suffer; when they decline,   its gross margin can benefit.During Apple's most recent earnings call, analyst Katy Huberty   asked Apple CFO Luca Maestri: "... [A]s a follow-up,   NAND prices fell significantly during the   September quarter    . Why aren't we seeing that flow through to margin expansion for   the overall company?"Let's take a look at what Maestri had to say.Maestri began by saying that Apple will "be getting some   benefits from commodities in general and memory in particular,"   adding that "memory on a sequential basis [is] about 30 basis   points favorable for us, going into the December quarter."Put another way, if everything else were held constant,   Apple's gross margin -- which was 38.3% last quarter -- would be   set to rise to 38.6% in the current quarter. That might not seem   like a large jump, but consider that Apple guided to revenue of   between $89 billion and $93 billion for the coming quarter. At   the midpoint of that range -- $91 billion -- that memory-related   improvement in gross margin would be worth about $273 million in   pretax profit -- which is a   lot    of money.Apple's guidance for the current quarter calls for gross   margin to be between 38% and 38.5% -- below what that figure   would be with the memory tailwind and all else being equal.   Clearly, Apple is facing some gross margin headwinds   elsewhere.Maestri provided investors with some insight into why Apple's   gross margin guidance for the current quarter isn't better.On the positive side, Maestri explained that in addition to   the memory tailwind, the company will "be benefiting from the   leverage, which is typical of our seasonality in the December   quarter." This simply means that because the company will ship   significantly more product compared to the prior quarter, it can   spread its fixed production costs across a larger sales base,   improving gross margin.Maestri said, however, that "currencies have weakened against   the U.S. dollar, and the impact we expect at the gross margin   level from foreign exchange is a 90   basis point    headwind sequentially."So, foreign exchange movements more than offset the good news   on the commodity side of things.That's not all, though. Maestri also said that the company has   "higher cost structures because, as I said, we've launched so   many new products in the last six weeks."As a reminder, back on Apple's   earnings call in May    , Maestri explained that "typically when we launch a new product,   that product tends to have a higher cost structure than the   product it replaces." On the bright side, Maestri explained at   the time that although "that is something we need to work through   every time we launch a new product ... we have a pretty good   track record and history of taking those cost structures down   over time."

Shares of Disney DIS rose marginally during regular trading hours Wednesday just one day before the media powerhouse is set to report its Q4 financial results. So, let's take a look at everything investors should expect from Disney when it reports after the closing bell Thursday.Disney OverviewDisney's $71.3 billion deal to purchase major 21st Century Fox FOXA assets, which include Fox's film and TV studios, cleared one of its last significant regulatory hurdles Tuesday after European Union authorities approved the deal.The deal should help Disney fight Netflix NFLX , Amazon AMZN , and most likely Apple AAPL and AT&T T when the firm launches its stand-alone streaming platform in late 2019. Fox's film and TV studios will also strengthen the media conglomerate's box office performance, and even possibly Disney's theme park offerings. But these benefits aren't here yet.Q4 Revenue OutlookOur current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Disney's Q4 revenues to climb roughly 8.1% to reach $13.81 billion. More specifically, investors need to understand what to expect from Disney's individual business units as they could help determine how DIS stock trades in the near-term.Disney's Media Networks unit, which includes cable and broadcast, is projected to see its quarterly revenues climb 4% to $5.688 billion, based on our NFM estimates. We should note that Disney's largest division jumped 5% in Q3, but dipped 3% in the year-ago quarter.Meanwhile, the company's Park and Resorts revenues are expected to jump roughly 11.5% to reach $5.204 billion-unit revenues jumped 6% in both Q3 and the prior-year quarter. Disney's largest growth is expected to come from its Studio Entertainment unit, which is projected to soar 27.5% to reach $1.826 billion. It is, however, worth remembering that this is Disney's most volatile segment. Studio Entertainment revenues sunk 21% in Q4 of 2017 and surged 20% last quarter.EarningsNow that we have covered Disney's top-line expectations, it's time to see what we should expect from the other end of the income statement. Disney's adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to surge 22.43% to reach $1.31 per share. Still, we need to know if Disney is likely to top our quarterly earnings estimate. Luckily, we can turn to our exclusive Earnings ESP figure to do so.The Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter. The Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Disney is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that sports an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Unfortunately, this means that our model is inconclusive. With that said, Disney has fallen short of quarterly earnings estimates in four out of the last 10 periods, which includes a Q3 miss.Bottom LineInvestors should remember to pay close attention to any ESPN updates, including ESPN+ spending news. Maybe more importantly, any updates from CEO Bob Iger about Disney's streaming push, positive or negative, could drive the stock in either direction.Disney is set to report its fiscal 2018 and Q4 financial results after the closing bell Thursday.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.
 With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.

10 Strong Buy Stocks Trading at Killer Entry Points
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNow isn't the time to panic. Now is the time to sort the strong buy stocks from the crowd. It's time to be active but selective when choosing stocks to buy. With the market so choppy right now all ten of these stocks are trading at extremely compelling levels. The selloff has unlocked value and created some great buying opportunities. Some of these stocks have reported mixed earnings results, but the bullish long-term picture is nonetheless firmly intact. Indeed, as you will see below analysts are also calling these specific stocks cheap right now.Here I use TipRanks market data to be a bit more precise. In other words, I can see the exact upside potential analysts are modelling for from current share price levels. That gives us a much clearer idea of the kind of growth outlook we can expect. Are you ready? Some of these stocks are poised for serious growth…Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) shares plunged at the end of last week after the tech giant's fiscal Q4 earnings report. This was despite Apple beating out the Street's predictions by 20% with revenue of $62.9 billion and EPS of $2.91.So what spooked investors? AAPL's guidance of $91 billion for the holiday season fell short of expectations. Meanwhile Apple announced it will no longer release unit sales figures for iPhones, iPads and Macs. One analyst called this a "jaw dropper," as "Apple is at the critical juncture where higher ASPs [average selling prices] are making up for slower unit sales, which remains the worry."Two subsequent ratings downgrades caused a further blow to share prices.However, top-ranked Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives ( Track Record & Ratings ) is bullish. He has reiterated his Buy rating with a Street-high price target of $310. From current levels this indicates lucrative upside potential of over 53%."Our core bull thesis does not change on the story and to some extent is emboldened by the ~$800 ASP story and a robust services business poised to hit $50 billion+ in FY20."Ives points to Apple Services as a game-changer for the stock. Apple now has an active installed base of 1.3 billion devices to monetize."We caution investors not to lose sight of the massive metamorphosis on the horizon at Apple being led by the services business," Ives wrote. "We continue to encourage investors to see the forest through the trees on this name and view last week as the first step in the ultimate re-rating of the stock higher over the coming years." Interested in AAPL stock?  Get a free AAPL Stock Research Report.It's time to play fetch, says Cantor Fitzgerald's Brandon Folkes ( Track Record & Ratings ). Pet biotech stock Kindred Biosciences Inc (NASDAQ: KIN ) has just released positive pilot data for the company's first antibody product, KIND-016, for atopic dermatitis in dogs.For Folkes the data "validates KIN's ability to develop a portfolio of companion animal antibody products that target large market opportunities with differentiated or superior products."He raised his price target from $20 to $25 as "KIN has multiple antibody product candidates in development that could represent $100MM+ opportunities each." The stock is currently at just $14.20.Plus a word of reassurance about a crowded market: the market has sufficient capacity to support multiple blockbuster products, including KIND-016.Bottom line: "We believe KIN's pipeline of novel animal health drugs will drive long-term shareholder value, and we expect upward earnings revisions, multiple expansion, and pipeline advancements to drive the stock higher."  Get the KIN Stock Research Report.It's worth taking a look on the bigger picture when it comes to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA ) stock.And analysts are unanimously optimistic on China's e-commerce giant - especially when it comes to the long term.Okay, so the company reported mixed Q2 results. Alibaba's Q2 ESP of 9.60 yuan ($1.40) came in well above the 7.43 yuan expected by the Street. But BABA also cut its full-year sales forecast by 4-6% due to concerns over the economic impact of a U.S.-China trade spat.These macro issues have brought shares down 16% year-over-year. However, this just makes the upside opportunity even stronger. On average top, analysts are modelling for 50% upside potential.RBC Capital's Mark Mahaney ( Track Record & Ratings ) wrote: "If the Macros do not worsen further (yes, a big IF), we view BABA's Risk/Reward as very compelling here. Why? Core China Commerce Comps likely ease through the second half of the year and into next."He calls strategic investments in Ele.me, Lazada, New Retail and Cainiao "the right ones" while BABA's consistent, robust growth rates are indicative of the platform's strength and scale. Finally, Cloud continues to demonstrate hyper-growth (+90% Y/Y).  Get the BABA Stock Research Report.Aluminum stock Alcoa Corp (NYSE: AA ) is just too cheap to ignore, says Credit Suisse's Curt Woodworth ( Track Record & Ratings ). He made the call on the back of stellar Q3 results. Encouragingly, AA also announced a $200M buyback program.This is a stock that is now 'significantly undervalued' writes Woodworth. He sees Q3's strong operating performance and tightness in alumina supply sparking meaningful earnings revisions across the Street.Even more bullish is JP Morgan's Michael Gambardella. Following the Q3 results he bumped his price target up to $79 from $75 previously. That means he now sees shares exploding 116%! Gambardella's take is that right now shares are "discounting too steep of a drop in alumina and aluminum prices."Like Alibaba, Alcoa scores a full house of Buy ratings from the Street. Meanwhile the average analyst price target of $60 suggests upside potential of over 65%.  Get the AA Stock Research Report.Drinks giant Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE: STZ ) has just reported a 'beautiful quarter.' Powerful growth resulted in EPS soaring 15.6% from Q2 with sales up over 10%."The core business is growing faster than anyone believed, and the Canopy Growth investment is very likely a masterstroke," gushes Pivotal Research's Timothy Ramey ( Track Record & Ratings ).The company has just announced a massive $4 billion investment in Canada's Canopy Growth for a 38% stake (up from 9.9% previously) - our "exclusive global cannabis partner," according to Constellation Brands CEO Rob Sands."We are convinced that CGC is the best way to play the rapidly growing Cannabis market and investors should begin to fully reflect that value and CGC's prospects, rather than penalizing STZ for the cash carrying costs of the investment" argues Ramey.Plus, Constellation trades at 22x our estimate of FY20 EPS and 17.3x FY18 EV/EBITDA - no doubt as cheap as STZ has been in the past five years. If we look at Ramey's $300 price target, this  suggests 50% upside from current levels! Full steam ahead I say.  Get the STZ Stock Research Report.Contrary to Street expectations, mega stock Amazon.com  (NASDAQ: AMZN ) failed to impress with its recent 3Q18 revenue results. Meanwhile AMZN guided for Q4 operating margin of $2.10-$3.60B (4.1% margin at the midpoint). This was below the Street's $3.86B forecast (5.2% margin).But don't be put off. Instead consider this an early holiday discount. Stifel Nicolaus' Scott Devitt ( Track Record & Ratings ) stuck to his Buy rating post-earnings with a $2,400 price target. From current levels, this indicates 44% upside potential."Weaker than expected guidance may caution some, though we note results remain strong on an absolute basis and maintain our positive view given Amazon's leading position in the Cloud services and retail sectors and the growing margin opportunity as the revenue mix shifts towards the higher margin AWS and advertising businesses" states the Stifel analyst.Plus from a longer-term perspective, AMZN still stands out from the crowd. "Amazon, in our view, remains one of the best longer-term values in Tech and we still see a path to where the shares could double over the next three years," says Aegis' Victor Anthony.These analysts enjoy a clear majority when it comes to AMZN stock. With 36 recent Buy ratings, only 1 analyst (KeyBanc's Edward Yruma) is still on the sidelines.  Get the AMZN Stock Research Report.HC Wainwright's Andrew Fein ( Track Record & Ratings ) has been forced to reanalyze his take on biotech stock Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: VRTX ). And if this isn't a stock on your Buy list, I suggest you reanalyze too!"We have recently returned from the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference, and in conversations with physicians, nurses and CF care-givers we were astounded by the positive reaction the cystic fibrosis community has towards the Vertex triples" Fein writes.As a result, he upgraded the stock from Hold to Buy. The analyst continues: "We have not seen this level of optimism and heard so many anecdotal experiences since the early days of Kalydeco in G551D patients."With this heightened likelihood of success in mind, Fein takes the stock to a bullish $220 price target (27% upside potential). Taken together, these triple regimen assumptions yield POS [probability of success] adjusted worldwide revenues of $529M in 2020 - and get this - could grow to $7.3B by 2024.Overall this 'Strong Buy' stock scores 10 recent Buy ratings vs just 1 hold rating.  Get the VRTX Stock Research Report.Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE: COF ) is a bank holding company specializing in credit cards, auto loans, banking and savings products. "We see favorable credit, modest loan growth, and thoughtful expense management to support our positive fundamental outlook - shares meanwhile are very modestly valued at 7.8x 2019E," opines RBC Capital's Jason Arnold ( Track Record & Ratings ).He made the comments following a resounding Q3 earnings beat. COF reported GAAP EPS of $2.99 vs. the firm's $2.77 estimate. Encouragingly, improved credit performance and favorable outlook suggest "growth math" continues, and that credit losses should remain more stable. Arnold now has a $123 price target up from $121 previously, which means he sees 41% upside potential.In total, COF has received 8 recent Buy ratings with 1 Hold rating.  Get the COF Stock Research Report.If you are looking for a bit of a leap of faith, then this could be the stock for you. Newell Brands Inc (NYSE: NWL ) is a worldwide marketer of consumer and commercial products with a portfolio of brands including Rubbermaid food storage, home organization and reusable container products.Now to the facts: Newell Brands is down -25% over the last month vs. the S&P 500 which is down -6%. Plus the stock's analyst consensus is Hold. So that's not great. But one top analyst believes that we are looking at a strong buying opportunity, and her points hold sway:"We think the recent sharp selloff in NWL shares is way overdone and would be aggressive buyers at these levels" writes Wells Fargo's Bonnie Herzog ( Track Record & Ratings ). She sees shares soaring a whopping 80% to $36.Herzog believes the underperformance is down to a large shareholder unwinding their position (which could be close to being finished) as well as several concerns including: no news on asset sales, high leverage and exposure to China."We've talked to many investors over the past few weeks and while there is a lot of interest in the stock, few investors are willing to buy the weakness, with many suggesting they believe in the long-term opportunity but would rather wait and buy the stock on an up-swing."Net-net, that presents a great buy opportunity - with significant upside to shares even in Herzog's worst-case scenario.  Get the NWL Stock Research Report.
 >This semiconductor stock has just held an upbeat analyst day - sparking 13 Buy ratings from the Street. This includes an all-important upgrade from BMO's Ambrish Srivastava ( Track Record & Ratings ). Here's why he is moving to the bull camp on Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (NASDAQ: MRVL )."We have stayed on the sidelines long enough. We like the valuation, we find the risk/reward attractive ($6 upside/$2 downside), find estimates reasonable, especially after Marvell cleared the deck on the Cavium estimates, and management has built a track record of executing," cheered Srivastava. He thus raised his rating on shares to Outperform with a $24 target price (36% upside from current levels).At the analyst event, management singled out 5G as MRVL's largest growth/upside driver going forward, while announcing a $1 billion share buyback authorization (up from $300M previously).  Get the MRVL Stock Research Report.TipRanks.com offers exclusive insights for investors by focusing on the moves of experts: Analysts, Insiders, Bloggers, Hedge Fund Managers and more.

  Skyworks Solutions    (NASDAQ: SWKS) has been sucked into the whirlpool of the broader   semiconductor-industry weakness. Shares of the chipmaker are   now trading close to their 52-week lows, having underperformed   the market for the majority of the year.But the pessimism could go away once Skyworks   releases its fiscal fourth-quarter results on Nov. 8.   Skyworks has solid short- and long-term catalysts that could   boost investor sentiment, and it wouldn't be a surprise if the   company went on a sustained bull run from there. Let's see   why.  Image source: Getty Images. Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been   a big contributor    to Skyworks' sales growth over the years, but Cupertino's focus   on boosting the average selling prices of its iPhone line-up   while unit sales growth flattens has hurt the chipmaker's top   line. That's because Skyworks still gets between 35% and 40%   of its revenue from Apple, and a drop in the number of iPhone   units manufactured is certainly not good news for the   company.But the status quo could change as Skyworks has gained a lot   of space in the new iPhones. For instance, the flagship iPhone XS   Max contains a total of   eight Skyworks chips    . according to a teardown of the device. By comparison, last   year's flagship iPhone X had five Skyworks chips, according   to a teardown of the device by iFixit.The iPhone XS reportedly contains five of Skyworks'   chips. While there's no news about the iPhone XR yet, I expect   Skyworks to retain its power amplifier modules and RF switches in   the device as it had scored those spots in the iPhone 8   models last year.It certainly appears that the chipmaker is strongly placed   across Apple's entire iPhone ecosystem, which paves the way for   Skyworks to tap into a potential iPhone upgrade cycle. A recent   survey suggests that nearly half of Apple's U.S. customers   are planning to upgrade to a new iPhone over the next year. By   comparison, just 25% of the surveyed consumers had expressed a   willingness to upgrade in June 2017.A big upgrade cycle would help the company clock stronger   growth than what Wall Street currently anticipates. The   chipmaker's top line is expected to jump just 1.8% year over   year during the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended in September,   followed by a slower increase of just 1.6% during the following   quarter.That's a far cry from the solid growth that Skyworks enjoyed   last year, when its revenue for the quarter ended in September   shot up 18% annually, while revenue for the quarter ended in   December was up 15%. There's a solid chance that the chipmaker   will trump the market's expectations this time thanks to a   stronger relationship with Apple, though this isn't the only   catalyst the company enjoys.Skyworks has been gradually boosting its presence in the   Internet of Things    (IoT) space. It now gets around 30% of it revenue from   non-mobile sources thanks to its partnerships with   Sierra Wireless    ,   BMW    ,   General Motors    , and   Cisco    , among others. These customers are working on different IoT   niches, from connected cars to smart homes, putting Skyworks in a   strong position to   mint big money from this tech trend    .For instance, Skyworks' wireless chips are being used by   Philips    for powering its connected street lamps. There's a good chance   that Skyworks' IoT business will clock another period of strong   growth in fiscal Q4.But the more important thing to note here is that IoT is not   just a quarterly catalyst for Skyworks.   Ericsson    estimates that there will be 18 billion IoT devices online   by 2022, up from fewer than 6 billion just two years ago. This   would create the need for more of the connectivity chips that   Skyworks sells.In all, the upcoming quarterly report could spark a turnaround   and help Skyworks come out of the rut that it has been in so far   this year. Buying Skyworks Solutions now would be a good idea as   the stock is currently cheap, with a trailing   price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio    of 17. This is lower than the industry average P/E   ratio of about 22.  10 stocks we like better than Skyworks     Solutions       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLeading the Apple  (NASDAQ: AAPL ) rumor mill today is news of lawsuit plans with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ). Today, we'll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Wednesday. Qualcomm Lawsuit : It doesn't look like Apple has any planning to settle a lawsuit with Qualcomm , reports Reuters . According to a source close to the matter, the tech company doesn't have any plans to agree to a settlement with Qualcomm. Instead, this person notes that AAPL is actively preparing for a legal battle with QCOM. The tech company previously used Qualcomm modems in its smartphones, but legal battles between the two put an end to that. Those fights are still going on and this newest news is a part of it.LG OLED : A recent report claims that LG is starting mass production of OLED panels for Apple , AppleInsider notes. This report claims that LG is entering production for 400,000 OLED panels that will go to AAPL. The first delivery of these panels will take place in December. It's unknown what size the panels are or what devices they will be for.iOS 12.1 : A new version of  iOS 12.1 is now available to download , reports MacRumors.

The differences between these two version are unknown, but most likely have to do with minor bug fixes.The post Wednesday Apple Rumors: Apple Not Planning to Settle Qualcomm Lawsuit appeared first on InvestorPlace .
 By Stephen Nellis and Sonam Rai Nov 7 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc  forecast sales revenue for the holiday shopping quarter below analysts' estimates on Wednesday as it took a hit from the loss of chip sales to Apple Inc, sending its shares down 3.4 percent. The San Diego chipmaker also forecast its fiscal 2019 first-quarter profit above analysts' estimates, but the better-than-expected outlook was largely due to a one-time tax benefit of about 45 cents per share. It has also faced repeated challenges to a patent licensing model where it takes a cut of the selling price of a mobile phone, both from antitrust regulators and from customers including Apple, which is suing Qualcomm over its practices. The iPhone maker has excluded Qualcomm from its new iPhones XS and XS Max and XR that launched in September, instead choosing modem chips from rival Intel Corp. Earlier this summer, Qualcomm warned its shareholders that Apple would likely make that move, but the impact has shown up more swiftly than Wall Street expected. For Qualcomm's fiscal first quarter that ends in December, the chip firm forecast revenue of between $4.5 billion and $5.3 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.05 to $1.15 per share. Analysts were expecting revenue of $5.57 billion and earnings of 95 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Qualcomm Chief Financial Officer George Davis told Reuters that about half of Apple's chip purchases tended to come during the holiday quarter. Davis said Wall Street analysts may have expected the blow from the Apple loss to be more spread out over the year. "Our guidance has a reduction of over 50 million (chip) units in the quarter, all of that explained by the absence of being in Apple phones," Davis told Reuters. "That's really the difference." On the profit side, Davis said the adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.05 to $1.15 included a 45-cent-per-share benefit from a tax restructuring that would not repeat. "Net-net, it's not a disaster," said analyst Kinngai Chan from Summit Insights Group. "I think Qualcomm can build from here on out with 5G and growth in its adjacent businesses" such as chips for automobiles, Chan said. Earlier on Wednesday, Reuters reported that Apple is not in talks "at any level" to settle the litigation with Qualcomm, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Davis said there was "a lot of focus both internally and externally" on resolving the dispute with licensees, which include Apple, but did not comment on whether the two were in talks about a settlement. Qualcomm has tried to offset some of the woes related to Apple and the lawsuits by signing more deals with customers that effectively let them pay lower patent licensing rates. It has also reached new deals with large customers like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Also offsetting the Apple impact is a slew of new partnerships between Qualcomm and Chinese mobile phone makers including Xiaomi Corp, Oppo, Vivo and OnePlus, all of which offer lower-cost models in emerging markets like India.  Davis said those Chinese phone makers are increasingly making higher-priced devices that use Qualcomm's 700- and 800-series Snapdragon chips, which helped improve sales. "Even though we made some changes to the licensing program that allowed customers to effectively have a lower rate, that came back to us in the form of higher (chip) unit sales," Davis said.

 By Stephen Nellis and Sonam Rai Nov 7 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc  forecast sales revenue for the holiday shopping quarter below analysts' estimates on Wednesday as it took a hit from the loss of chip sales to Apple Inc, sending its shares down 3.4 percent. The San Diego chipmaker also forecast its fiscal 2019 first-quarter profit above analysts' estimates, but the better-than-expected outlook was largely due to a one-time tax benefit of about 45 cents per share. It has also faced repeated challenges to a patent licensing model where it takes a cut of the selling price of a mobile phone, both from antitrust regulators and from customers including Apple, which is suing Qualcomm over its practices. The iPhone maker has excluded Qualcomm from its new iPhones XS and XS Max and XR that launched in September, instead choosing modem chips from rival Intel Corp. Earlier this summer, Qualcomm warned its shareholders that Apple would likely make that move, but the impact has shown up more swiftly than Wall Street expected. For Qualcomm's fiscal first quarter that ends in December, the chip firm forecast revenue of between $4.5 billion and $5.3 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.05 to $1.15 per share. Analysts were expecting revenue of $5.57 billion and earnings of 95 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Qualcomm Chief Financial Officer George Davis told Reuters that about half of Apple's chip purchases tended to come during the holiday quarter. Davis said Wall Street analysts may have expected the blow from the Apple loss to be more spread out over the year. "Our guidance has a reduction of over 50 million (chip) units in the quarter, all of that explained by the absence of being in Apple phones," Davis told Reuters. "That's really the difference." On the profit side, Davis said the adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.05 to $1.15 included a 45-cent-per-share benefit from a tax restructuring that would not repeat. "Net-net, it's not a disaster," said analyst Kinngai Chan from Summit Insights Group. "I think Qualcomm can build from here on out with 5G and growth in its adjacent businesses" such as chips for automobiles, Chan said. Earlier on Wednesday, Reuters reported that Apple is not in talks "at any level" to settle the litigation with Qualcomm, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Davis said there was "a lot of focus both internally and externally" on resolving the dispute with licensees, which include Apple, but did not comment on whether the two were in talks about a settlement. Qualcomm has tried to offset some of the woes related to Apple and the lawsuits by signing more deals with customers that effectively let them pay lower patent licensing rates. It has also reached new deals with large customers like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Also offsetting the Apple impact is a slew of new partnerships between Qualcomm and Chinese mobile phone makers including Xiaomi Corp, Oppo, Vivo and OnePlus, all of which offer lower-cost models in emerging markets like India.  Davis said those Chinese phone makers are increasingly making higher-priced devices that use Qualcomm's 700- and 800-series Snapdragon chips, which helped improve sales. "Even though we made some changes to the licensing program that allowed customers to effectively have a lower rate, that came back to us in the form of higher (chip) unit sales," Davis said.

  Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) is ditching unit sales disclosures in its new   fiscal year, further emphasizing its growing (and highly   profitable) services business. Meanwhile, guidance for the   December quarter left investors wanting more.In this segment from    Industry Focus: Tech     , host Dylan Lewis and Fool.com contributor Evan Niu discuss the   Mac maker's fiscal fourth quarter.A full transcript follows the video.     Find out why Apple is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market. (In fact, the newsletter     they run,     Motley Fool Stock Advisor,      has tripled the market!*)Tom and David just revealed their ten top stock picks for     investors to buy right now. Apple     is on the list      -- but there are nine others you may be overlooking. Click here to get access to the full       list!  *Stock Advisor returns as of August 6, 2018  This video was recorded on Nov. 2, 2018.  Dylan Lewis:    Our last company today is Apple. This is one of our favorite ones   to talk about. Usually, this is the boring quarter for Apple. The   stock is down 7% since they reported. What happened? Evan Niu:    [laughs] There's a lot going on here with Apple's earnings. One   of the big reasons it's down is that the guidance for the next   quarter wasn't too great. We can get to that later. Revenue   jumped about 20% to $62.9 billion, which is ahead of the   company's own guidance. iPhone unit volumes were about flat at 47   million. But iPhone revenue increased 29% to $37 billion, which   is really just more of the same that we've been seeing play out   over the past year. Ever since they introduced the $1,000 iPhone   X last year, they've been pulling this lever hard on pricing.   Pricing is really where all the growth in this business is coming   from nowadays. Units are basically flat. The past four quarters,   units have been more or less flat, but revenue has been up   considerably because they're charging so much for these phones   now. Lewis:    It's kind of incredible that, at a $1 trillion company, and a   company that's putting up tens of billions of dollars in revenue,   they are still capable of doing 20% growth. Not that we should   necessarily expect that going forward, but it's worth emphasizing   that a little bit here. Some of that is due to the success of the   iPhone segment. Some of that is due to the success of their   services segment. Niu:    Services hit a new record at $10 million in revenue for the   quarter. A year ago, they had a one-time positive adjustment of   $640 million related to a change in an accounting estimate. But   if you exclude that one-time item, that basically means they grew   27% this quarter on Services. On a trailing 12-month basis,   Services is now a $37 billion business. They've been reiterating   this target of $50 billion by 2020. They continue to march,   slowly but surely. Every quarter, they're marching closer and   closer to that goal. They're right on schedule. Lewis:    The story with this quarter for me is, past results were great,   but we're going to see some major shifts in how this company   reports. I think that really signals some major changes with what   the company expects from some of their product lines. The   financial reporting that we've gotten used to for Apple is going   to be almost unrecognizable soon. Niu:    Right. They made some very big announcements that are going to be   really important for investors, in terms of how they do their   financial reporting starting in the new fiscal year. They just   closed their fiscal year, so we're starting fiscal 2019. The big   one is that they're no longer going to report unit sales, which   is going to be very controversial, because that's always been one   of the most-watched metrics with Apple. They're also going to   start breaking things down and separating between Products and   Services. They're going to give more granular detail around the   cost of revenue for Products and Services. You'll get a much   better sense of the margin profile for Services vs. Products.   With their emphasis on Services over the past couple of years,   which is much more profitable, I think that's a good thing. But,   of course, it's a bad thing that you're going to lose the unit   data.They've been trying to shift this focus in the narrative away   from hardware to services for two or three years now. This is the   culmination. They're just getting rid of the units altogether.   They can't get clearer than that. They've been subtly saying,   "Hey, stop paying attention to units." And now, they're like,   "You can't pay attention to units anymore." You're not getting a   choice anymore. Lewis:    And you've spent so many quarters and so many years putting   together these very excellent Apple charts that track ASPs,   what's going on unit sales. Evan, all those beautiful charts are   going to be rendered obsolete! It's such a shame!In some ways, we get some more transparency. In some ways, we   get less transparency. For my money, given what a big part of the   business the iPhone segment is, I would like to know the workings   there and understand what's going on on the unit side, what's   going on on the pricing side. Obviously, my opinion doesn't   matter much, because they've already decided to make this   decision. We just have to take some solace in the fact that we'll   have a better feel for what's going on on the Services side.Also, looking forward, we hinted at this before, the guidance   that they gave for next quarter is going to be a big deceleration   from that 20% growth that we just saw. Niu:    At the midpoint, guidance is about $91 billion. That's about 3%   growth off of a year ago when they did $88 billion. This is kind   of like we talked about before -- you have such a huge business,   you're running into the law of large numbers. It's really hard to   put up double-digit growth rates off such a humongous revenue   base. There's some speculation, are they going to guide to a $100   billion quarter? That would have been mind-boggling. I mean, not   that that was expected. Analysts were at about $93 billion. So,   they do have to hit the high end of their guidance to meet   analyst expectations. It's certainly possible, they've done that   on multiple occasions on the December quarter, which is their   busiest quarter. It's kind of silly that people are disappointed   with it. They're going to be selling a billion dollars' worth of   stuff every day. How are you disappointed with that? Lewis:    That's nothing to sneeze at. With the sell-off, Apple is actually   dangerously close to falling below that $1 trillion mark that   they were the first company to hit. Evan, we've talked about   Apple a lot. We have both owned the stock for quite some time. I   think the crazy growth days for this company are over. If you're   a new investor, this is not your older cousin's Apple that's   going to be doubling every two years. What are you doing with   your Apple shares? How are you thinking about this business? Niu:    I'm not doing anything with it. I've always been a long-term   shareholder with Apple. I've never had any temptations to sell it   or anything like that. Even if the growth isn't really there   anymore, it's also worth remembering, this buyback program that   they have is so massive. Even if their top line isn't growing a   lot, your earnings per share are going to be growing quite a bit.   That will help drive the valuation of the shares and keep them   cheap, which can actually help translate into more share gains.   Not that they're going to double from here. [laughs] But, the   buyback program, they bought back over $60 billion worth of stock   this year so far. Ever since tax reform, they've bought back $20   billion a quarter over the past three quarters. That's not going   away anytime soon. That's going to help keep that bottom line EPS   number strong for years to come. Lewis:    Yeah. They've been really excellent to their shareholders, in   terms of capital returns. That's not going to change. That's one   thing I think we can continue to bank on, so long as that cash   hoard is nice and big, and so long as the Services segment and   the iPhone segment continue to post pretty solid results. I can   think we can rest assured that that's going to be the case. Niu:    This stock is so cheap. I've always considered it a very safe   stock. They're trading at a discount to the market, something   like 13X earnings. This stock is so cheap. It's not going to tank   or anything. It's a pretty reliable play there.

Markets closed higher on Tuesday, as investors eagerly waited to gauge the results of U.S. midterm elections. This made investors put aside concerns over global trade tensions and rising interest rates, as they hoped that the result would provide some relief to stocks after suffering one of the worst Octobers.Despite a late afternoon spike in buying, trading volume remained low, as investors preferred to hold back on making bets in case of a surprise outcome in the midterm elections. However, all three major indexes ended in positive territory.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) gained 0.7% to close at 25,635.01. The S&P 500 advanced 0.6% to close at 2,755.45. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,375.96, gaining 0.6%. A total of 6.85 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, significantly lower than the last 20-session average of 8.7 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.66-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.58-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.How did the Benchmark Perform?The Dow gained 173.31 points, as shares of International Business Machines Corporation IBM and Caterpillar, Inc. CAT rallied. Shares of IBM and Caterpillar gained 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively.  Caterpillar has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .The S&P 500 added 17.14 points, with each of the 11 major sectors ending the day in positive territory. The gains were led by industrials and materials sectors. The Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) and the Industrial Service Select Sector SPDR (XLI) gained 1.6% and 1.1%, respectively.The tech-heavy Nasdaq, which suffered on Monday after Apple's stock decline weighed on the index, rebounded on Tuesday gaining 47.11 points. Shares of Apple Inc. AAPL and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN gained 1.1% and 0.9%, respectively.Investors Await Midterm Elections ResultsOn Tuesday, investors put aside concerns over rising global trade tensions and worries of rapidly rising interest rates and eagerly awaited the results of the U.S. midterm elections, which could have significant impact markets.The midterm elections will decide which party controls Congress. Democrats are expected to take control of the House from the Republicans, while the GOP will maintain a slim majority in the Senate. Historically, stocks tend to fall before midterm elections and rally once the voting is over. Moreover, stocks have historically performed well under a divided government.On Tuesday, investors eagerly awaited the results of the congressional elections. If Democrats take control of the House, it could lead the Congress to pursue different policy agendas. A Democratic House majority might work with the administration to try and lower drug prices. Moreover, the election could also lead to more investigations into President Donald Trump.Fed's Policy Meeting in FocusInvestors will also be turning their attention toward Fed Reserve, which begins its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. The Fed is expected to hold interest rates this month. Instead the central bank is likely to deliver its fourth rate rise of the year in December. However, investors will be closely analyzing policymakers' statement on Thursday for clues to gauge the future pace of monetary policy tightening.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>
Samsung gives first glimpse of foldable phone
 By Jane Lanhee Lee and Munsif Vengattil SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  unveiled its much-anticipated foldable phone in San Francisco on Wednesday, urging Android developers to start writing apps for it. The South Korean tech company needs to get the foldable phone right to reverse steep declines in profit for its mobile division and restore some of the cachet its brand has lost to Apple Inc. Justin Denison, a senior vice president of mobile product marketing, showed a prototype with a screen he said measured 7.3 inches (18.5 cm) diagonally. Folded in two it appeared to resemble a thick phone, but Samsung did not give media or developers a chance to touch or see the device up close. Dave Burke, vice president of engineering for Google's Android software platform, told a Google conference in California that Samsung planned to introduce a new Android-based device early next year. "We expect to see foldable products from several Android manufacturers," he said. Google's head of Android UX, Glen Murphy, was also on stage with Samsung and said Google would work with the developer community to bring more features to the phone. Samsung said it would be ready for mass production in the coming months. Developer Joshua Clark, who was at the conference, said Samsung needs to sell the technology to its competitors for the product to be widely adopted. "I really think it only takes two companies, and then all of the sudden it will catch on," said Clark. "And the fact that Google was on stage, that says a lot. For developers to be able to integrate it with all their apps, that gives me a lot of confidence." Analyst Bob O'Donnell with Technalysis Research said that  while the bendable screen provided a wow factor, shoppers may not like the thickness of the folded phone or its price tag. "They'll have to prove that it's more than just a gimmick," said O'Donnell. "But it's smart to open it up to developers early to do different types of experiences." Maribel Lopez, an analyst at Lopez Research, said that the product would likely be relatively expensive in the near term. "We're talking about brand new materials that have been made for this and also a new manufacturing process," said Lopez. Samsung is among a handful of developers working on foldable phones. China'sHuawei Technologies Co Ltd  has said it is planning to launch a 5G smartphone with a foldable screen in mid-2019. Samsung and Huawei, however, have been beaten to the market by Royole, a Chinese display making start-up, which last week unveiled a foldable Android phone with a 7.8 inch screen, priced from around $1,300. Royole said it would start filling orders in late December.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares of  Apple  (NASDAQ: AAPL ), while still higher by about 20% for the year-to-date, as a result of the recent slide are now also 15% off their 2018  highs. Just because a stock is "off it's highs," however, does not make it a buy. But AAPL stock is nearing better technical support that could  bode well for a year-end rally sooner rather than later.As a side note and before we start looking at the below two charts, allow me to say I continue to see Apple as a good story on the long (buy) side. It is my view that the company may have seen peak iPhone growth, but that does not mean it cannot see good growth going forward from services as well as future hardware innovations. At the same time, liking AAPL stock from a longer-term bullish perspective does not mean one has to buy/chase it higher at any price.
 Click to EnlargeMoving averages legend: red - 200 week, blue - 100 week, yellow - 50 weekOn the multiyear weekly chart, we see that AAPL stock over the past decade or so has found a well-defined upward sloping trading range … albeit a wide one at that. Earlier this year in April the stock began to accelerate higher and out of this range, thus forming/completing a steeper uptrending range. By August and just before the broader market as measured by the S&P 500 found its year-to-date top, AAPL stock even overshot this second steeper ascending channel. It was just a matter of time until a mean-reversion move would set in that gets the stock back into this steeper channel.Through a multiyear lens I still think AAPL stock is overbought and I would prefer to buy more of it should it eventually move lower and back into the main upward moving channel. But I will give myself plenty of time and exercise patience to do this.
 Click to EnlargeMoving averages legend: red - 200 day, blue - 100 day, yellow - 50 dayMoving on to the daily chart, we see that as a result of the recent 15% pullback, AAPL stock has sliced below its 50- and 100-day simple moving averages - the yellow and blue lines respectively. The MACD momentum oscillator at the bottom of the chart is also oversold. While the stock could begin to bounce from here into  year-end, personally I would like to see it test its red 200-day simple moving average with more vigor and then begin to bounce. Because that type of price action however is only my "wish," we have to approach this a little differently.I still see AAPL stock as a good candidate for a year-end bounce, so buying some stock or at-the-money call spreads using  January options around the $200 mark makes sense. This to me, however, is more about building up a position, which is to say that I would look to buy more should the stock ultimately visit the 200-day moving average (or lower) around the $190 area. My upside target for now for Apple stock into year-end is around $220.Get FREE ACCESS to Serge's renowned Stock Market Scanner with actionable trade ideas.

 Apple Inc. AAPL  recently announced that it won't be reporting sales numbers for iPhone, iPad, Mac or any of its hardware products in its quarterly reports. Demand for iPhone has been slowing for some time now. In its fiscal fourth quarter, iPhone sales barely grew from a year earlier.Understandably, the company now wants to project itself as more of a services business. That said, many market analysts believe that Apple's decision is in a move to hide the pain of slowing iPhone demand. This has also been taking a toll of Apple's shares. Also, the tech sector, particularly FAANG stocks, comprising Facebook, Inc. FB  , Alphabet Inc. GOOGL  , Amazon.com Inc. AMZN  , Apple and Netflix Inc. NFLX  , has been suffering lately, taking a toll on markets. Apple to Stop Reporting iPhone Sales Number Last week, Apple on its earnings call announced that it would no longer report sales figures for iPhone, iPad, Mac and other hardware products in its quarterly reports. The announcement came alongside slowing iPhone unit sales. Apple said that in its fiscal fourth quarter, iPhone sales barely grew from the year-ago period, although the company launched a number of new devices.The company sold 46.89 million iPhones during the quarter ended Sep 30. Following this, Apple's shares slid 6.6% on Nov 2, marking its biggest single-day decline since January 2014. Naturally, Apple's decision has raised questions in the mind of analysts. Slowing demand for iPhone has been a growing concern for Apple and many analysts believe that by no longer reporting iPhone sales figures, the company wants to hide the pain of slowing demand for iPhone. Interestingly, Apple has time and again been praised for being one of the only tech companies to share sales numbers of its major products in each quarter. Apple this time said that reporting sales numbers in every quarter doesn't present an appropriate picture of Apple's performance.However, slowing demand for iPhone hasn't been hurting the company's profits, as it has been hiking prices of its products. Apple posted revenues of $62.90 billion for the quarter ended September 2018, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.29%. Also, Apple now wants to project itself as more of a services business. The company reported that revenues from services reached an all-time high of $10 billion, 17% higher than the year-ago period. Tech Sector Continues to Suffer Apple's shares have taken a beating lately, with the situation worsening after the company gave a weak guidance and warned that sales for the all-important holiday quarter could likely miss expectations. Moreover, the decision to not report iPhone sales has further raised questions in the minds of analysts and investors.However, tech stocks, particularly the FAANG group, have been one of the major drivers of the markets' long rally. However, despite being the third-best performer on the S&P 500 index, tech stocks have had a rough 2018. And one of the major reasons behind this roller-coaster ride has been growing fears of trade war. Apple, Google, Netflix, Facebook and Amazon each carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see   the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here  . Also, on Nov 5, Amazon's shares tumbled after President Donald Trump said that the administration was looking into the antitrust violations committed by the company. Moreover, renewed concerns over user data privacy and security after breaches and vulnerabilities by the likes of Facebook and Google are also affecting tech companies. Facebook has been punished by investors time and again since it got embroiled in a data misuse scandal involving Cambridge Analytica. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric   Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think.  See This Ticker Free >>  
 You might not know it, but one of the unsung heroes of the   stock market so far this year had been   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) . The iPhone maker was one of the few companies to   buck the recent market rout, going into its earnings release up   more than 31% in 2018.With that kind of performance, investors were looking for a   better-than-average earnings report in order to justify a   continued ascent in the stock price, similar to its   unexpected strength in the third quarter    . Unfortunately a strong earnings report was dampened by weak   guidance and an unexpected announcement, which conspired to strip   Apple of its   $1 trillion market cap.

It reported revenue of $62.9 billion,   up 20% year over year, and exceeding both analysts' consensus   estimates of $61.48 billion and the high end of Apple's forecast   -- which topped out at $62 billion. Profits were also a pleasant   surprise, as earnings per share of $2.91 sailed past expectations   of $2.78 per share.The iPhone continued to make up the lion's share of Apple's   sales at $37.2 billion, up 29% year over year. The company sold   46.9 million units, up less than 1% year over year, and falling   short of the 48.4 million expected by analysts. That didn't stop   Apple from achieving near-record prices for the flagship device,   as consumers continued to choose the higher-end models, like the   recently released XS and XS Max; they paid an average of $793 for   the iPhone, up 28% year over year, and just shy of the record   $796 achieved in the first quarter.Apple's Other Products segment -- made up of the Apple Watch,   AirPods, Apple TV, Beats headphones, and HomePod -- again   reported the highest segment growth, producing revenue of $4.2   billion, up 31% year over year.Services also got a nod from Apple execs, as revenue from the   segment "reached an all-time high of $10 billion"; excluding a   one-time adjustment in Q4 of 2017, its revenue increased 27% year   over year. Apple has generated $37.2 billion from services over   the preceding four quarters, putting it on track to reach its   goal of $51 billion annually from the segment by 2020."We concluded a record year with our best September quarter   ever, growing double digits in every geographic segment. We set   September quarter revenue records for iPhone and Wearables and   all-time quarterly records for Services and Mac," said Apple's   CFO Luca Maestri in a press release.In an unexpected move, Apple executives said they would no   longer report the individual product unit sales figures for the   iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers that have historically been part   of the company's financial disclosures. Combine that with Apple's   miss this quarter in unit sales for the iPhone, and it appears   Apple wants to mask weaker unit sales from now on.For the fiscal first quarter (which began Oct. 1), Apple is   forecasting revenue of $91 billion at the midpoint of its   guidance. The company is expecting gross margin of between 38%   and 38.5%, and operating expenses in a range of $8.7 billion to   $8.8 billion.For their part, analysts' consensus estimates are calling for   revenue of $92.91 billion, an increase of 5% year over year, and   earnings per share of $4.94, up 27% compared to the prior-year   quarter.The fiscal first quarter includes the highly important holiday   shopping season, and is typically Apple's best quarter, setting   the stage for the entire year. The company's muted growth   estimates and the decision to stop reporting device unit sales   gave investors an uneasy feeling, and took the sheen off an   otherwise stellar quarter. Apple wants investors to focus more on   the big picture, but sometimes the devil's in the details.

 By Stephen Nellis Nov 7 (Reuters) - Apple Inc  is not in talks "at any level" to settle its wide-ranging legal dispute with mobile chip maker Qualcomm Inc, according to a source familiar with the matter. In the past, Apple used Qualcomm's modem chips in its flagship iPhone models to help them connect to wireless data networks. But early last year, Apple sued Qualcomm in federal court in  San Diego, alleging that the chip company's practice of taking a cut of the selling price of phones as a patent license fee was illegal. A source familiar with the situation said this week that there are no settlement talks between Apple and Qualcomm. "There is absolutely no meaningful discussion taking place between us and Qualcomm, and there is no settlement in sight," the person said. "We are gearing up for trial." Qualcomm did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The case is to go to trial early next year and has spawned related legal actions in other courts around the world. In July, Qualcomm's chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, told investors on the company's quarterly earnings call that the two companies were in talks to resolve the litigation. "We continue to talk. We also have a number of ... legal strategies that are in flight," Mollenkopf said on the call. "And we hope that through the combination of either those paths, we could get to a resolution, and we're confident that we will."    In addition to its dispute with Apple, Qualcomm is in a dispute with another phone maker, widely believed by analysts to be China'sHuawei Technologies Co Ltd, that is withholding payments. But talks with Huawei appear to be progressing. In July, Qualcomm received what its patent licensing chief, Alex Rogers, called a "good faith partial payment" of $500 million from the non-paying phone maker, which Qualcomm executives said was a sign of progress in the talks. Qualcomm is slated to receive $200 million more in such payments, the executives have said. Qualcomm is also trying to settle an antitrust lawsuit brought against it by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission days before Apple filed its lawsuit. But that effort suffered a setback on Tuesday, when a federal judge in San Jose, California, issued a preliminary ruling saying that Qualcomm must license some patents involved in making modem chips to rivals such as Intel Corp, a move that could jeopardize Qualcomm's existing licensing practices.

 By Cate Cadell WUZHEN, China, Nov 7 (Reuters) - China should have a more prominent role in shaping the future of the global internet, President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday in remarks that underscored how battle lines for control of the web have hardened amid a biting trade war with the United States. The official opening of the World Internet Conference, which last year attracted Apple Inc  CEO Tim Cook and Alphabet Inc  head Sundar Pichai, was more muted this year and did not include previous calls for a more open internet. "It indicates they are less convinced about successful broad-based cooperation, particularly - if not expressed explicitly - with the United States," he told Reuters. Xi, like last year, did not attend the event in person in the town of Wuzhen. In a speech read out for him at the event, Xi said there was "an urgent need for us to speed up the internet economy and work for governance that is more fair and equitable." China and Xi have pushed for a bigger role in global internet governance even while calling on nations to respect Beijing's "cyber sovereignty", an idea that countries should be free to control and censor their internet as they see fit. Technology and the internet are key battlegrounds in a trade war between China and the United States, with a spotlight on U.S. complaints about intellectual property theft and China's ambitions to become a global leader in cutting edge tech. Foreign websites such as Alphabet's Google and Facebook Inc  are blocked in China, where authorities also tightly control online content and censor or punish those who post material seen as opposed to "core socialist values". Xi's comments come as China's technology and internet firms have taken a hit from rising uncertainty linked to the trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, and also greater involvement of the Chinese state in online industries. While the heads of Apple and Alphabet did not attend this year, conference delegates did hear from the chief executives of U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc  and Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. Tencent chief Pony Ma said China's economy was resilient and the country's internet sector had a bright future despite hurdles. Tencent has seen its stock fall nearly 30 percent this year amid a crackdown on gaming, one of its main profit drivers. "We have suffered from twists and challenges in the past," he said. "Going forward we still want to realize the dream of making China a powerful internet country." 
 
 By Arnab  Paul and Vibhuti Sharma BENGALURU, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Software engineer Samee Alam was ready to take the big leap and buy an iPhone in this week's Diwali festival sales, but at the last minute he opted for cheaper Chinese competitor OnePlus instead. Alam, 27, spends hours on his phone watching shows, surfing and shopping, making him the perfect target for Apple Inc  as it strives to raise sales among India's 1.3 billion consumers. Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Research says that iPhone sales are falling as a result. From three million phones in 2017, sales may sink to two million this year, according to their estimate, the first decline in four years.  More than half of those sales will come from cheaper older models, and the lack of progress in India was among problems cited by Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook when he gave a disappointing holiday outlook last week. Even in the premium segment, smartphones that cost more than $400, Apple lagged Samsung and China's OnePlus in the (graphic). "I have never used an iPhone and I was keen on getting my hands on one but it didn't make sense," says Alam, who works for one of the raft of firms to have invested in the southern city of Bengaluru, often called India'sSilicon Valley. "I look for storage, camera and processor in phones and cheaper alternatives like OnePlus are more value for the money. The new iPhones cost almost 100,000 rupees - I can get three good phones for that price or even a decent gaming laptop." Solid Mac sales and the high unit price of iPhones meant Apple's total revenue of $2 billion in India last year was still double that of OnePlus, which only sells mobile phones. But Counterpoint's data says that gap will also shrink. OnePlus' India head Vikas Agarwal told Reuters this week that 10-15 percent of new customers in recent months have been defectors from Apple, suggesting even some loyalists are opting out of upgrading their handsets. 
 HIGH IMPORT DUTIES Apple's problems go beyond price. The company, facing down a handful of regulatory headaches, lost some of its top executives in India at the start of this year. An Apple spokesman said the departures had nothing to do with the company's performance, but people familiar with the matter told Reuters that the departures were likely linked to the company changing its distribution system. Apple has cut the number of distributors in the country to two from five.  The sources, who declined to be identified because they have business relationships with Apple, also said company veteran Michel Columb is still working on solidifying business relations since taking control of the Indian operation in December. Apple declined to comment further.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has sought to drive electronics producers into manufacturing locally by steadily moving tariffs up the supply chain from simple phone cases to sophisticated chipsets and boards. Along with local firms like Lava, global smartphone giants including Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Oppo and Xiaomi Corp  have responded aggressively, investing millions of dollars in plants around Bengaluru and Delhi tech hub Noida. Apple is the only major player which does not manufacture phones in the country and it only assembles two low-cost older models through Wistron Corp  in Bengaluru. Industry experts say as a result the company still imports about 70-80 percent of its phones. That results in high import duties, which in turn make the phones expensive. In the United States, the basic iPhone XR model costs $749 or roughly 54,400 rupees, only two thirds of its retail price in India. Beyond that, while U.S. phones are subsidized under deals with wireless carriers, Apple's phones in India are not. "Apple doesn't have enough confidence ... in the Indian manufacturing system right now, to set up plants and move some of the manufacturing out of China," said analyst Navkendar Singh of tech consulting firm IDC. "In the process they are losing around 15-20 percent of their tax incentive ... which they could have passed on to the consumer." 
 EMPTY STORES Diwali, the Festival of Lights, is peak selling time for electronics in India, but the Apple-licensed store in one of Bengaluru's big shopping malls was deserted this past Saturday. "Features of the emerging phones are very similar to an iPhone," says salesman Aejaz Ahmed, adding volumes have fallen in the past few months. "It is very difficult to make out the difference from a distance because they even look so alike." Sales staff at several stores in Bengaluru and nearby Chennai pointed to the launch this year of the latest OnePlus phone as a major problem for the U.S. phonemaker. At 37,999 rupees, the Chinese company's 6T is half the price of the XR. The result, says Neil Shah, from Counterpoint, is that Apple's user base in India is set to decline about 10 percent to nine million users this year. That compares to an estimated 436 million Android users. "If your user base is declining, you are losing grip on the market," he says. "The new customer base is not coming." 
 
Apple's Services Business Has Another Stellar Year
  Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) currently generates most of its revenue and profit   from sales of its highly lucrative iPhone smartphone franchise.   In fact, during its fiscal 2018, iPhone sales   grew 18% to $166.7 billion    , accounting for nearly 62.8% of the company's total sales that   year.It's simply a beast of a business.  Image source: Apple.Over the years, though, Apple's services business -- which the   company said in its most recent annual filing "[includes] revenue   from Digital Content and Services, AppleCare,   Apple Pay    , licensing and other services" -- has become its second-largest   business by revenue thanks to consistent and significant sales   growth.Let's dive into how this segment performed in fiscal 2018.Apple's services business turned in approximately $37.2   billion in sales in fiscal 2018 -- up 24% from what it generated   in its prior fiscal year.Now, Apple mentions in its most recent 10-K filing that its   services business in 2018 "included a favorable one-time item of   $236 million in connection with the final resolution of various   lawsuits."Naturally, during Apple's most recent earnings call, CEO Tim   Cook said that "[excluding] the impact of a favorable one-time   accounting adjustment of $640 million a year ago, our services   growth was 27%."Apple's services business made up almost 13.1% of the   company's total revenue in fiscal 2017 and expanded to 14% in   fiscal year 2018. That's still nowhere close to the contribution   of the iPhone, but the segment is clearly growing in   importance.Moreover, I'd expect Apple's services business to continue to   outgrow iPhone, iPad, and Mac over time -- segments that, in   aggregate, made up about 79.4% of total revenue in fiscal 2018 --   so the odds look good that the segment will continue to grow as a   percentage of Apple's overall revenue for years to come.During the call, Cook had a lot of good news to share around   the performance of the company's services business."We set new Q4 records in all of our geographic segments and   new all-time revenue records for the App Store, cloud services,   AppleCare, Apple Music and Apple Pay," Cook said. He also added   that Apple "continued to see strong growth in paid subscriptions   reaching over 330 million in our ecosystem."On Apple Pay, Cook bragged that it is "by far the No. 1 mobile   contactless payment service worldwide" and "generated   significantly more transactions than even   PayPal    Mobile with over four times the growth rate."In case you didn't catch PayPal's most recent earnings   release, the company said in its third-quarter report that it   "processed $143 billion in [total payment volume] in the third   quarter," of which $57 billion came from mobile payments.CFO Luca Maestri also said on the call that the company's   still "well on our way to achieve our goal to double our fiscal   2016 services revenue by 2020."Recall that the company generated $24.35 billion in services   revenue in its fiscal 2016, so if the company delivers on its   stated ambition, then investors should expect Apple's fiscal year   2020 services revenue to be in the in the vicinity of $49   billion.

Wall Street's market averages closed at their session highs as upbeat earnings and bullish labor market data kept stocks afloat while investors waited for election results that could galvanize President Donald Trump's pro-business, trade-protectionist policies. Led by gains in Caterpillar ( CAT  ), Boeing ( BA  ) and International Business Machines ( IBM  ), the Dow closed above its 100-day moving average for the first time in three weeks.Early defensiveness dissolved at the NYSE open as market participants shifted focus away from the election uncertainties to encouraging quarterly results and a rebound in the tech sector with Apple ( AAPL  ), Facebook ( FB  ) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) higher for the first time in several days.Data on the labor market was also a factor in today's positive price action as the number of available jobs continues to outstrip available workers. According to the monthly job openings and labor turnover survey (JOLTS) open positions declined slightly in September to 7.009 million from an upwardly revised 7.293 million (7.136 million initially) in August.Demand for risk was evidenced by cheaper  gold prices  and the Treasury 10-year note cracking the 3.20% yield threshold. A very well received 10-year note auction (with the exception of anemic demand from direct bidders) drove the yield to a four-week high of 3.22%. Higher borrowing costs failed to dent the mood on Wall Street as the small-cap Russell 2000 closed at its highest level since mid-October.While Wednesday's price action will likely reflect the outcome to the election (a split Congress is seen as bearish for Wall Street), the start of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting will also come into focus. The FOMC is not expected to raise interest rates at the policy meeting conclusion Thursday, but their statement will be gleaned for clues for the timing of the next hike.US MARKETSDow Jones Industrial Average was up 173.31 points (+0.68%)S&P 500 was up 17.19 points (+0.63%)Nasdaq Composite Index was up 47.11 points (+0.64%)GLOBAL SENTIMENTFTSE 100 was down 0.89%Nikkei 225 was up 1.14%Hang Seng Index was up 0.72%Shanghai China Composite Index was down 0.23%UPSIDE MOVERS(+) CVON (+31.60%) To be taken private for $1.8 billion(+) ELF (+19.19%) Beat Q3 EPS and sales expectations(+) MOR (+16.83%) Reported better-than-expected quarterly results(+) FN (+10.62%) Q1 earnings beat estimatesDOWNSIDE MOVERS:(-) ONCS (-49.82%) Released disappointing results from TAVO and Keytruda study(-) GSKY (-36.70%) Missed revenue estimates, lowered full year EPS guidance(-) FTDR (-29.18%) Q3 earnings misses estimates as revenue beat expectations
Shares of Roku ROKU have plummeted over 16% during the last month as part of the larger market pullback. But the streaming TV firm still looks strong ahead of its third-quarter earnings release Wednesday.OverviewRoku went public in the fall of 2017 and benefited from its presence in the internet entertainment revolution. On top of that, the firm looks impressive based on its own credentials. The company sells an array of devices that allow customers to watch their favorite streaming services such as Netflix NFLX and Amazon AMZN Prime all in one place, similar to Apple AAPL TV or Google's GOOGL Chromecast.Furthermore, the Roku Channel and its new targeted advertising push look poised to help boost revenues. The Roku Channel allows users to watch hundreds of streaming movies and TV shows for free without a subscription.Roku's active accounts jumped 46% year-over-year to 22.0 million in the second quarter. Maybe more importantly, Roku's average revenue per user surged 48% to reach $16.60 as streaming hours skyrocketed 57%. Meanwhile, the company's overall revenue also jumped 57% to $156.8 million. Plus, the company said that roughly one in four smart TVs sold in the U.S. in the first half of 2018 were Roku TVs.Stock PriceMoving on, we can clearly see that shares of Roku have soared since the firm went public at $14 per share in September 2017. Shares of Roku skyrocketed to as high as $77.57 per share at the start of October. Investors should note that Roku stock closed Monday at $56.85 per share, down roughly 27% from its 52-week high.Roku shares slipped once again through late afternoon trading Tuesday, which sets up what could prove to be a solid buying point.OutlookRoku is projected to see its revenues climb by 36.97% to reach $170.91 million, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. Meanwhile, the company's full-year revenues are projected to hit $722.45 million, which would mark a nearly 41% surge.        At the other end of the income statement, Roku is expected to post an adjusted loss of $0.13 per share, which is hardly uncommon for a young tech company. Plus, Roku has earned some positive earnings estimate revisions over the last seven days for Q3, as well as for fiscal 2018 and 2019.Bottom Line Roku is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) based on its recent positive earnings estimate revision activity. The company sports an "A" grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. It is also worth pointing out that Roku crushed our quarterly earnings estimates in the trailing three periods. Therefore, based on its own growth prospects and Roku's position in the booming internet-based TV industry, it seems like Roku stock might be worth considering before its Q3 earnings release.Roku is scheduled to release its third quarter 2018 financial results after the market closes on Wednesday.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies

 By Stephen Nellis and Paresh Dave Nov 6 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp  said it is seeking a sponsor in Congress for a U.S. data privacy bill it drafted that would shield companies from fines if they attest to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission annually that they take strong measures to protect consumer data. Federal and state officials could still force companies to change their data practices and even pay restitution under the proposal, which Intel wrote and began talking to Congress members about this week in an unusual step for a corporation. David Hoffman, Intel's global privacy officer, told Reuters on Tuesday that executives' fear of imprisonment would drive "the best privacy protection you can get." Intel itself does not collect much consumer data. Big data collectors, such as Facebook Inc  and Alphabet Inc'sGoogle, are among the top buyers of Intel's lucrative computer server chips. Hoffman said increasing consumer privacy concerns over the last five years have lead to "pushback" on electronic health records and education data systems. "That's all bad for our business," he said. Marc Groman, an adjunct law professor at Georgetown University and former White House senior adviser on privacy, said Intel's proposal should be taken seriously. He described the safe harbor from fines as reasonable and the grant of rulemaking authority to the FTC as crucial for the legislation to keep up with new technology. Data privacy has become a pressing political issue in the United States, with major technology companies Facebook, Google and Twitter Inc  questioned by Congress on their practices. In Europe, a General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, took effect in May. Breaking privacy laws in Europe can now result in fines of up to 4 percent of a firm's global revenue. The Intel proposal caps fines at $1 billion and unlike GDPR, does not have a provision requiring companies to notify victims of data breaches. In the United States, California this year passed tough new privacy rules that tech companies say will be difficult to comply with. In September, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc  and other companies told Congress they would support a federal law overriding California's rules, which go into effect in 2020. 
 
 Disney's DIS  $71.3 billion deal to buy key 21st Century Fox FOXA  assets took a major step forward after European Union authorities approved the acquisition Tuesday. But Disney's Fox deal won't impact its fiscal Q4 financial results. So, let's see what investors should expect from Disney's largest business units, which house everything from ESPN to its theme parks. Disney Overview Disney's offer to buy some of Fox's largest entertainment assets earned approval  from the European Commission, under the condition that Disney divest its interests in channels such as History and Lifetime in the European Economic Area. The EU, the U.S. Justice Department, and both companies' shareholders have now approved the deal.Disney's acquisition of Fox's film and TV studios, among other assets, is designed to help it fight Netflix NFLX  and Amazon AMZN  in the new streaming age and boost its box office sales. Fox's film and TV studios will bolster the media conglomerate's array of assets that currently include Star Wars  production company Lucasfilm, Marvel Entertainment, Pixar, and its namesake studio.Bob Iger's company plans to roll out its stand-alone streaming service in late 2019. The likes of AT&T T  and Apple AAPL  are set to join Disney, which has found early success with its ESPN+ streaming service. With all that said, we need to know what to expect from Disney when it reports its fiscal Q4 financial results after the closing bell Thursday.     Fourth Quarter Disney's adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to jump 22.4% to reach $1.31 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. Meanwhile, at the top of the income statement, the company's Q4 revenues are projected to jump roughly 8.1% to reach $13.81 billion.These are solid growth projection for DIS. But we still need to know what to expect from the media powerhouse's specific business units, as their performances could easily determine how DIS stock trades following its earnings release.Luckily, we can turn to our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file to prepare for this. The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non-financial metrics reported by companies. The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts. Media Networks Let's start with Disney's Media Networks unit. This segment is made up of its cable and broadcast division, which includes sports media power ESPN, ABC, Freeform, and more.Media Networks revenues are projected to climb 4% from $5.465 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 to touch $5.688 billion.It is worth noting that Media Networks revenues slipped 3% in the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, Disney's largest division popped 5% in Q3. And remember to pay close attention to any and all ESPN updates, including ESPN+ spending news. Parks and Resorts Moving on, Disney's Park and Resorts revenues are expected to jump approximately 11.5% from $4.667 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 to reach $5.204 billion. Disney's theme park and resort revenues jumped 6% in both Q3 and the prior-year quarter. Studio Entertainment Meanwhile, Disney's Studio Entertainment revenues are projected to soar 27.5% from the year-ago period's $1.432 billion to touch $1.826 billion. Despite this outsized growth estimate, investors should remember that Studio Entertainment is Disney's most volatile segment based on the nature of movie release cycles and box office success.With that in mind, Studio Entertainment revenues sunk 21% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and surged 20% to reach $2.878 billion in Q3. Consumer Products & Interactive Media Lastly, we take a peek at one of Disney's less talked about divisions. The company's Consumer Products & Interactive Media leg is comprised of toy and clothing sales, licensing activities, video games, books, and apps. Our NFM estimate is calling for this unit's revenues to slip roughly 1% from $1.215 billion in  Q4 of 2017 to hit $1.201 billion. This unit sunk 8% in Q3 and 6% in the year-ago quarter.

 Earlier this year,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) laid out its long-term goal to reach "   net cash neutral    " over time, vowing to return enough capital to shareholders to   bring its net cash position to $0. That's no small task,   considering the sheer size of Apple's cash position as well as   its cash-generating capabilities. The Mac maker has historically   generated so much cash that it   can't return it fast enough    to investors, and its net cash balance had continued marching   higher for years.That all changed following tax reform last year, which is   largely what paved the way for the new net cash neutral goal.  Steve Jobs Theater. Image source: Apple.Here's a breakdown of Apple's cash position as of last   quarter:Balance Sheet MetricFiscal Q4 2018Gross cash$237.1 billionTerm debt$102.5 billionCommercial paper$12 billion Net cash  $122.6 billion Data source: SEC filings.Apple still has another $122.6 billion to give back in the   years ahead. Tax reform unlocked Apple's overseas reserves,   dramatically changing the company's ability to return capital   while also eliminating the need to keep issuing debt. Apple has   significantly ramped up its share repurchase activity, having   bought back $62.9 billion worth of stock so far this year. For   context, that's nearly as much as Apple bought back in 2016 and   2017 combined ($66.1 billion). Those aggressive buybacks this   year have helped take a meaningful chunk out of Apple's net   cash.  Data source: SEC filings. Fiscal quarters shown.It's now   been a year    since Apple conducted a bond offering, selling $7 billion worth   of paper in November 2017. As it no longer needs to raise debt   capital, the task turns to returning as much cash to shareholders   as quickly as possible, while slowly paying down debt as the   bonds mature over time. Apple has about $8.8 billion worth of   debt that matures within the next year, after paying back   approximately $7 billion in principal earlier this year.Meanwhile, the tech titan has also been   winding down    its own bond investment portfolio, letting the bonds it holds   mature without rolling them back into new investments. You can   see it playing out in the company's cash flow statement, which   shows   reduced purchasing activity    even as bond proceeds roll in.Apple is making rapid progress toward its net cash neutral   goal, but it will still take a few more years.

AirPods : It's possible that Apple is preparing to release a new set of AirPods , reports 9to5Mac . This has a new pair of AirPods from the tech company obtaining Bluetooth SIG certification. This certification mentions the wireless earbuds by name. It also notes that they will support Bluetooth 5.0. While this doesn't give strong clues as to when the next AirPods will launch, it does make it clear that they are in the works.Store Openings : AAPL is preparing to reopen two of its retails locations in the U.S. this month , MacRumors notes. The two stores that are reopening are located in White Plains, N.Y. and Santa Monica, Calif. These stores were closed by the tech company as they went through remodeling.

How Much Apple Stock Is Too Much Apple Stock?
 There must be something in the air: A lot of investors right   now are looking more closely at their asset allocations and   wondering whether they need to adjust their portfolios. For   example, the    Motley Fool Answers     mailbag this month holds a query from an investor who -- like   many of us -- has some   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares in his Roth IRA. Good for him, because as   we all know, Apple has done pretty well in recent years. But   the company is also the biggest holding in the index fund he's   invested in through his 401(k), and it's held by a couple of   other mutual funds he owns, too. Which leads him to wonder: At   what point should he start thinking about reducing his exposure   to the tech titan?In this segment, hosts Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp   weigh in, with some help from special guest Buck Hartzell,   director of investor learning and operations at The Motley   Fool.A full transcript follows the video.     Find out why Apple is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

"Now that Apple is a   trillion-dollar corporation, I started digging into how much of   it I actually own. When I first started with The Motley Fool, I   began building out my Roth IRA and   Stock Advisor    picks, which included Apple as one of my first Starter Stocks,   but it's also the top holding in the index fund in my 401(k) and   it's also in a couple of other mutual funds I own. Should I sell   my small position in Apple that lives in my Roth to be able to   reinvest those funds into another stock that has greater   potential to grow? How many Apples is too many Apples?" Buck Hartzell:    A good question, Jim! First of all, congratulations for actually   looking. A lot of people who own mutual funds don't understand   the concentrations of the funds and there's overlapping kinds of   concentrations that can build up. Apple's an obvious one if you   own ETFs or mutual funds. They're in just about everything   because they're so big and so liquid.I looked yesterday.   Vanguard    , if you own the S&P 500; about 4.19% of that mutual fund is   in Apple. And then, of course, if you own it in your own   portfolios as an individual stock, as well, you can easily get a   big percentage that you didn't really know about. So good for   checking. If you haven't checked,   Morningstar    has a cute, little tool. It's called Instant X-Ray or Portfolio   X-Ray. Just google "Morningstar" and "X-Ray Tool." You can put in   your mutual funds and your individual stocks, and then you can   see the overlapping percentages of everything.So whether you should sell it or not; the nice thing is you   have this individual position in a Roth, so you don't have any   tax consequences for selling it or not. I'd say that's an   individual decision based on what percent you have in there. You   didn't tell us that, Jim, but I'd say generally around 10% gets   around the high side where you might feel a little bit   uncomfortable having that much allocated to it. Like you said,   there's no consequences to selling it, so that's fine.Generally we tell people, though, if you like the company and   how well they're performing, don't sell just for the sake of   selling, but that 10% is a rough area where you might get   uncomfortable.

Motley Fool Answers October Mailbag: Allocation, Allocation, Allocation
 It must be something in the air: For whatever reason, a lot of   investors right now are looking more closely at their asset   allocations, and wondering whether they need to adjust their   portfolios. Should a person be heavier in small-cap stocks than   large-cap stocks? What should you do when the same stocks you   hold individually are also in your mutual funds? Are bond funds   riskier than we think? And what should you do when one   high-flying company grows enough to account for half of your   portfolio's value?In this    Motley Fool Answers      episode, hosts Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp pull   those questions and others from the mailbag, and dole out their   best advice with help from Buck Hartzell, director of investor   learning and operations at The Motley Fool.A full transcript follows the video.     10 stocks we like better than Walmart       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock     tip, it can pay to listen.

I'm Alison Southwick and I'm joined, as always, by Robert   Brokamp, personal finance expert here at The Motley Fool. Robert Brokamp:    Hi, Alison! Southwick:    It's the October Mailbag, and this week we're going to answer   your investing-related questions with the help of Buck Hartzell.   Most of the questions, today, have to do with portfolio   allocation, I noticed, so if those two words get you excited,   boy, have we got a show for you. All that and more on this week's   episode of   Motley Fool Answers    .__ Southwick:    Hey, Buck! Thanks for joining us again! Buck Hartzell:    Thank you, Alison and Robert! Thank you for having me back   again! Brokamp:    Always a pleasure! Southwick:    I also want to thank Austin, who is behind the glass today   stepping in for Rick. Thanks, Austin, for filling in at the last   minute! Rick learned that he is allergic to oysters. Brokamp:    What? Is that why he's home? Southwick:    Yeah! Hartzell:    That can't be good. Thanks for staying home, Rick! Southwick:    So future Rick, when you're listening to this, hope you're   feeling better. Murr! So, should we just get into the   questions? Brokamp:    Let's do it! Southwick:    Let's do it! The first question is from Alexander. "I'm 27 years   old and hoping to retire somewhere between 65 and 67. How can I   decide the right mix between large, mid, and small-cap equities?   From what I see on the web, small caps have performed the best.   Since I have many years until retirement, it seems to me that I   can afford to take the risk and have more of my money in small   caps. Yet, advisors and the resources I found online shy away   from having a large percentage in small-cap companies. Also, my   mother-in-law is about 11 years from being 67 and retiring.   What's a smart mix for her?" Brokamp:    Well, Alexander, let's start with the outperformance of small-cap   stocks. Those numbers often come from Ibbotson, which has numbers   from 1926 to 2017. Over that period, small-cap stocks returned   about 12.1% compared to large-cap stocks, which are 10.2%. So   about a 2% difference.The studies that found these, though, even though those   numbers go back to the 1920s; it wasn't really until the 1970s   that people began to pick up on this. Then small-cap investing   became popular and then from like the early 1980s to the late   1990s small caps significantly underperformed large-cap   stocks.In fact, some people like Jeremy Siegel think that there is no   outperformance of small-cap stocks. It's due to a couple of   periods like the 1970s when small caps did particularly well. Not   everyone agrees with that. If you look over the last, say, 15   years small caps have outperformed, but over the last five years,   large caps have outperformed.The main point is that we don't really know what the future   will look like. For someone like you, I think it just makes sense   to have an equal allocation to large, midcaps, and small caps,   because we don't know what the future is going to look like.One issue is that the smaller you get, the more volatile the   stocks do become but because you're young, that's OK. If you're   talking about [I think you said it was your mother-in-law], I   think it makes more sense to lean toward large-cap stocks.   They're less volatile, but more of those companies are more   likely to be paying dividends, which I think makes sense.   Dividend-paying stocks generally tend to be less volatile, but   also once you're retired, it's nice to get that income. Hartzell:    And I would just say for anybody looking at small caps -- I don't   know if we define that all the time for folks -- generally we   look at stocks under $2 billion market cap and then things above   $10 billion are generally large-cap stocks. Brokamp:    And he is right when you look at the typical target retirement   fund.   Morningstar     does this report where they examine all the target   retirement funds -- the recent ones. They looked at 49 series of   funds, and they do find that generally speaking, those funds have   about two-thirds of their allocation to large caps and only   one-third to mid and small caps. I have to say I don't know   exactly why they do that. I think it makes more sense to have a   more evenly distributed portfolio allocation across all of those   sizes. Southwick:    Did you offer up any percentages, or no? Brokamp:    Equal. Southwick:    But what about bonds, though? Brokamp:    We'll talk about bonds later. Southwick:    OK, well, sorry! Brokamp:    It's just looking at stocks. Southwick:    Everyone, stay tuned! We're going to talk about bonds later. But   if you're looking at just the equity slice of your   portfolio... Brokamp:    I think you can go one-third small, one-third mid, one-third   large. Southwick:    The next question comes from Jim. "Now that   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL)  is a trillion-dollar corporation, I started   digging into how much of it I actually own. When I first started   with The Motley Fool, I began building out my Roth IRA and   Stock Advisor    picks, which included Apple as one of my first Starter Stocks,   but it's also the top holding in the index fund in my 401(k) and   it's also in a couple of other mutual funds I own. Should I sell   my small position in Apple that lives in my Roth to be able to   reinvest those funds into another stock that has greater   potential to grow? How many Apples is too many Apples?" Hartzell:    A good question, Jim! First of all, congratulations for actually   looking. A lot of people who own mutual funds don't understand   the concentrations of the funds and there's overlapping kinds of   concentrations that can build up. Apple's an obvious one if you   own ETFs or mutual funds. They're in just about everything   because they're so big and so liquid.I looked yesterday.   Vanguard    , if you own the S&P 500; about 4.19% of that mutual fund is   in Apple. And then, of course, if you own it in your own   portfolios as an individual stock, as well, you can easily get a   big percentage that you didn't really know about. So good for   checking. If you haven't checked, Morningstar has a cute, little   tool. It's called Instant X-Ray or Portfolio X-Ray. Just google   "Morningstar" and "X-Ray Tool." You can put in your mutual funds   and your individual stocks, and then you can see the overlapping   percentages of everything.So whether you should sell it or not; the nice thing is you   have this individual position in a Roth, so you don't have any   tax consequences for selling it or not. I'd say that's an   individual decision based on what percent you have in there. You   didn't tell us that, Jim, but I'd say generally around 10% gets   around the high side where you might feel a little bit   uncomfortable having that much allocated to it. Like you said,   there's no consequences to selling it, so that's fine.Generally we tell people, though, if you like the company and   how well they're performing, don't sell just for the sake of   selling, but that 10% is a rough area where you might get   uncomfortable. Southwick:    The next question comes from Michael. "I've read some convincing   arguments, recently [including on   Fool.com    ], that have suggested that the flood of investors' money going   into passively managed funds has the potential to create an index   bubble. This money is being unevenly distributed to the   top-performing large-cap stocks," [oh, hey there, Apple]. "If   those few companies were to falter, it would cause a cascading   effect downstream to smaller companies. Do you see any truth in   this assessment?" Brokamp:    It's a really interesting question! When you say the term "index   bubble," that has different meanings for different people. What   people are arguing is that indexing has done so well and become   so popular that it won't do as well in the future, and that in   the future actively managed funds will have an easier time of   it.I'm not sure if I agree with that or not. The long-term   history shows it's very tough to beat an index fund. That said,   what I think is more important [and it's more related to the   previous question] is the more your portfolio is allocated to   like an S&P 500 index fund, the more you are concentrating   your portfolio in a handful of stocks. And particularly at this   time, right now [more than 20% of] the S&P 500 is in   technology stocks. The No. 1 holding is Apple and No. 2 is   Microsoft    .   Google    is in the top 10. You have a pretty big concentration in one   sector.So I think it makes more sense just to look at your index   funds as part of your whole portfolio rather than just getting   away from index funds just because they're index funds. I know   Buck has an opinion about this, too, because we sit next to each   other and we talk about index funds all the time, partially   because we're both on the 401(k) committee and the Total Stock   Market Index Fund is the biggest holding in our 401(k). Hartzell:    That's right and we used to have the S&P 500. We switched   over to the Total Stock Market Index just because that does have   exposure to smaller and midcap companies, so somebody who wants   diverse exposure to the stock market should get all ranges.   That's why we did that.But I think it's a great question and I would say in addition   to the indexing, there's something that we talk about quite a bit   around here and that's "closet indexing." There are those   professional money managers who are scared to deviate much from   the performance in the index, so although they charge higher fees   than what you get from an index fund, they tend to have a large   overlap in the holdings of those index funds.I think there's probably even more support for some of that   momentum around those stocks, and one of the things that we get a   little worried about around here sometimes is that there's   largely a handful of stocks that are driving the performance of   that index. And when you get too concentrated [this happened in   the late 1990s], you had companies like   GE    and some of the large-cap [   Home Depot     was one of them and Lucent was a big driver]... Brokamp: Cisco    . Hartzell:    ... and Cisco was over a $500 billion company. When they make up   a big proportion of this whole index, you get a little worried if   something happens and they're all in that same sector. That gets   back to your sector comment too, Bro. We worry not just about the   index, but some of those people, and there's a lot of them   because they've underperformed and finally they give in and go,   "I can't underperform anymore, so I'm just going to add some of   these stocks." There's a big follow-on, ripple effect from that   indexing that's been going on. Southwick:    The next question comes from Ronald and he writes, "How and who   established the traditional metrics that we use for valuation and   why has that changed over time? Why are different industries and   businesses being evaluated with different valuation metrics vs.   other traditional metrics? For example, 20x forward earnings   being cheap vs. expensive for different businesses and   industries?" Hartzell:    Ronald, that's a little question, and it's pretty concise. Southwick:    The answer? Hartzell:    The answer is a big one! Brokamp:    [Laughs] So settle in, everybody. Hartzell:    See, I don't get in trouble. I'm just a guest here, so if you   guys don't like the depth that we're going into in this answer,   then you can tell them and they won't have me back again, which   is fine. Southwick:    I'm going to get comfy. Hartzell:    But the short answer is some industries are inherently better   than others, so that's the quick answer. Cereals, for instance.   Cereal companies have earned 15% return on equity for a long   period of time. They have competing products and that's just been   a really good industry. There's other industries like airlines   that typically -- they've done better recently -- that nobody   earns great returns with the exception of maybe   Southwest    or one or two airlines. So some industries are particularly good   and some are particularly bad, generally.Now the longer answer, as to multiples and valuation of   stocks, is a more complex thought, but I think it's important and   it's pretty timely. It's understanding the relationship between   inflation rates, interest rates, bond prices, and stock prices.   We're going to take a little dive into that and hopefully it's   useful to you.Interest rates are driven a lot by inflation. The inflation   rate [and I looked this up yesterday] is running about 2.3%. It's   pretty low and it's been modest here for quite some time. So   that's the inflation rate. And what happens when banks set   interest rates for different loans and things like that, they're   going to have to charge above the inflation rate or they lose   money. So typically banks will charge about 3% premium to   whatever inflation is. So if you see inflation is 2.3% you can   expect that loans and stuff like that will be at about 5% or   so.That interest rate, in turn, influences bond rates. I looked   at bond rates and we're at a weird time, here. We'll get back   into this later. I looked at T-bills. 10 year T-bills are at   about 3.14% right now, so on a $1,000 bond you would be getting   $31 a year in interest and that's a 10-year. If you look at 30   years, you only get 3.4%, so there's not a huge premium for that   extra 20 years. That's a little bit weird. We won't talk about   the yield curve, but those are bond rates. They're not   spectacular and they're certainly not a way to get rich right now   at 3% for T-bills.Then we look at stocks and multiples. Right now the S&P   500 is trading just below 18x earnings if you look at the S&P   500. Now, we compare those. Here's why it's important between   stocks and bonds. Bonds are a replacement for stocks. They   compete for money. So if you can get 6.5% guaranteed out of a   bond, you assume more risk when you buy stocks, because if   something goes bad [Sears shareholders out there], there's   nothing left for the equity holders, but the bond holders precede   them so they get preferential treatment. If you're going to take   that risk for being an equity holder, you want to earn more than   the bonds. As bond rates go up, then equities become less   attractive.So at 18x earnings, when we look at the S&P 500 multiple   to compare those two, we need to convert it to an earnings yield.   That's just the inverse. So if you have P/E of 10, one divided by   10 would be a 10% earnings yield. We have 17.98% which turns out   to be a 5% earnings yield on the S&P 500.Now here's the interesting thing. If you buy a bond, it   doesn't change. You're going to get that coupon and that's what   you get until it matures and it goes to the end. Brokamp:    That's what I call fixed income, because it's fixed. Hartzell:    Right, it's fixed. You get no growth. But when you invest in   stocks, earnings generally grow. On average they grow about 7% a   year if you look back historically. So what happens is investors   typically will take a little bit less on the earnings yield for   stocks than they will in comparison to bonds. Now here's the   weird thing today we're getting at and why it's important.We have a 5.6% earnings yield for the S&P 500 and we have   3% in bonds. That's weird. Usually it would be a discount, and   the discount would be if you took the rate for stocks and grew it   at 7% a year, usually it's about a three-year period there. So we   would expect that stocks would be cheaper. Unfortunately they're   not. You're getting more for stocks.So what does this tell us, that 5.6%? It tells us we should be   kind of leery of investing a whole lot of money right now in   bonds. Some people, Warren Buffett and others, have talked about   the big bond bubble and all of that, so as a result I would be   pretty skeptical of putting a whole lot of money in bonds today.   And most of the people that have to put it in [like insurers and   those kinds of companies], are in very short yielding. They're in   short-duration bonds. They're not going to buy that 30-year for   3.4% vs. a 10-year for 3.1%, and they're probably a much shorter   maturity than that.So in summary, here's what we know. Inflation impacts interest   rates, interest rates impact bond rates, and bond prices impact   stocks. So what happens when interest rates rise [and what we're   seeing with the Fed right now is they're raising rates, and   there's some signs that wages are growing that are traditional   inflationary signs, so we'd expect them to keep rising] the   current prices of bonds go down when rates go up. Because if you   bought a bond a day ago at a 3% and now it's 4%, well, the old   bond has to be repriced to be comparable to that 4%, so the price   of it goes down.Now if you hold it to maturity, that doesn't matter. You're   going to get your payments, and that's why Bro tells people to   ladder into bonds. Stocks, as well, when interest rates rise, the   multiples generally go down. But when we look out right now --   and this is why it gets scary -- is people go, "Stocks look   expensive to me from a historical standpoint." Well, you have to   compare it to something. There has to be some relative   comparison. And right now stocks in comparison to bonds look very   attractive. Southwick:    So, hey, let's keep talking about bonds. The next question comes   to us from Guy Over There. "If I understand the general   suggestions around preparing for a goal like retirement or   college, the idea is that the closer you get to needing the   money, the more you should be moving it from stocks to bonds and   cash. However, an article in   The New York Times     has scared the bejesus out of me."The article titled,   The Big, Dangerous Bubble in Corporate Debt    , by William Cohan, makes it sound like there are a lot of mutual   funds that have riskier corporate debt than one might assume. So   if I wanted to liquidate some of my shares out of these bond   funds to pay for college in a couple of years, I run the risk   that the bond prices, and thus my mutual fund values, might be   depressed just as I need to sell. What's your take on this? Do we   all have a lot more risk in our bond funds than we might think?"   Dun dun duuuun! Brokamp:    Dun dun Duuuun! I'll just piggyback on what Buck said. Clearly   there is more risk in the bond market these days when you have   rising interest rates and we've seen that this year so far. For   example, the aggregate bond index -- this index started in 1976   -- is on track to having its second worst year ever. And what   does that mean? It's down 2.5%. So it's not a huge decline, but   if you are saving for retirement, or if your retirement's coming   up, or you have college coming up, you don't want to see your   so-called safe money go down any kind of value.He also raises a point in that there are some questions about   the make-up of some bond funds, now in that they are getting   riskier. For example, one stat that I read in a   Business Insider    article was that when you look at investment-grade bonds, those   are rated BBB and above, and that's what most bond funds are.   They're investment grade. But if you look at the aggregate bond   index, 50% of those bonds are rated BBB, so basically right above   junk as opposed to just 38% right before the Great Recession. So   there is something to be said that the average bond fund is   riskier these days, just because it ends up holding more bonds   with lower ratings, so I think it's a valid point.The bottom line for me is again to what Buck said. These days   bonds are very unattractive. If you need to keep money out of the   stock market, especially if you want to keep it very safe, I   think cash is really the best way to go. And the good thing about   that, nowadays, as we've said before on previous episodes, is   that when the Fed hikes interest rates, you can almost see it   immediately in a good savings account or in CD rates.You have to look because a lot of banks and brokerages are   still paying virtually nothing. Counting on everybody being lazy   and not going out there and looking for better rates. But if you   go out you will find you will be able to earn more than 2% --   almost 3% -- on your cash, and I think that's more attractive for   money that you absolutely need to keep safe than a bond fund   these days. Hartzell:    You've got to consider the risks and rewards, and I think right   now you're not being paid a whole lot of reward for taking on   that risk, so I would be in cash, too. I own no bonds, but even   with college stuff and things, if you've saved $100,000 the   upside is maybe you eke out an extra percent or so. That's   $1,000. That's not going to make the difference on whether they   go to college or not, so I wouldn't take the risk with money that   I knew I needed in the next two or three years. Brokamp:    I'm not saying you shouldn't own bonds, by the way. If you have a   long-term portfolio and you don't want to have all of your money   in stocks, I think a diversified bond fund can still make sense.   Just as long as you know the risks, I think over a span of five   to 10 years, studies have shown that rates going up over the   intermediate to longer term is actually good for a bond fund,   because the new bonds that they buy have [higher] interest rates.   So I think you can still earn more than cash over the long term   but stick with cash if you want something that's absolutely   safe. Southwick:    The next question comes from Harpreet. "I have a question about   how stock prices of U.S. tech companies [especially the FANG   stocks] might get impacted in the scenario of the U.S. dollar   weakening and losing its reserve currency status. Do you think   this is possible?" Hartzell:    The short answer is anything is possible, but I think you're   probably worrying a little bit too much. For those of you out   there with reserve currency questions, the US is the world's   reserve currency, which means other governments keep a lot of our   money. You may have some insights that I don't. We have people   here in Washington who work in the Federal Reserve. I just don't   see that changing. That's not anything that I ever lose sleep   over at night.We're a bottoms-up kind of investment shop here for how we   look at investment companies and stocks to invest in. I put   almost no thought into what's going to happen to   Netflix    (NASDAQ: NFLX)  or   Facebook     if the U.S. dollar is not the world's reserve currency. I'm   not worried about it. I don't even think about it that much and I   don't think it's going to have that much bearing on any of those   companies. If you like the companies and they're doing well hold   them. Don't worry so much about the reserve currency. Southwick:    The next question comes from... Oh! It's another Allison, but   this one has two Ls, and she's in Florida. "How much should I   have in international stocks? I think the frequently accepted   recommendation is about 30-40% of a portfolio or even up to 50%,   but this week there was a long and heated thread on the   Bogleheads" -- they're always heated on the Bogleheads Forum,   aren't they -- "challenging this. The title of the thread was,   'It's not enough to mumble Stay the Course. Int'l investing has   been a disaster!' Would you be able to comment on this?" Brokamp:    First of all let's start, because this was playing off the   Bogleheads Forum, with what Jack Bogle says. I just recently   heard an interview. The Bogleheads conference happened recently   and he made some comments about international investing. He's one   of those people that says it's not really necessary. When you   look at the long-term returns of U.S. vs. international, there's   no evidence that international outperforms U.S. over the long   term. Plus the U.S. is a more stable country. We have a pretty   good, highly regulated securities market, so you don't have to   worry quite so much about fraud. Plus around 40% of the revenues   from companies in the S&P 500 come from overseas ventures, so   you're still getting some international diversification   there.So if you're going to go with Jack Bogle -- and it's hard to   argue too much with Jack Bogle -- just stick with U.S. stocks.   That said, when he was running Vanguard and he has since retired,   they had international funds and they still have international   funds. One of the reasons are there are time periods when   international stocks outperform U.S. It happened in the 1980s. It   happened in a good part of the 1970s. It happened in the first   decade of the 2000s.Jason Zweig in The Wall Street Journal wrote an article   saying, "It's pretty tough, now, from a valuation standpoint, to   ignore international stocks. They're about half the valuation of   U.S. stocks." Of course, we've been saying this for years and   international stocks still, other than in 2017, have   underperformed U.S. stocks over the last five years or so.I would say you have to be comfortable with the volatility of   international stocks. I have about 20-25% of my 401(k) in   international stocks, but you don't have to have it. One thing I   will say is the way that was phrased on the Bogleheads is that   international investing has been a disaster. It's not really been   a disaster. Over the long term international stocks have   underperformed U.S. stocks a little bit, but it really depends on   what time period you're looking at. Hartzell:    And I would add if you're buying individual stocks there can be   some extra trading costs from some of your brokerages when you   buy international companies. I work mostly on Canadian   operations, so I have ideas through all our services. I'd say   that's an easy market because it's pretty familiar with us. It's   right across the border. There's other ones where there's unique   things in accounting that are a little bit different and more   difficult to comprehend.So I would say I don't think you need to, but if you have an   interest and you want to find great companies, why would you not   look everywhere for those? But you don't have to. You can do very   well.   Berkshire Hathaway    (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) and Warren Buffett have very little   of their capital [in international stocks and] they're trying to   buy more international companies and he's been trying for years.   He's done pretty well with mostly sticking to the U.S.   market. Southwick:    Speaking of Berkshire Hathaway and Buffett, our next question   comes from Evandro who's in São Paulo, Brazil. "What will happen   to Berkshire Hathaway stocks the day Buffett announces his   retirement? He's 88, so it's possible it could happen soon. I   have no issues with him continuing to lead the company, but for   natural reasons we tend to think about his eventual retirement.   It would be great to hear what you think." Hartzell:    It's a great question. I was at the Berkshire meeting this May   and it's just amazing when you see him. You mentioned Warren   Buffett up there at 88 and taking questions for six hours from   40,000-50,000 people. And Charlie Munger, his sidekick and vice   chairman is 94. Southwick:    Wow! And still mentally sharp, right? Hartzell:    Amazing! Amazingly sharp and still eats about a box or two of   peanut brittle and drinks Cherry   Coke    the whole time. So much for your doctor's orders of eating   healthy and longevity. But the great thing about Berkshire -- and   I've owned it for a long time -- is I remember reading this   question on our discussion boards in the 1990s. "Buffet's   70-something years old." Brokamp:    I remember that, too! Hartzell:    Now we're getting it 20 years [later]. Here's what I would say. I   would be surprised if Berkshire stock went up when Warren Buffett   steps down. It's probably going to go down. But then, again, this   is his baby. He's built this thing. There are some things that   are very unique about Berkshire Hathaway.First of all, they have a wonderful bench strength of managers   and they have a decentralized organizational structure, so   although they own 80-plus businesses, they're all run by their   own entrepreneurs and great people, and Buffett has no real   insight into those businesses. He understands what's going on --   he gets the numbers -- but they run those day-to-day. He does   not. All he really does is capital allocation and management.The capital allocation stuff, he's hired a couple of really   good folks to do that. Todd Combs and Ted Weschler are helping   out on that, and he's got same great people in the insurance   operations with Ajit Jain. Greg Abel will take over some of the   other operations for their management of oversight and the   management duties of Berkshire. So he has great people, there,   and my guess is if you're anticipating that the stock's going to   get crushed, that's probably not going to happen. They have lots   of capital, and I'm sure that the people who are taking over the   reins from Warren will have free rein to buy back stock, at will,   if it reaches a certain price.I'm waiting for that day. It's probably not going to come. The   day will come when he'll step aside, but the price probably won't   be on sale as much as you think. I wouldn't worry so much about   that. Brokamp:    I've also owned it for several years -- although I'm sure not as   long as you --but like you, I don't have the same concerns.   Buffett has shown an ability to invest in good businesses, and he   has also shown the ability to invest in good people. Those people   will still be there after he retires. Hartzell:    And they have $100 billion in cash. There's not many companies on   Earth that have the balance sheet strength that Berkshire   Hathaway has right now, and we know that they are willing to   allocate it very quickly. I think he bought almost $40 billion of   Apple in the last year or so. He'll put it to work when he finds   ideas. Brokamp:    Another example of how you could possible own more Apple than you   think you do. Hartzell:    Yes, through Berkshire. That's right. Southwick:    The next question comes from Morrell? Morel? I'm not quite sure   how to pronounce it. Brokamp:    One of those. Southwick:    I'll pronounce it many ways. "My wife and I are 26 and 28   respectively. I just started a new job with what I feel is great   pay and I'm trying to start good savings and investing habits.   I'm getting aggravated because there are too many goals to hit."   Are you ready? Brokamp:    Ready! Southwick:    "First goal: need three-to-six months' worth of income and   savings for emergency fund, so a goal of $18,000. We currently   have $10,000 saved. Need [10%] for down payment on a car; $4,500   for a $45,000 car. Need a 20% down payment for a house to avoid   PMI; $40,000 for a $200,000 home. Continue savings for baby   expenses. It seems that all my savings energy is going to   amassing a minimum of $52,500 savings account just to meet the   basics. How in the world will we ever be able to invest? My wife   and I both contribute minimum to match amounts to our 401(k)s,   but we are nowhere near maxing out those accounts much less a   Roth IRA or brokerage account. I feel we are decent stewards of   our money but it just seems like an impossible task to hit   savings goals while investing at the same time. Any help would be   amazing." Aw! Brokamp:    Such sympathy... Southwick:    Well, it's so much stress. Brokamp:    I know. Southwick:    You're doing great! Brokamp:    I'm sure you're doing great! First of all, you care about this   and you're in your mid-20s, which is great sign. And it's   certainly difficult to hit all these targets when you're just   starting out and you're thinking of starting a family.Here are my initial thoughts. You said three-to-six months of   income in a saving-for- emergency fund. As I've mentioned in   previous episodes, I don't think it's three-to-six months of   income. It's about three months of must-pay expenses. You don't   have a mortgage at this point. You don't have kids at this point.   I think you can get by with a smaller emergency fund. You've   already saved up $10,000. That's probably OK, especially if you   feel like your jobs are pretty safe.The $4,500 to put a down payment on a $45,000 car. I would say   lower your car needs. I don't know what car you're looking at,   but you can get a pretty good used car. Almost every car I've   bought is a used car. Southwick:    We just bought a $16,000 new car and it's delightful. I don't   care if it's a manual transmission. That's our best theft   deterrent -- the fact that our car is a manual transmission. Brokamp:    Not to mention you can pop the clutch if the battery goes dead.   Anyway, so I would say lower your sights in what kind of car you   need. Hartzell:    The average new car now -- I did this quiz with my family last   night -- is $36,000. That's the average price, and largely   because they're not making little cars anymore, very much, and   they've all gone to the more profitable SUVs, and that's driven   up the average cost, but $45,000 is probably for a nice SUV. Brokamp:    And then a 20% down payment to avoid PMI. I understand how   difficult that could be. If you're doing it for a $200,000 home   I'm jealous because we live in the Washington, D.C. area and you   could never find a home for that amount. I would say, especially   with your first home, it's OK to put down less than 20%. Southwick:    We did the FHA loan. That was 4%. Brokamp:    And you can get out of PMI once you have built up 20% equity, so   the combination of you making your payments and hopefully the   home price increase means eventually you can get out of PMI, so   you generally don't have to pay it forever. Just make sure you   know what the terms are before you take on that loan. Southwick:    Also, you don't have to buy a house if you don't want to. Brokamp:    That's another big thing. We've talked about that. Home ownership   is completely overrated. It's the biggest mistake my wife and I   made that we've bought too many houses; partially because we   bought the so-called starter home and didn't think down the line   to how many kids we eventually would have. So if you're at a   point where you're just starting this job and you're not sure   whether you're going to like it or not, and you don't know how   many kids you're going to have, you might want to wait on buying   the house. Hartzell:    We see some house prices moderating. There's not a whole lot of   inventory right now in most markets, and as more inventory comes   on, it usually benefits the buyer, too. So patience, sometimes.   I'll echo what Bro said. You're in your mid-20s. You're doing   phenomenally well. Just prioritize things.I would add one that Bro won't like, and we sit on the   retirement committee here, but I remember we did it for our first   house. We borrowed from our 401(k) to make our down payment for   our first house. That's not your first option, but you guys are   contributing to 401(k)s, so that is an option. And make sure that   when you do buy that house that you want to be in that area for   seven years, at least, because it's not something you want to do   -- buy and sell houses. There's commissions that go along with   those and usually around 6%, so it's much more expensive to buy   and sell houses than it is stocks or anything else, so make sure   that when you do buy, you make that commitment. Southwick:    Like the schools and those things. That's a big deal in our   area. Hartzell:    Go visit that house and do the early morning commute and do the   commute back at nighttime, as well. And one thing for those of   you, since it's not a house show... Southwick:    Oh, I'm all houses all the time. Hartzell:    Oh, you're all houses. That's right. Southwick:    We're closing this Friday. Hartzell:    Alison is closing, but look for comparable rentals to your house,   and generally you want to pay around 200x a comparable monthly   rent. It will fluctuate, but around there is pretty good. In the   peak bubble times of 2005-2007 around here, people were paying up   to 400x monthly rents, and those people generally saw the value   of their house decline by 30-40%. Then you're underwater and   that's a bad situation to be in. So that's a good tip when you   start to value what you should pay for a house. Brokamp:    And since this episode comes out right before Halloween, if   you're going to have kids, it's a great time to drive around and   see which neighbor has the most little kids walking around. Who's   decorating the most for Halloween to get that vibe. Southwick:    That's true! Brokamp:    The final thing I'll say is if you can manage to save more money,   the first place I'd put it is the Roth IRA because that money   grows tax-free and as we've pointed out previously, the money you   put into a Roth IRA you can take out tax and penalty-free if you   need it. I wrote an article back when my kids were very young   about us using a Roth IRA as an emergency fund. We put it in   there. Hopefully we don't need to touch it, but if we did need to   get it we could. We didn't need to, but we did look at that as   our emergency fund and it worked out pretty well. Southwick:    So they could put that $10,000 that they currently have saved and   shuffle it over to the Roth. Hartzell:    The contributions you can take out tax-free. Brokamp:    Right, not the earnings. And the limit per person is $5,500 for   folks their age, although hopefully it's going to go up in   2019. Southwick:    The bottom line is you're doing great! Brokamp:    You're doing great! Southwick:    And you are investing! You're just investing in a lot of   stuff! Hartzell:    That's right! Southwick:    The next question comes from Dr. YL. "My biggest holding is   Netflix, which became 40-50% in my main portfolio. This is a   taxable account. The recent pullback in the stock's price hurt   this account substantially. Since I started investing, I've made   nearly 200 buy orders and fewer than 10 sell orders. Overall I'm   very happy with this Fool approach of buying, holding, and not   selling; but, maybe it's time to stream some Netflix into other   stocks." Hartzell:    Wow, I like that! First of all, congratulations! Southwick:    It's a nice problem to have! Hartzell:    We generally tell people to buy in thirds, which means whatever   your full position is, you take one bite and one-third of that   and then two more purchases, so you give yourself some time. You   did it in 200s, so that's awesome, and he added to a great stock   and he's made a lot of money. So first of all, congratulations   for that!We call it the "sleep well at night" test. Here's the thing. I   think Netflix is doing very well. I'm not the expert analyst on   covering it, but I think most of their potential is in the rest   of the world, now, because they've gotten so much penetration,   here, in the US. They've shown great progress in being an   attractive offering around the world. That's great for   Netflix.But stocks are volatile from time to time, and if a 20-30%   pullback in Netflix impacts your life, and it sounds like the   recent pullback was less than that and maybe shook you a little   bit, it's fine to sell some of that. I think it's in a taxable   account, so you're going to have to pay some taxes, but there's   worse things to do than pay taxes. Once in a while we've got to   do that. I would say a 10% range I start to get a little bit   uncomfortable, maybe. That's a personal thing. 40 and 50%; if you   have a 20% drop in that, that hits your portfolio at 10%, it's a   pretty big hit.So I think you're wise to be thinking that maybe this is a   little bit uncomfortable and you can take some out. Another great   way to do this without paying taxes is if you're currently saving   and adding money to your savings is to rebalance with new money   by buying other things.That way you don't have to sell your Netflix. You can just buy   some of the other positions that you like and that percentage of   your portfolio will naturally go down; unless, of course, the   stock does wonderfully well. Those are two options. You can do   both of them. Don't add any money to Netflix. You can just add   money to other things and then if you feel like, you can sell it   down a little bit. Brokamp:    Yes. The stock is down 20% since June. There have been times in   Netflix's history where it's been down more than 70%. Southwick:    Qwikster. Brokamp:    Yes, so it's definitely a concern I would have. The tax   consequences are unfortunate, or fortunate. It's always better to   pay capital gains taxes than to take capital losses. But if you   have made multiple purchases over your history of holding it, you   can determine which shares you're selling, and choose the cost   basis that is best for your situation.To be quite honest, given that tax rates are pretty low [not   knowing your particular situation], it might be a good time to   take the big gain now if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket   in the future or if you expect tax rates to go up in the future   to find some way to pay for Social Security and Medicare and all   that stuff. I'm not saying that you should necessarily choose the   highest-basis shares. You might want to choose the lowest-basis   shares and bite that bullet today. It depends on your tax   situation, but basically you do have a little bit of control over   that. Hartzell:    And to the extent that if you do sell some of that, you can look   through your portfolio for some offsetting losses to cancel out   some of those gains and balance them out. I don't know if you   have that or not, but that's always a good thing to do at the end   of every year, anyhow. Some tax-loss selling. You can buy them   back in... Brokamp:    30 days. Hartzell:    ... plus 30 days and do that if you want but, anyhow, that's   something else to consider.[...] Southwick:    That's it from those questions. Now it's time to move on to my   favorite part of the mailbag episode... Brokamp:    Moving tips. Southwick:    No, I've gotten one moving tip, so far. That was it! Hartzell:    I've got one. Don't do it yourself! Southwick:    Yeah, that is a good one! That is a very good one! We are   listening to that one. One person, so far, has sent one in, but   I'm hoping more people will send in their moving, buying, and   selling a house advice. There's only one person that sent one in.   I'll share it later, and I've got some more advice from around   The Fool. That's coming later.My favorite part is where you guys send us postcards and talk   about them. So first off -- Buck, you're going to be a little bit   in the dark, here, but we're going to talk about how divisive our   Financial Independence/ Retire Early episode was. On Twitter,   [Harand] was intrigued and felt inspired by the episode, and   Dylan, here at The Fool, he gave us extra gold for it. Brokamp:    He did. Southwick:    He said it was a great episode! However, a couple of people, or   maybe more than a couple, had some concerns. Raj writes, "I've   always found these type of self-help stories are misleading.   Typically these folks publicize that they achieved their freedom   beforehand, and now simply run the website to share knowledge out   of the goodness of their heart, but it's misleading."More often than not, the fact is these folks can quit their   jobs because of their online businesses. There's nothing wrong   with that. It's just hard to take any of their stories credibly.   Their advice generally makes sense. I would love it if you guys   have guests on the show who are true FIs. Who have achieved their   FI the Foolish way [financial independence] and now pursue their   passions: travel, community services, arts, hobbies, education,   going back to school, volunteering, etc., without running online   businesses. It would be really interesting to hear those stories   on how they achieved financial independence and how they handle   their finances during pseudo-retirement."Sam also wrote in and found some suggestions made by the   guests about financial independence and self-reliance were more   about getting public support and had concerns about that [relying   on public support], such as getting subsidies for healthcare and   sending your kids to community college for the first few years.   Is that going to stunt their academic progress? I don't know if   you have any thoughts. Brokamp:    When these guys were able to leave jobs that they didn't like to   a life that they enjoy more, with more flexibility, because they   found some way to save 50-70% of their income; to me that is the   key lesson. At a time when the national savings rate is 6%, to   look at people who were like, "I want to change my circumstances   and I'm going to do it by saving a lot of money, ignoring the   consumer culture, and creating a life that I like more," that's   really, to me, the big story of these folks who want to retire in   their 30s and 40s by doing the FIRE thing. Southwick:    For our more seasoned listeners and investors who've been with   The Motley Fool for a long time, I think they already are frugal,   and I think they're, "Yeah, I've already been there and done   that. Now what I need to know is how can I really make more money   by investing and how can I really be financially independent and   stop making money, period, and just live off of what I've made."   But I think for the younger listeners on the show, the idea of,   "Oh, I can reject consumer culture," is probably quite   eye-opening. I think it probably says more about maybe the stage   of life that our listener is in... Brokamp:    Could be. Southwick:    ... and how they reacted to the episode. Hartzell:    I would add for running those businesses, this is what they love.   They enjoy doing it and here's the real secret. This is not about   journaling, but when you write about it and you teach other   people, you learn a lot more about the subject yourself. You get   comments from other people, so I'd say retirement means different   things to different people, and I'd hope if you're in your 30s   and 40s, it may mean you're working and you love working, but   just doing something that you really like. And you're probably   going to get a lot better at it, then, then doing other things.   Certainly watching TV or whatever else. Southwick:    For the record, we always appreciate your feedback on episodes   and when you disagree with us, that's really great and helpful to   hear. I can't do anything about my voice -- but it's still   helpful to hear from me -- nor can Bro. Sorry. Hartzell:    I can't either. Southwick:    This is what we've got. No, you've got a nice voice. I just want   to say congrats to listener Jason, who got engaged and sent in a   photo. He sent it in along with a question. We didn't get to your   question, but I felt like we should say congrats on getting   engaged.Rick is going to be bummed that he's sick today because I'm   mentioning [and I left it back on my desk], but our postcards. We   got one. You have to imagine it. It's three parts of an alligator   turned into three different postcards. It came from Clay in Saint   Augustine. He addressed the head to Bro, the gut to me, and the   tail to Rick, which I think seems exactly right. Brokamp:    How about the heart to you? You're the heart of the show! Southwick:    Thanks! The heart and the gut. Rich is like our own Uncle Matt   from   Fraggle Rock    . He's so prolific with sending in the postcards. He sent us   three postcards that his parents brought when they visited him in   New Mexico, so all three are from his home town in Ohio. We have   one of a leffel turbine, another of the courthouse, and a third   of an old Methodist Mission church.And [Tomoko] -- do you remember her? She came and visited The   Fool and shared her story. She lives in Old Town? Brokamp:    Oh, yeah! Southwick:    She sent a card from Iaqluit, which is way up north in Canada.   She says it's amazingly beautiful but cold. How cold you ask? Brokamp:    How cold? Southwick:    In October, on average, the high is negative one degree   Fahrenheit. Brokamp:    Ow, wow! Why? Southwick:    I don't know what [Tomoko] is doing up there, but I appreciate   her sending a postcard from a far-flung part of the world. So, I   think that's it! Buck, thank you for joining us! Hartzell:    Thanks for having me! I appreciate it, Alison and Robert! It was   fun! Southwick:    It's a joy! We try to have fun. The show, like I said, has been   taped by Austin. It's still probably going to get edited   nauseatingly by Rick Engdahl. Our email is      Answers@Fool.com    . For Robert Brokamp, I'm Alison Southwick. Stay Foolish   everybody.

Is Qualcomm Stock Ready for a Comeback?
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhen Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) reports its earnings after the market closes on Nov. 7, analysts are expecting ho-hum results. Earnings of 82 cents a share on revenues of $5.53 billion are roughly in line with the June numbers . There are hopes for 89 cents, but that's irrelevant to the investment case for QCOM stock.The investment case beyond the upcoming QCOM earnings report, is based on hopes that peace will break out. Peace with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will bring an enormous dividend because, as Qualcomm estimates, Apple is currently withholding $7 billion in royalties from it pending litigation.That's the equivalent of four months' revenue for Qualcomm, which does make communication chips but is best known for holding patent rights on key mobile technologies.How much Apple should pay for those rights is at the heart of the long-running dispute.Apple has been trying to break away from Qualcomm for years, signing Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) to make new modem chips, but it can't get any financial benefit from that because of QCOM's royalty rights over the technology. Even if it buys chips from Intel, it still must pay QCOM. Qualcomm's patent prices make that uneconomical.So, Apple is in court trying to call its patent rights "exhausted."  It's arguing that Qualcomm's patent rights are paid for once a product is purchased, as they would be after you buy a Lexmark toner cartridge for a printer.Apple has the Federal Trade Commission on its side in these arguments. Regulators want Qualcomm to license its technology on "Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory" (FRAND) terms , saying its patents give it a monopoly threatening innovation.Qualcomm responds that it has agreed not to sue over the patents at issue in the Apple case, and that renders any case against it moot.  The case is presently before U.S. Judge Gonzalo Curiel.The risk, for QCOM stock owners, is that courts and regulators could thus invalidate future royalty claims.Even without Apple on its side, however, Qualcomm has a bright future.For one thing, Qualcomm definitely has Amazon  (NASDAQ: AMZN ) on its side. Qualcomm chips are powering Alexa devices.For another thing, 5G is coming. Perhaps it's not coming as fast as Nokia (NYSE: NOK ) once hoped , but it is coming.Qualcomm is pushing a new version of WiFi called WiFi 6 , one it hopes will encourage people to upgrade both devices and routers, delivering speeds up to 10 GBits/second . And it has a new version of its flagship Snapdragon chip that will improve mobile devices' cameras and gameplay.It's a big lineup, as our James Brumley recently noted when he recently wrote about QCOM stock , and those benefits are not in QCOM stock due to the legal dispute.At its Nov. 5 opening price of about $63.33 per share, Qualcomm stock is selling for less than 18 times earnings, based on its anticipated third-quarter results. The market cap of $93 billion is less than five times its 2017 revenue, which in turn was held down by Apple's refusal to pay royalties.Qualcomm stock is presently selling at a discount to the S&P 500 and has one of the lowest P/E ratios in technology, mainly due to legal uncertainty.To keep excitement in QCOM stock high, Qualcomm has been low-balling its earnings estimates, so it can report solid beats on the bottom line. For the June quarter, for instance, the QCOM earnings report beat estimates by 30 cents per share.Bank of America  says don't buy Qualcomm stock , based on Apple's slowing smartphone growth, and the maturity of that market. But 12 of the 26 analysts following the stock still have it on their buy lists.The bottom line is that you can buy QCOM stock now or buy it later, but owning it is something of a no-brainer in a growth portfolio.Dana Blankenhorn  is a financial and technology journalist.

 By Stephen Nellis Nov 6 (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge ruled on Tuesday that chip seller Qualcomm Inc  must license some of its technology to competitors such as Intel Corp. The preliminary ruling came in an antitrust lawsuit against Qualcomm brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in early 2017. The lawsuit is scheduled to go to trial next year. Qualcomm and the FTC had jointly asked Koh last month to delay ruling on the issue for up to 30 days while they pursued settlement talks.  Koh denied that motion on Tuesday. It was not immediately clear whether the ruling would affect the settlement talks. Qualcomm shares were down about 0.3 percent to $63.26 after the news. Qualcomm did not immediately return a request for comment. The FTC and Intel declined to comment. Settling with U.S. regulators would be a turning point for the San Diego chip firm, which has been defending its business model amid lawsuits from large customers such as Apple Inc  and Huawei Technologies Inc, as well as dealing with regulatory challenges to its practices around the world. At issue in the civil litigation and regulatory disputes is whether Qualcomm's patent licensing practices, when combined with its chip business, constitute anticompetitive behavior. Regulators in South Korea and Taiwan initially ruled against Qualcomm, but it has appealed the rulings and settled some of them. In August, Qualcomm settled with Taiwanese regulators for $93 million and an agreement to invest $700 million in the country over the next five years.

  Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL) latest   iPhone XR    might not be the big seller that either the company or its   investors had hoped.According to a report from    Nikkei Asian Review     , Apple told contract manufacturers Foxconn and Pegatron "to halt   plans for additional production lines dedicated to the relatively   cost-effective model that hit shelves in late October."  Image source: Apple.It's not all bad news, though. According to the report, Apple   has boosted its orders for last year's iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus   by 5 million units to 25 million.Let's take a closer look at what might be going on.Apple's iPhone 8 starts at $599 for the 64 GB version and goes   to $749 for the 256 GB model. The larger version, called the   iPhone 8 Plus, begins at $699 and goes to $849 for those same   configurations.By contrast, the iPhone XR comes in three storage   configurations: 64 GB, 128 GB, and 256 GB. These are priced at   $749, $799, and $899, respectively.Unsurprisingly, the iPhone XR is more expensive than either   the iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus at comparable storage configuration   -- it's the newer, flashier device. What's interesting, though,   is that the 256 GB version of the iPhone 8 is priced identically   to the 64 GB version of the iPhone XR and the 256 GB version of   the iPhone 8 Plus is   more    expensive than the 128 GB version of the iPhone XR and only   slightly less expensive than the 256 GB version of the   iPhone 8 Plus    .Different customers might value different things. So, for   example, someone who really values having as much storage space   as possible in their devices might be more interested in a $749   iPhone 8 with 256 GB of storage instead of paying that same   amount for the 64 GB iPhone XR.If a customer picks a $749 iPhone 8 over a $749 iPhone XR,   Apple's still getting the sale and the same amount of revenue.   It's hard to tell which product is more profitable for the   company, however, without knowing the cost structures of each   device.Here's the full quote from   Nikkei Asian Review    's source with respect to Apple's production demands:For the Foxconn side, it first prepared nearly 60 assembly     lines for Apple's XR model, but recently uses only around 45     production lines as its top customer said it does not need to     manufacture that many by now.This,   Nikkei Asian Review    added, means that Foxconn is set to "produce around 100,000 fewer   units daily to reflect the new demand outlook -- down 20% to 25%   from the original optimistic outlook."While it clearly would've been better for Apple if demand were   so high that it needed to use up all of the production lines that   Foxconn put into place, it's also important to keep in mind that   trying to forecast demand for a single iPhone model -- especially   when the portfolio is now quite broad, consisting of seven   distinct models in multiple storage configurations -- isn't   easy.Indeed, that Apple is reportedly not maxing out its iPhone XR   production capacity and actually having its partners produce more   of the older iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus is a good illustration of   that.I wouldn't be surprised, then, if Apple and Foxconn worked   together to put in some extra capacity to make sure that they   could quickly respond to upside in demand and they're simply   finding that they don't need to utilize it.With that said, it's still very possible that even if Apple   and Foxconn had put in some extra production capacity that demand   for the iPhone XR still isn't as robust as Apple had expected.   It's hard to really know exactly what's going on unless Apple   itself were to share its detailed thinking publicly -- something   that's it's   extremely    unlikely to do.

The Dow and the S&P 500 climbed on Monday as energy, financials and defensive stocks rallied. Also, investors remained wary ahead of the U.S. midterm elections, scheduled on Tuesday, which could change the balance of power in Washington. Meanwhile, tech stocks once again weighed on the Nasdaq, with the index ending in negative territory.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) gained 0.8% to close at 25,461.70. The S&P 500 advanced 0.6% to close at 2,738.31. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,328.85, declining 0.4%. A total of 7.07 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 8.76 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.80-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.13-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.How did the Benchmark Perform?The Dow added 190.87 points, as shares of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B rallied helping the broader financial sector. Shares of Berkshire Hathaway jumped 4.7%. The 30-stock indexed was also helped by a rally in energy stocks, led by Chevron Corporation CVX . Shares of Chevron gained 3.7%. Chevron has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .The S&P 500 gained 15.25 points, with nine of the 11 major sectors ending the day in positive territory. The Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) and the Energy Service Select Sector SPDR (XLE) were the best performers, gaining 1.5% and 1.7%, respectively. However, tech stocks once again suffered, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and the Communication Service Select Sector SPDR (XLC) declining 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively.The tech-heavy Nasdaq, lost 28.14 points, with tech stocks taking a hit. Shares of Apple Inc. AAPL and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN declined 2.8% and 2.3%, respectively.Financials, Energy Stocks Help MarketsOn Monday, markets bounced back, helped by a rally in financial stocks. Shares of Berkshire Hathaway jumped after investor Warren Buffet's conglomerate shared over the weekend that it bought back almost $1 billion of its shares in August. This saw the broader financial sector gain heavily.Shares of Citigroup Inc. C and Bank of America Corporation BAC gained 2.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Also, the energy sector, which has lagged the broader S&P 500 index this year, gained on Monday, after the United States imposed a range of sanctions on Iran.Tech Stocks Weigh on MarketsTech stocks once again plummeted, with shares of Apple and Amazon once again taking a hit. On Friday shares of Apple declined, sending its market value below $1 trillion at the close, a day after the company warned sales for the all-important holiday quarter may lag expectations.Also, Amazon's shares fell after President Donald Trump said that the administration was looking into the antitrust violations committed by the company. This weighed on the broader technology sector, leading to selloffs.Markets Cautious Ahead of U.S. Midterm ElectionsInvestors also remained cautious ahead of the U.S. midterm elections, scheduled on Tuesday, which could change the balance of power in Washington. While Democrats are expected to regain control of the House, Republicans are likely to hold slim majority in the Senate. This outcome is widely seen as positive for markets given that U.S. stocks have gained during government gridlock.However, given the current situation, if Democrats gain majority in both the chambers, it could put stocks under pressure, as that could lead to reversal of some of the policies by the GOP to boost economy. On the other hand, if GOP gains majority in both chambers, it might help stocks, as that will increases the chances of further tax cuts. This saw investors trading cautiously on Monday.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

Tuesday’s Vital Data: Activision, Amarin and Apple
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. stock futures are trading lower as election day takes center stage. Speculation on the outcome is heading into overdrive, but the current consensus is for the Democrats to gain control of the House and split Congress. Ahead of the bell, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 0.11% and S&P 500 futures are lower by 0.14%. Nasdaq-100 futures have shed 0.22%.In the options pits, volume plunged yesterday as market volatility subsided. Specifically, about 15.7 million calls and 14.2 million puts changed hands on the session.The lack of urgency in put buying was apparent at the CBOE, where the single-session equity put/call volume fell to 0.61. The 10-day moving average held its ground at 0.67.Options activity was a mixed bag on Monday. Traders slammed shares of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI ) after its unveiling of its new "Diablo Immortal" mobile game had players in an uproar. Amarin  (NASDAQ: AMRN ) options were active ahead of their Nov. 10 release of additional details on their fish-oil-based drug, Vascepa. Finally, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) fell on reports that it halted plans to increase production following disappointing demand for the iPhone XR.Let's take a closer look:Activision Blizzard shares slid 7% Monday following outrage as players learned its new "Diablo Immortal" game would be released on mobile devices only and not PC. This was not what its hardcore fanbase was expecting and resulted in a flurry of negative comments across social media channels.The selling pressure comes as investors gear up for earnings Thursday night. ATVI stock is now down 31% since peaking early last month at $84.68.On the options trading front, calls traded heavy on the day. Activity swelled to 254% of the average daily volume, with 69,736 total contracts traded. 78% of the trading came from call options alone.With earnings coming around the corner, implied volatility is understandably lofty. At 52%, the implied vol sits at the 100th percentile of the one-year range. The market is pricing in a $4.50 move for Activision's earnings reaction which translates into a 7% jump.Irish biotech company, Amarin saw a flood of call demand on continued speculation over the potential for its fish oil-based drug, Vascepa. September's release of positive results surrounding the drug's ability to treat high triglyceride levels is what placed AMRN stock on the map with an overnight pole vault from $3 to $12.Since then, the stock has continued its moonshot, and many traders are taking to the options market to place their bets.On the options trading front, calls were the hot ticket. Activity ramped to 146% of the average daily volume, with 68,378 total contracts traded. An impressive 86% of the tally came from calls.Though implied volatility imploded after the company's September release of the study results, it remains extremely high at 181%. On Nov. 10 Amarin is expected to release further information from its study at the 2018 Scientific Sessions of the American Heart Association. Look for its next outsized gap to strike then.Apple landed atop our "most-actives" list again yesterday. The latest negative news for the tech titan arrived via the Nikkei Asian Review which reported: "Apple has signaled disappointing demand for the new iPhone XR, telling its top smartphone assemblers Foxconn and Pegatron to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to the relatively cost-effective model that hit shelves in late October, sources say."AAPL shares fell as much as 4.2% before paring losses into the closing bell. Combined with the earnings swoon, the stock has been taken out at the knees.On the options trading front, calls slightly outpaced puts on the day. Activity remained elevated at 144% of the average daily volume, with 898,215 total contracts traded. Calls accounted for 58% of the day's take.Implied volatility remains aloft at 32% or the 61st percentile of its one-year range. The market is pricing in daily moves of 2%.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold positions in any of the aforementioned securities. Want insightful education on how to trade?

 Starting with the iPhone 7 series of smartphones, chip giant   Intel    (NASDAQ: INTC) has been supplying LTE modems to   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) in support of its all-important iPhone product   line. Being the sole supplier of modems for Apple's latest iPhone   XS, XS Max, and XR smartphones led Intel's modem business to pop   131% last quarter    .Now, according to a new report from   Fast Company    , Apple will source 5G modems exclusively from Intel for its 2020   iPhone lineup.  Image source: Intel.Let's take a closer look at the details in the report.A while back, Intel announced that its first   5G    modem is a part known as the XMM 8060. Fast Company says this   part   isn't    what Apple will be shipping as part of its first 5G-capable   iPhones. Instead, the report says "Apple plans to use Intel's   8161 5G modem chip for its 2020 phones." The XMM 8060, however,   "will be used for prototyping and testing the 5G iPhone."The baseband processor that's part of the XMM 8161 will   reportedly be manufactured using Intel's   upcoming 10 nanometer technology    . On Intel's Oct. 25 earnings conference call, CFO and interim   CEO Bob Swan said the yield rates of its 10nm technology "are   improving" and that the company is "on track for 10nm-based   systems on shelves during the holiday 2019 selling season."By contrast, the company's current X-GOLD 756 baseband   processor that's part of the XMM 7560 that powers Apple's latest   iPhones, as well as the successor, is manufactured using Intel's   14nm technology. The follow-on baseband that's part of Intel's   upcoming XMM 7660 modem    , known as X-GOLD 766, will be crafted using Intel's 14nm   technology, too.At its technology and manufacturing day last year, Intel   indicated that the performance per watt of its 10nm technologies   was substantially greater than that of its 14nm technologies.  Image source: Intel.Fast Company claims that Apple "has been unhappy with Intel   lately," probably "related to the challenge of solving heat   dissipation issues caused by the 8060 modem chip."The report claims that while "Apple's current issues with   Intel are not serious enough to cause Apple to reopen   conversations with   Qualcomm    about supplying 5G modems," the iPhone maker "   has    held conversations with another chipmaker, MediaTek, about   potentially supplying 5G modem chips."Fast Company's source did reportedly say, though, that going   with MediaTek would be a "distant 'Plan B'" and that "Apple and   Intel have ample time to correct problems in the Intel modem   platform."Back on the July 26 earnings call, Swan said the following   with respect to the gross margin of its modem business:In terms of modem in particular, yes, we do expect to     improve gross margins for our modem business, both with our     7560 product that will begin to ship in the second half, but     also as we migrate to a 5G world, we expect margins in the     modem business to continue to improve. So yes, we expect modem     profitability to improve.So if Intel wins all of Apple's 5G modem business, it seems   likely that those products will be more profitable than the   modems Intel is currently supplying to Apple.Intel still also has   some room to grow its share of Apple's iPhone   modem business    . If we assume that Intel wins the entirety of the modem orders   in next year's iPhones and then further assume that it will win   all    of the 2020 iPhone modem business, then when Apple introduces its   5G iPhones in the fall of 2020, it'll be using Intel modems   exclusively in its iPhone lineup at the time. That share growth   should help boost Intel's modem revenue from current levels.On top of that, Apple would probably be using the XMM 7560 in   its lowest-end product -- likely to be a discounted version of   this year's   iPhone XR     -- along with the XMM 7660 in its mid-range product, and   then the 5G-capable XMM 8161 in the flagship models.Since Swan indicated that the XMM 7560 carries a fatter   gross margin    than the other modems it's selling to Apple, the overall gross   margin of Intel's modem business could grow quite nicely over the   next several years.  10 stocks we like better than Intel       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

 Shares of   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) have been slammed recently. Between the company's   Nov. 1 earnings release and market close on Monday, Nov. 5,   shares fell more than 9%. That's a surprising hit for a company   that just reported a quarter of strong double-digit revenue and   earnings-per-share growth -- both of which grew at an accelerated   rate compared to the prior quarter.Is    Apple stock    's pullback a buying opportunity?  Apple's recently launched iPad Pro. Image source: Apple.Before investors decide whether they should buy Apple stock on   this pullback, it's wise to understand what has made the market   more pessimistic on the stock recently. The primary reason boils   down to Apple's guidance.In its fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the company posted some   exceptional results. Revenue and earnings per share soared 20%   and 41% year over year. Even more, both revenue and EPS   easily beat consensus analyst estimates    . The tech giant's revenue guidance for its first quarter of   fiscal 2019, however, came in below expectations. Apple said it   expected fiscal first-quarter revenue between $89 billion and $93   billion when analysts expected revenue for the period to be just   over $93 billion.With Apple's revenue guidance implying just 1% to 5%   year-over-year growth, some investors may worry these lower   levels of growth could become the new norm.Concerns were exacerbated when management said during the   earnings call that it would no longer break out unit sales in its   quarterly updates, instead opting to focus entirely on   revenue."As demonstrated by our financial performance in recent years,   the number of units sold in any 90-day period is not necessarily   representative of the underlying strength of our business,"   explained CFO Luca Maestri in the   fourth-quarter earnings call    . "Furthermore, a unit of sale is less relevant for us today than   it was in the past given the breadth of our portfolio and the   wider sales price dispersion within any given product line."Despite Maestri's explanation, some investors may have taken   Apple's decision not to provide unit sales data for iPhone, iPad,   and Mac as a signal that management is worried about its ability   to continue growing unit sales.But are these really good enough reasons for Apple stock to   sell off by 9%? Not necessarily.  Apple CEO Tim Cook. Image source: Apple.First of all, though Apple did cite weakness in some emerging   markets as one of the reasons for its conservative guidance going   into the holiday quarter, management also said one of the   constraining factors was simply uncertainty about supply. "[W]e   have an unprecedented number of products ramping and while our   ramps are going fairly well, we have uncertainty around supply   and demand balance," Maestri said when discussing the company's   guidance in the earnings call. With this background in mind,   adopting a conservative forecast makes perfect sense.It would be more worrisome if Apple's expectation for soft   growth were based primarily on demand trends, but this isn't the   case. Also, if Apple does face supply constraints during the   quarter, they will likely be solved as the fiscal year moves on,   leading to higher growth rates in later quarters.Second -- and perhaps more importantly -- Apple's valuation is   now dipping into compelling territory. The company now has a   price-to-earnings ratio below 18 -- down from above 22 in early   October. This puts Apple at a discount to the average P/E ratio   of stocks in the   S&P 500    of about 22. For a company with eight quarters in a row of   accelerating revenue growth rates,   strong pricing power    , and 29% year-over-year EPS growth in fiscal 2018, Apple stock   looks cheap at 18 times earnings.For opportunistic investors willing to hold for the long haul,   now may be a good time to pick up some shares.

TDS Hits 52-Week High on Solid Q3 & Healthy Growth Dynamics
Shares of Telephone and Data Systems, Inc.TDS scaled a new 52-week high of $35.00 during yesterday's trading session, before closing a tad lower at $33.76, for a healthy one-year return of 10.3%. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has the potential for further price appreciation and looks poised to touch new highs in the remainder of 2018 on the back of healthy growth dynamics.Growth Drivers
 Telephone and Data Systems reported solid third-quarter 2018 results, primarily driven by higher U.S. Cellular's revenues and profitability. Both the top line and the bottom line surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate in the quarter. Net income came in at $46 million or 41 cents per share against a loss of $181 million or loss of $1.64 per share in the year-ago quarter primarily due to lower total operating expenses. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15 cents. Quarterly total operating revenues were $1,297 million compared with $1,251 million in the prior-year quarter. The top line surpassed the consensus estimate of $1,288 million. (Read More: Telephone and Data Systems Q3 Earnings Top Estimates )
 The company has been increasingly focusing on business services, like cloud-based back-up services and managed IP connections. Notably, its managed IP connections have continued to increase over the past few quarters. Moreover, its personal cloud service - younited by F-Secure - has boosted the market share, as well as helped the company expand cloud services beyond the conventional enterprise market in the retail segment. It also plans to purchase and build a cloud TV platform, which is expected to be launched in the second half of 2019 across wireline and cable markets.
 Telephone and Data Systems is looking for lucrative opportunities to bring more fiber, in order to better address services, both in its current footprint and adjacent areas. By leveraging on fiber, Telephone and Data Systems is trying to respond to customers' growing TV and broadband service demand. Currently, it is making significant investments to increase fiber deployment in the existing markets and overbuilding in the newer ones. All these investments have strengthened the company's fiber-based broadband networks. Such strategic moves highlight its efforts to diversify its business model from a telecom service provider to fiber provider.
 In addition, Telephone and Data Systems is experiencing stellar smartphone demand in its wireless wing - U.S. Cellular. The addition of Apple Inc. AAPL -manufactured iPhones and other branded mobile phones, such as Samsung Note series, has been driving the company's revenues. We believe the long-term higher average revenue per user from smartphone users and full utilization of the LTE network capacity, backed by migration of customers from 3G to 4G networks, will mitigate the operating cost headwinds arising from higher subsidies on smartphones. Also, the device-instalment plan will likely offset losses from smartphone subsidies.
 The company's earnings estimates have been trending north for the past couple of months, highlighting bullish broker sentiment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has doubled in the past year to 70 cents, further strengthening its inherent growth potential.Other Stocks to Consider
 Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader industry are Comtech Telecommunications Corp. CMTL and Ribbon Communications Inc. RBBN , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .
 Comtech has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 5%. It trumped earnings estimates in each of the preceding four quarters, the average positive surprise being 136%.        
 Ribbon Communications has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 12%. It surpassed earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average positive surprise being 180.2%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple, Visa and Starbucks. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here >>>Buy-ranked Apple 's shares have gained +22.6% year to date and have outperformed the broader market with the S&P 500 gaining +1.9% over the same period. Apple's fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results were driven by robust iPhone average selling price (ASP) as well as strength in the services and wearables segments.The Zacks analyst thinks the Services segment has become the new cash cow for Apple and will grow strongly driven by increasing adoption of Apple Music & Apple Pay. Moreover, Apple is expected to benefit from an expanded portfolio with the launch of new iPhones. Further, robust demand for wearables is expected to drive top-line growth.Apple's foray into fast-growing technologies like autonomous vehicle, artificial intelligence (AI) & AR/VR will drive further growth. However, the company continues to lose share in the smartphone market. Moreover, increasing competition from Chinese handset makers remains a concern.(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>> ).Shares of Visa have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+24.9% vs. +18.3%). Visa's earnings beat expectations. Also, the bottom line improved year over year. Results were driven by growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions, and a lower tax rate.The Zacks analyst thinks numerous strategic acquisitions and alliances, technology upgrades and effective marketing have paved the way for long-term growth and consistent revenue rise. Visa is well poised to gain from the growing electronic payment processing and strong international business. Nevertheless, high client incentives and operating expenses and foreign exchange volatility may pressure margins.(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>> ).Buy-ranked Starbucks ' shares are up +23.5% over the past three months, outperforming the Zacks Food & Restaurants industry, which is up +9.1% over the same period. The Zacks analyst thinks the trend is likely to continue, given its impressive performance in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018.Results were primarily driven by robust Americas and U.S. comparable store sales. Starbucks' largest market the United States, reported comps growth of 4%, which marks the strongest gain in the past five quarters. Also, the company's operating fundamentals such as solid global footprint, successful innovations, best-in-class loyalty program and digital offerings are encouraging.Again, digital initiatives like mobile order/pay, delivery services and third-party loyalty partnerships can further stimulate robust sales trends in the Americas. Additionally, Starbucks has teamed up with Nestle SA to revitalize their respective coffee domains. However, operating margin contraction over the past few quarters has been a major concern.(You can read the full research report on Starbucks here >>> ).Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include BP plc and BlackRock.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn Wednesday after the market closes, Square (NYSE: SQ ) will announce its third-quarter results - and it will certainly be an important report. After all, the SQ stock has been in the bear mode lately, dragged down by the rest of the tech sector.Since late September, Square stock has gone from $100 to $73. Although, the performance for the year has still been standout. Note that the year-to-date return for SQ is 124%.OK then, let's take a look at the projections for SQ earnings. According to the company's own projections, Q3 revenues are expected to range from $407 to $412 million while adjusted earnings are forecast to come in at 8 cents to 10 cents a share. As for the Street consensus, the revenues are expected to reach $413.67 and earnings to be 11 cents.Q3 was also active for Square. Here are just some of the notable events:However, as for the impact on SQ stock, the biggest piece of news was the unexpected departure of CFO Sarah Friar . She plans to take the CEO post at Nextdoor, which is a social networking startup. On the news, SQ stock dropped over 10%.There is no replacement yet. And given the difficulties of finding top-notch talent - especially someone who has public company experience - the search is likely to take a while.Friar joined Square in 2012 and was key in managing various financings as well as the public offering.

  Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) pioneered the idea of allowing people to pay for   their purchases anywhere in its stores with assistance from   roaming staffers, rather than requiring them to wait in a   traditional checkout line. Indeed, Apple Stores don't even have   dedicated cashiers or registers -- the tech company has fully   embraced the mobile model.That makes some sense for a retailer that largely sells a   limited variety of expensive items, and where customers generally   aren't purchasing many of them at once. It's convenient when the   salesperson helping you can also close out the transaction --   and, in theory, it cuts down on waiting.Now, as the 2018 holiday shopping season gets underway, both   Walmart    (NYSE: WMT) and   Target    (NYSE: TGT) plan to give their own variations on the Apple model   a try. They will offer checkout via roving employees, though   neither will be getting rid of its traditional cashiers.  Walmart's new "Checkout with Me" lets consumers avoid     waiting in line for a traditional cashier. Image source:     Walmart.The discount retailers will be executing similar plans in   slightly different ways. As Target explained its mobile checkout   offering in a press release:Using specially equipped handheld devices, team members     simply scan any item in a guest's basket or shopping cart and     accept payment by credit card on the spot from anywhere in the     store. During peak events like Black Friday, team members will     be located in the busiest areas of the store, such as     Electronics. This checkout technology is the latest feature     built by Target's technology team to make shopping easier for     guests.Walmart is doing roughly the same thing, and explained what it   calls "Checkout with Me" in a press release of its own:To make checkout easier, starting Nov. 1, Walmart is     positioning associates in the busiest areas of its stores, like     the garden center, electronics or in action alley, so customers     can bypass regular checkout lines and pay for everything right     in the department they are shopping. Associates will help     customers pay and go by simply swiping their credit card and     providing them with a paper or electronic receipt for their     purchase.In both cases, customers who choose this option won't have to   wait in line to check out. That should, in theory, lead to   shorter lines for those less tech-savvy shoppers who prefer to   use traditional cashiers, assuming both chains staff their   registers at the same levels as they have in previous years. Amazon    has taken this evolution a step further in its Amazon Go   convenience stores, where it has eliminated checkout entirely.   Customers simply grab the items they want, and are charged for   them automatically when they exit the store. You do need to have   the Amazon Go app installed on your mobile device, and have a   payment method associated with it, but if your personal tech is   set up, you can shop and leave without even having to scan your   purchases.Among the more upscale chains,   Macy's    debuted its own scan-and-go mobile checkout system in March; its   customers can   check out their own purchases    , though they still have to stop at a station near a store exit   to get their receipts checked and have any security tags removed   from their items. And a number of other mall-based store chains   have been supplementing traditional checkouts with roaming   employees outfitted with portable payment devices.Waiting in line is an annoyance, and technology has made it a   reasonably easy pain point for retailers to remove. This year may   not bring the end of traditional checkout, but it's a clear   tipping point in the shift away from it.  10 stocks we like better than Walmart Inc.

Can the news get any worse for the Apple  (AAPL) supplier stocks? Sure. But it might not matter.After all, suppliers received a double whammy of disappointing Apple earnings and an iPhone XR production cut  that knocked Apple down 9% over the past couple of days. But the 52 Apple suppliers Barron's tracks, including Qualcomm  (QCOM), Western Digital  (WD) and Intel  (INTC) to name three, are down only about 1% in aggregate on those news items.The supplier group did led the way down though. They've fallen about 8% this year, and are down over 9% since October 4, when Bloomberg reported  tiny chips were placed in servers sold to Apple. The allegations of hardware hacking  against server maker Super Micro Computer  (SMCI) hit the group hard, despite the company's claim on Oct. 19 that inserting an unauthorized component on a mother board was "practically impossible." The U.S.-Chinese trade conflict and a weakening demand outlook  have also hit the shares.Today's report that Apple is dialing back production levels for its new iPhone XR could be seen as just another piece of bad news, except for the fact that it isn't sending suppliers lower. That suggests there is enough fear already reflected in the stocks.The semiconductors certainly look sufficiently beaten up. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index  is down about 17% from its highs and is trading for about 11.4 times forward earnings. That is a significant discount to history and at levels not seen since 2012.So any hint that 2019 could be better than expected, or even a small thaw in the trade conflict could be big positive for the supplier group. And it should go without saying that a positive resolution to the hardware hacking story would be another big positive. Apple management didn't update their comments about the hack on the quarterly conference call. Management did talk about trade negotiations briefly and said they are hopeful things will work out.Are we making too big a deal about Apple and its suppliers? We think not. Apple has its own gravitational pull. Its market value is close to $1 trillion, and its suppliers have a $1 trillion market cap as well. To put that in perspective, General Motors'  (GM) top 10 largest suppliers have a market value about three times as large as GM, but only total $160 billion.Charles Wilson, defense secretary for President Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s was supposed to have said "what's good for General Motors  is good for America." That was probably true back then, and it is probably true for Apple today.Its definitely true for Apple's suppliers. Write to  Al Root at  allen.root@dowjones.com 
Higher prices, lending curbs dim Diwali festival for Indian retailers
 By Aditi Shah and Nivedita Bhattacharjee NEW DELHI/BENGALURU, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Higher prices, lending curbs and a move to online shopping are denting the cheer for Indian retailers at this year's Diwali Hindu festival, with lacklustre sales for high-end items ranging from iPhones to cars and even gold. A weak rupee has pushed prices on Apple Inc's  costly iPhones even higher in India, while surging fuel costs and a liquidity crunch in India's shadow banking sector have taken a bite out of growth in carmakers' sales during the country's heaviest shopping weeks. The tepid sales may prompt the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to find additional ways to stimulate the economy, especially given there is an election due by May. The government has already reduced fuel excise taxes, pushed the Reserve Bank of India to ease curbs on bank lending, and provided support for weak crop prices in recent weeks. 
 UNDER STRESS Expecting the usual spike in demand during Diwali, when people traditionally buy gifts for family and friends, Sanjay Mahadik, owner of an apparel shop in Satara in the western state of Maharashtra stocked up. But demand is weak, he says. "Only a few customers are turning up. During Diwali week normally the shop gets so crowded that customers struggle to find space to stand," said Mahadik. Indian households' consumption has grown ahead of income for five years, brokerage UBS Securities India said in a note, thanks to lower interest rates that have reduced savings and encouraged people to take out more loans. But signs of a slowdown in lending by non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) as some of them struggle for liquidity may hurt discretionary consumption, UBS said. "With NBFCs and banks under stress, the availability of finance and general sentiment is affected," said Sugato Sen, deputy director general at the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), a trade body that counts Maruti Suzuki, Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen  and BMW  among others, as members. While passenger vehicle sales at Maruti Suzuki, which sells one in every two cars in India, rose just 0.6 percent to 135,948 units in October from a year ago, motorbike and scooter sales are strong as shown by the 33 percent growth reported by Bajaj Auto Ltd. Also doing well are online retailers like Amazon  and Walmart-owned Flipkart, who have both reported robust sales thanks to major promotional events this season, to the detriment of some traditional retailers. Just days ahead of Diwali, some wholesale and retail markets in cities like Mumbai saw lower customer numbers as consumers shifted to buying online to take advantage of greater discounts. Sales of large appliances grew 2.5 times year-earlier numbers during Amazon's Great Indian Festival sale last week, with smart TVs accounting for more than 50 percent of total TV sales, the online retailer said in an email. Amazon also said there was an increase in sales of air purifiers, furniture and clothes. Other big electronics retailers say zero-interest financing schemes are helping buoy demand for white goods like TVs and refrigerators. "The availability of high speed internet, Amazon and Netflix has something to do with this. People want to access that content so the feeling is that the TV must be nicer, bigger," said a large Mumbai-based retailer. 
 APPLE'S WOES For Amazon, smartphones continued to be the biggest-selling product by value but this year sales were driven by Chinese phone-makers Xiaomi and OnePlus in a setback for Apple. Sales of iPhones in India will fall for the first time since 2014, one research firm estimates, as users in the world's fastest growing major economy find the phones to be too expensive. In 2018, Apple is set to sell about 2 million phones in the country - a drop of about 1 million from last year, said Neil Shah, director at Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Research. The Cupertino, California company's struggle to win over India's 1.4 billion consumers swung more sharply into focus this week after Apple blamed a disappointing set of sales forecasts on a handful of big emerging markets like India. Rushabh Doshi, analyst at Singapore-based Canalys, said Apple could be forced to launch cheaper devices. "That is the only way it will gain volume in price-conscious markets like India," he said.

 Nov 6 (Reuters) - Apple Inc's  Asian supplier and assembler stocks fell on Tuesday on a media report that the iPhone maker had told its smartphone assemblers to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to its new iPhone XR. Taiwan-based assembler Pegatron Corp  fell 5 percent and rival Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn)  dropped 3.6 percent. Apple is widely considered the biggest customer for Foxconn. Apple shares fell nearly 4 percent on Monday after the report by the Nikkei financial daily, which fuelled concerns that the iPhone XR - the cheapest of three iPhones unveiled in September - was facing weak demand just days after it went on sale. Wistron shares were down 0.8 percent on Tuesday. "Foxconn's proportion of orders is bigger than Pegatron's with a ratio of about 6 to 4. Wistron doesn't have as many orders as the two, so the impact won't be so big there," said Nicole Tu, analyst at Yuanta Investment Consulting in Taipei. Apple began shipping the iPhone XR on Oct 26 after two weeks of pre orders. The company had released the higher priced iPhone XS and XS Max more than a month earlier. On Apple's post-earnings call last week, Chief Executive Tim Cook said he had very little sales data for the iPhone XR, but the other two models had got off to a "really great start." Apple said sales for the usually busy holiday period would likely miss analyst expectations as sales in emerging markets including India were weak.  Demand concerns have weighed on Apple's stock in the past few sessions, pushing its market value below $1 trillion. On Tuesday, shares in other Taiwan-based Apple suppliers fell sharply as well. Flexium Interconnect Inc  and camera lens-maker Largan Precision Co Ltd  were both down more than 6 percent. The Taiwan Weighted Index  was down around 0.7 percent. Among other Apple suppliers in the region, Hong Kong-based acoustic components maker AAC Technologies Holdings Inc  fell over 6 percent. South Korean electronic parts suppliers Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co Ltd  and LG Innotek Co Ltd  were down more than 7 percent. Apple on Monday did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Foxconn, Pegatron and Wistron declined to comment. 
 
 Let's have some fun. People love ranked lists of everything   from fantasy football lineups to the year's hottest songs, so   let's give Wall Street's biggest stocks the same kind of   platform.We're sizing up some of the biggest companies that trade on   stateside exchanges, a pool that includes more than 200 potential   investments. We'll rank them based on a mix of their size (   market capitalization    ), momentum (total return over the past year), and recent news.   As companies' fortunes rise and fall, we'll adjust our power   rankings every week.Let's go over this brand-new list of 50 top large-cap stocks,   starting with the cream of the crop: the top 10.  Image source: Getty Images. 10. Facebook    (NASDAQ: FB) : $432.1 billion market capitalization, down 16%   over the past yearThe world's leading social network commands the sixth-largest   market cap on U.S.-listed exchanges, but it sinks in the rankings   because it's the one name among the top 10 this week that has   seen its stock decline over the past year. You've heard the story   by now. Facebook is bumping up against privacy concerns.   Millennials are shying away from Facebook. They're flocking to   Instagram -- perhaps unaware that it's also owned by Facebook --   and that platform has been tougher for the company to monetize.   Sorry, Facebook -- your friend request has been denied. 9. Pfizer    (NYSE: PFE) : $251.7 billion, up 21.1%The "P" is silent in Pfizer, but the same can't be said about   the pharmaceuticals giant's profits. Revenue only rose 2% in its   latest quarter as new drugs offset the declines of older   treatments that are now off patent and thus facing generic   competition. Nevertheless, adjusted earnings per share rose 16%.   Pfizer also received accelerated FDA approval for Lorbrena, a   potential treatment for a type of non-small cell lung cancer. The   stock's juicy 3.1% dividend yield doesn't hurt either. The "P" in   potential also isn't silent. 8. JPMorgan Chase    (NYSE: JPM) : $360.4 billion, up 6.7%A giant in consumer banking, investment banking, and credit   cards, JPMorgan remains a smart way to play the   financial-services industry. Lyft announced last month that it   was tapping JPMorgan to serve as lead underwriter for its highly   anticipated IPO. JPMorgan commands one of the lower valuations in   this list, selling for less than 12 times this year's earnings.   The stock also offers a dividend yield of nearly 3%. 7. Walmart    (NYSE: WMT) : $296.8 billion, up 14.1%There's money to be made in discounting. Walmart is the   country's leading brick-and-mortar retailer, but it has stepped   up its online game recently with the acquisitions of Jet.com and   Flipkart. Walmart disappointed investors last month when it   lowered its adjusted earnings outlook for fiscal 2019 to account   for dilution from the Flipkart transaction, but it sees sales   growing at least 3% in fiscal 2020. Shoppers love a good   bargain. 6. Visa    (NYSE: V) : $309.8 billion, up 26%We're becoming a cash-less society, and credit card giant Visa   is there for the swiping. Visa processed $32.8 billion in   transactions during the third quarter, 12% ahead of where it was   a year earlier. Visa remains a widely accepted card platform   worldwide, and you have to give it some -- double bad pun alert   -- credit for leading the charge. 5. Berkshire Hathaway    (NYSE: BRK-A) : $512.1 billion, up 8.8%Even at age 88, Warren Buffett remains the best investor of   our generation. Most investors can't afford even a single share   of the company's original Class A shares, but that's what happens   when you command the only six-digit stock price in the investing   universe. (The Class B shares, meanwhile, cost only a couple   hundred dollars, rather than a few hundred thousand.) Berkshire   Hathaway's book value has ballooned to $228,712 per share as of   the end of September. Buffett sure knows how to create value,   even as he scoffs at your request to break a $100,000 bill. 4. Alphabet    (NASDAQ: GOOG) : $740.4 billion, up 2.7%The company formerly known as Google has barely moved over the   past year. It ran into some bad press last week when   The New York Times    wrote a scathing report claiming that top executives engaged in   sexual misconduct. Financially speaking, Alphabet is a tale of   two extremes. Its revenue is accelerating for the third year in a   row, but earnings growth has gone the opposite direction.   Alphabet has missed Wall Street profit targets twice over the   past year, which is a rare occurrence in the company's   history. 3. Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) : $814.4 billion, up 52.2%The world's leading online retailer turned heads this summer   when it followed Apple in hitting the $1 trillion market cap   mark. Amazon didn't stay in the 13-digit club for long: Its   shares slipped two weeks ago after the company posted fresh   financials that didn't wow the market. Amazon missed analyst   sales estimates, and its guidance suggests decelerating online   growth will continue. Amazon remains a big winner over the past   year, but torrid gains have a funny way of inflating   expectations. 2. Microsoft    (NASDAQ: MSFT) : $814.9 billion, up 26.3%Fire up the DeLorean, Doc, and let's go back to the future.   Apple and Microsoft are on top of this list, and it may seem like   a throwback to the 1980s, when the two companies were the   darlings of the nascent PC space. Microsoft is no longer just   about pushing Windows operating systems and Office applications.   It's a multifaceted software giant, and it has actually   outperformed    Apple stock    over the past year. 1. Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) : $986.6 billion, up 23.4%The world's most valuable company by market cap disappointed   investors with its quarterly report last week, but its dominant   market position and still-hearty double-digit return over the   past 12 months keep it entrenched at the top. Apple posted   better-than-expected results for its fiscal fourth quarter, but   soft iPhone unit sales and a problematic outlook for the holiday   quarter rained on the earnings-season parade. The new iPhones   sell at much higher price points, so it's not a deal breaker if   the actual number of iPhones sold is slowing. Apple also unveiled   new MacBooks. There's never a dull moment in Cupertino.We'll get to No. 11 through No. 50 in a moment, but first,   let's look at some other top-50 stocks that are making waves --   for better or worse. Starbucks    (NASDAQ: SBUX)  introduced holiday-themed reusable cups last   week, and as fate would have it, the baron of baristas saw its   app go glitchy at the lousiest time. The non-responsive Starbucks   app is a pretty big deal now that the chain is relying on an   uptick in mobile orders to offset sluggish walk-in traffic.Last week's quarterly report saw Starbucks check in with a   better-than-expected 3% increase in comparable-store sales   worldwide -- and an even beefier 4% increase in the Americas --   but this is mostly the result of folks spending more on orders,   rather than a rise in customer counts.Starbucks is trying. It's putting even more marketing muscle   behind Starbucks Rewards, the loyalty program that has increased   its user base by 15% to 15.3 million active members over the past   year. The chain is also committed to improving the in-store   experience, which is no easy task as its counters become crowded   with customers placing orders, others picking up mobile orders,   and third-party delivery services fulfilling online requests.One stock on this list that's headed in the wrong direction is   AT&T    (NYSE: T) , whose share price tumbled after last month's   quarterly report disappointed investors. DIRECTV is losing   satellite television subscribers, and landline customers are   ditching their hardwired talk boxes. AT&T's silver linings   were continuing growth in its wireless service and initially   strong contributions from Time Warner, which it acquired in a   $110 billion deal earlier this year.AT&T has increased its dividend for 34 years in a row. The   hikes have historically come near the end of the year, and the   stock will be in for more pain if it fails to stretch its   payout-boosting streak to 35 years in a few weeks. 11.

Slow yet steady growth has   helped China Mobile's stock hold up better than glitzier growth   companies in the country, and a fat dividend is also keeping   income investors close.

 Nov 6 (Reuters) - Apple Inc's  Asian supplier and assembler stocks fell on Tuesday on a media report that the iPhone maker had told its smartphone assemblers to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to its new iPhone XR. Taiwanese assembler Pegatron Corp  fell nearly 4 percent and rival Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn)  fell 2.5 percent. Apple is widely considered the biggest customer for Foxconn. Apple shares fell nearly 4 percent on Monday after the report from the Nikkei financial daily, which fuelled concerns that the iPhone XR - the cheapest of three iPhones unveiled in September - was facing weak demand just days after it hit shelves. A bunch of Apple's other Taiwanese suppliers fell sharply, including camera lens-maker Largan Precision Co Ltd, which was down more than 7 percent, and Flexium Interconnect Inc, which fell 6 percent. The Taiwan Weighted Index  was down around 0.9 percent. Hong Kong-based acoustic components supplier AAC Technologies Holdings Inc  fell 7 percent. South Korean electronic parts suppliers Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co Ltd  and LG Innotek Co Ltd  were down more than 6 percent. The Nikkei report comes days after Apple said sales for the usually busy holiday period would likely miss analyst expectations as sales in emerging markets including India were weak.  Apple on Monday did not respond to Reuters' request for comment. Foxconn and Pegatron declined to comment on specific customers or products. Wistron was not immediately available for comment. 
 
 By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Asian shares wobbled on Tuesday, supported by Wall Street gains although sentiment was tempered ahead of the U.S. midterm elections, the first major electoral test of President Donald Trump's big tax cuts and hostile trade policies. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged down 0.1 percent, weighed by a fall in and Chinese shares and technology shares while Japan's Nikkei  managed to gain 1.0 percent. On Wall Street, the S&P 500  gained 0.56 percent, with financials such as Berkshire Hathaway  supported by strong earnings. In oil markets, crude prices wobbled near multi-month lows after the United States granted eight countries temporary waivers allowing them to continue buying oil from Iran as Washington formally imposed punitive sanctions on the Islamic republic. Ahead of Tuesday's U.S. elections, investors generally expect opposition Democrats to take over the House of Representatives while Trump's Republican Party is tipped to retain the Senate. While political gridlock between the White House and Congress could hinder Trump's pro-business agenda and raise political instability, including hearings centring on the administration, some analysts say such an outcome may have already been priced in by investors. If the Republicans retain their House majority, global stocks are likely to rally on hopes of more tax cuts. Trump said last month his administration planned to produce a resolution calling for a 10 percent tax cut for middle-income households.  "Everyone still remembers strong equity rallies after Trump was elected two years ago. So initially stock markets will gain," said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. "But further tax cuts would boost already large fiscal deficits and push the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield above its October high almost instantly. Given rises in U.S. bond yields triggered a correction in equities last month, any rally in stocks is unlikely to last long," he added. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield stood at 3.203 percent, maintaining most of its gains following Friday's strong U.S. jobs and wage data and staying not far from its 7 1/2-year peak of 3.261 percent hit on Oct. 9. "Global equities have recovered after their fall in February, which was triggered by rise in U.S. yields. But this time a recovery will likely be capped because now markets do not have the support they had back in February from tame inflation and the economic boost from Trump's tax cuts," said Shuji Shirota, head of macro-economic strategy at HSBC in Tokyo.  Many investors also expect Trump to continue to take a hard line on trade, regardless of the outcome of the elections. "The impact of trade war will start to appear in U.S. economic data in coming months," Shirota added. But some other analysts noted that U.S. equities tended to rally after midterm elections, possibly because markets tend to price in political risks ahead of the elections.  In oil markets, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude  futures slipped 0.3 percent to $62.86 a barrel after hitting a seven-month low of $62.52 on Monday.    Brent crude  futures dropped 0.3 percent to $72.93 a barrel, near Friday's 2 1/2-month low of $72.16.  Both oil benchmarks have slid more than 15 percent since hitting four-year highs in early October.  Moves in major currencies were modest. The euro traded at $1.1408, about one cent above this year's low of $1.1301 touched on Aug. 15. The yen  changed hands at 113.28 per dollar, near its three-week low of 113.385 marked last Wednesday. The British pound  touched a two-week high of $1.3070 and last stood at $1.3058. 
 
 
 By Heekyong Yang and Ju-min Park SEOUL, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Keen to make its foldable smartphone the next big thing, Samsung Electronics Co  will depart from its usual policy of keeping product plans highly secret and provide some details of the phone's key features for app developers this week. The goal is garnering critical feedback as new technologies will require developers to tweak apps to make sure they run smoothly when the phone folds out into tablet form. The move also underscores a new level of caution in product planning after a costly recall for its fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 in 2016. "Unlike our flagship products, the foldable phone is a completely new concept in terms of design and user experience, which requires a different approach," said a Samsung official who declined to be identified as details of the phone were not yet public. "Before we take it to the market, we want to share with developers what we've done so far and see what they think of it," the official said. Foldable phones hold the promise of allowing consumers to do more complex work that would normally be done on a tablet or laptop, but with a device that becomes far more compact. The South Korean tech giant is among a handful of firms which have flagged that foldable phones will be coming to market soon. Although it has so far been mum on exactly when, analysts expect a launch date in the first half of 2019 - any later and Samsung would run the risk of new Apple phones stealing its thunder. China'sHuawei Technologies Co Ltd  has also said it is planning to launch a 5G smartphone with a foldable screen in mid-2019. Both, however, have been pipped to the post by Royole, a Chinese display making start-up, which last week unveiled a foldable phone with a 7.8 inch screen, priced from around $1,300. It said it will start filling orders from late December, although little is known about the firm's projected sales. Lee Kyeong-tae, Samsung vice president for mobile communication, said last week the phone's user interface will be unveiled at an annual conference for app developers which will take place in San Francisco on Wednesday. Another Samsung official with knowledge of the matter told Reuters it will be the first time that detailed images of the new phone will be presented in public. Expectations that the phone itself will be on display are, however, low. High price tags are expected to prevent foldable phones from immediately becoming big hits, and some analysts even doubt there is huge appetite for such a product. But if Samsung can create some buzz around the new phones, it would be a welcome salve for its mobile division, which just last week reported quarterly profit tumbling by a third, squeezed by competition with Apple and as Chinese rivals spruce up their mid-range products with features similar to Samsung's. Research firm Strategy Analytics forecast in May global sales of just 1.2 million foldable phones next year though should soar to about 64.9 million phones in 2023. That would, however, account for just 3.5 percent of projected global smartphone sales. "First, Samsung needs to show foldable smartphones are commercially viable. If they become established well enough to take a place in flagship product line-ups like the S-series and Note-series, then foldables might just help turn around the company's underperforming mobile business," said Greg Roh, an analyst at HMC Investment & Securities.

  Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) posted seemingly strong results, but the market   was disappointed in changes to its reporting and guidance. Ditto   for   Spotify    (NYSE: SPOT) , which made some changes to its expected subscriber   counts for 2018 and sold off after its report. But   Fitbit    (NYSE: FIT) made a statement with the success of its smartwatch   segment, and its shares soared.Should Apple and Spotify investors be worried? And Does Fitbit   belong on your watchlist?

This video was recorded on Nov. 2, 2018.  Dylan Lewis:    Welcome to    Industry Focus     , the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock   market every day. It's Friday, November 2nd, and we're talking   tech earnings. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis. I'm joined on Skype by   senior tech specialist, Evan Niu. Evan, how was your   Halloween? Evan Niu:    It was good! The kids had a good time. Lewis:     You've got two young kids. What were the costumes this   year? What did they get into? Niu:     They did Batman and Harley Quinn. Lewis:    Alright! And did you and your wife dress up? Or did you just take   the kids around? Niu:    My wife is into dressing up. I am not because I'm not fun like   that. Lewis:    [laughs] You can't even make concessions with the kids?! I   wound up doing two costumes this year. I had a   Harry Potter    murder mystery that I did last weekend with some friends, and   then, I was the Morty to my girlfriend's Rick of   Rick and Morty    over the weekend. I went from having a nice, big beard to shaving   it, because to be a 14-year-old boy for Halloween, you cannot   have a beard. But it sounds like we both had a pretty good time.   I hope your kids had plenty of candy loot. It's probably driving   you a little crazy. Niu:    Oh yeah, of course. Lewis:    We're going to be talking about our treat, Evan, and that is   financial reports and some fresh earnings takes on some companies   that we love to cover. We have big earnings releases from Fitbit,   Spotify and Apple. We're going to do our best to hit all   three and not get too, too long-winded. I know we can do that   sometimes when we talk Apple.Why don't we kick things off with Fitbit? This is a company   that has desperately needed some good news, and it seems like   they finally got it with this new report. Niu:    It was a pretty strong release, in my opinion. Revenue was up to   about $393 million, which beat its own forecasts as well as   analyst expectations. The big news here is that they became   profitable again. They've been losing money for about two years   as people have been shifting away from these basic fitness   trackers toward more full-featured smartwatches. The big   challenge has always been, can they transition from trackers to   smartwatches successfully? And, of course, they still sell   trackers. Those are really popular in the Middle East, Africa,   and some of those emerging markets. But in the U.S., it's really   all about smartwatches these days. They were able to post   adjusted net income of $10 million, or $0.04 per share. Getting   back in the black. Lewis:    Worth noting that on, on a GAAP basis, they did lose money. We   have to emphasize that adjusted income there. Exploring that   outperformance a little bit, it seems like the company is seeing   success with the smartwatch line. That was really the big,   looming question for them. With the more simplified fitness   trackers out there, and that market being a little bit tougher   with some competitors like   Xiaomi    in the mix, can they go to the smartwatch market and make a big   splash? It seems like the answer is yes. Niu:    Right, especially after their first smartwatch, the Ionic,   flopped. That thing did not sell well. It didn't look that   appealing from a mainstream perspective. They considered more of   a niche performance type positioning, whereas the Versa is very   clearly resonating much better with consumers. If you remember,   they spent years acquiring different little companies to help   them build their smartwatch strategy. And now, we're seeing the   results of that. They sold about 3.5 million devices during the   quarter. Average selling prices were up a little bit to $108 as   the product mix continues to shift toward smartwatches, which are   now about half of revenue. I do think they're making some really   impressive progress here. Lewis:     You look at the overall market share, a year ago, they had   0% market share in smartwatches. Flash forward to now, they are   one of the major players, they're in second place in this market.   Not only are the financial results looking good, but in the   competitive landscape, they are not only holding their own but   taking market share from other players. Niu:    Exactly. Since Ionic launched in Q4 of last year, a year ago,   they really didn't have anything. Now, we fast forward to today.   Android Wear OS, which used to be Android Wear, has done so   terribly. No one is really buying those devices.   Alphabet     really failed on execution in terms of getting into   wearables. I think that's given Fitbit this opportunity to step   up and fill that need, provide some type of alternative to Apple   Watch. Apple Watch is still the dominant smartwatch in the world   right now, but people want competition, people want alternatives,   and Fitbit is really offering something else. Lewis:    Outside of the financials, looking at some of the user activity,   I think there are a lot of really encouraging signs there. A lot   of the activations that they're seeing over this quarter are from   new users. It seems like engagement with folks that had been   users at some point and then fallen off is starting to get   revitalized a little bit. Niu:    Right. That's always been a big problem with these basic fitness   trackers. It's like when people start going to the gym, then you   get kind of lazy, then you just stop going. People would buy   these fitness trackers, use them for a couple of months, and then   just stop using them. Let's face it, we're all lazy.   [laughs] The big challenge for Fitbit has always been, how   do we keep these users engaged? How do we motivate them to stay   active and improve their lives and health? They're starting to   make some progress there. They said that out of the existing   users that had bought new Fitbits this quarter, about half of   them had previously been inactive. So, they are starting to get   more people back on the platform that had previously been   dormant. Lewis:    After quarters of declines on the revenue side, the market was   very happy to see some revenue growth, even if it was pretty   meager. How are you feeling about this company? It's up like 35%   since this earnings release. Does anything that you've seen here   change your outlook on this business? Niu:    I do think it was a very strong report, and I do think they're   making a lot of progress with this turnaround. They had been on   the ropes for a while with these fitness trackers. But, at the   same time, I don't think they're out of the woods yet. This is   going to be a long game. We're talking about smartwatch   platforms. Any platform strategy, by default, is a very long-term   strategy. So, they're making progress, but they still have to   keep going. They're also in consumer hardware. It's notoriously   difficult. You have to constantly innovate, constantly put out   new products that people like, you have to build your platform,   you have to get more app developers on there. There are just so   many pieces to do well and maintain over time. And, you're   competing against literally the richest company in the world. So,   it's going to be tough. That said, I'm impressed that they've   been able to do as well as they have over the past couple of   years with transitioning to smartwatches that people want to   buy. Lewis:     They're guiding for what is essentially a slight decline in   revenue next quarter after being basically flat year over   year this most recent quarter. It's not like the hardware segment   is showing blistering growth. It's a nice return, and it's a show   of strength in some key categories for them, but hardware is   still this business. It's all of their revenue. That hasn't   changed. And I think what makes a hardware company really   compelling is if they can create a really viable platform. And I   don't see that yet with this company. There's so much potential   for it, but unless I start seeing the signs and some money coming   in on the software side for them, I'm going to remain a skeptic.   I think I can find better places to put my money, honestly. Niu:     I totally agree with you. They've been talking about this   idea of building up the services business for a long time, and   they're still trying, and they want to get into corporate   wellness programs. But these are still less than 1% of revenue.   Again, when it comes to building a platform, you want to get away   from relying totally on hardware, and grow your software and   services business a little bit. And on that front, they have not   made much progress. Lewis:     Why don't we switch gears and talk Spotify? The market was   happy with Fitbit's results, not exactly the case for Spotify. We   saw a pretty big sell-off after earnings. The company is actually   down to lows since they've gone public. This is the lowest we've   seen shares. Niu:    Investors weren't too happy with Spotify. I think part of it was   their guidance. As far as the results for this quarter goes,   revenue came in at about $1.5 billion. Premium subscriptions are   continuing to grow. Now they're at about 87 million Premium   subscribers. That's by far the biggest premium paid subscriber   base in the world in the music streaming industry. We've talked   about   Tencent    before, but Tencent, as we mentioned on other shows, most of   their users are free users. They're not actually subscribing.   Spotify is by far the market leader here.They were actually profitable, but that was a one-off   occurrence, and actually related to Tencent Music. They had a tax   benefit related to a market-to-market adjustment regarding the   value of Spotify's stake in Tencent Music. If you remember, they   did an equity swap last year. When Tencent Music filed to go   public, there was a lot of information in there that basically   warranted them making some adjustments. So, that's where their   tax benefit came from. That's not a regularly occurring thing.   They actually lost less money than they thought on an operating   basis, which they considered a negative thing. They said, "We   should have lost more money." Lewis:     Right. This is a company that is very much in growth mode.   They're expecting to spend a lot of money, particularly on the   hiring side, in the R&D element of their business. They were   disappointed that they couldn't spend more and bring more people   on. Niu:    Right. It's basically, their operating margin improved. They   still lost money on an operating basis, but they said, "We should   have lost more. We didn't hire as many people as we wanted to."   That's also continuing into the fourth quarter, which is also why   they adjusted their guidance. Their financial guidance, they're   actually expecting to lose less money than they previously   forecasted. Again, they consider that a bad thing. They know they   need to be reinvesting very heavily into this business to really   keep growing, and profitability will come later. Lewis:    You mentioned the guidance. I think you're right, that's why   we're seeing the sell-off today. The reality is, they've   gotten bitten by their own optimism. They put out some improved   guidance last quarter, looking at their full-year outlook. They   revised all that back down to what they were originally expecting   at the beginning of the year. It's not that there's a huge reset   going on. We're talking about a difference of one million Premium   subscribers one way or the other.All told, Evan, how are you feeling about Spotify? You are a   shareholder. Niu:    I still think it's a good company for the long-term. I still   believe in where this company is going. I think this market   reaction is an overreaction. It's just minor adjustments to their   Premium subscriber outlook. Like you mentioned, it's like a   million subscribers one way or the other. That's not the kind of   number that's going to make or break this company. Investors   selling off the stock, I think, is kind of silly. We're just   going back to the guidance they issued earlier this year, which   is still strong guidance. They're expecting 93-96 million   subscribers at the end of the year. Again, they're by far the   biggest paid streaming service out there. Lewis:    If you're buying into the long-term vision of this company, and   you're thinking, "Music streaming is the future. This is one of   two companies that are extremely well-positioned to capitalize on   it in the U.S. and in Europe, some of the big markets," then one   million in one or two quarters shouldn't make a big difference.   The addressable market for these types of services is so much   bigger than that. The larger opportunity is so much bigger. I   wouldn't get too swept up in the individual guidance figures from   one quarter to the next if that's the narrative that you're   buying here. Niu:     Exactly. I'm still confident. I'm hanging on. Lewis:    I think this is also a pretty good lesson in dollar-cost   averaging on some positions. We've talked about some recent   IPOs, we've done some deep dives. It's really easy to get excited   when you first have an opportunity to scoop up shares of a   company that you've been following for some time. I think that   this movement that we're seeing is very typical, really, for a   new issuance. We're still within the first year, first couple of   reports, of Spotify as a publicly traded company. I take all this   as a reminder to why it's so important to buy into positions over   time, to dollar-cost average. There are going to be lumps with   companies as they report. The market is going to take their   lumps, as well, as we're seeing over the last couple of months.   You don't want to have a cost basis that is tied to one   particular point in time. You want to benefit from those   movements and work down to, ideally, a lower cost basis on your   position. Niu:    Especially IPOs. All IPOs are so volatile and risky in the first   year or so. The market is trying to figure out, what is this   company worth? It takes some time. Lewis:    Our last company today is Apple. This is one of our favorite ones   to talk about. Usually, this is the boring quarter for Apple. The   stock is down 7% since they reported. What happened? Niu:    [laughs] There's a lot going on here with Apple's earnings.   One of the big reasons it's down is that the guidance for the   next quarter wasn't too great. We can get to that later. Revenue   jumped about 20% to $62.9 billion, which is ahead of the   company's own guidance. iPhone unit volumes were about flat at 47   million. But iPhone revenue increased 29% to $37 billion, which   is really just more of the same that we've been seeing play out   over the past year. Ever since they introduced the $1,000 iPhone   X last year, they've been pulling this lever hard on pricing.   Pricing is really where all the growth in this business is coming   from nowadays. Units are basically flat. The past four quarters,   units have been more or less flat, but revenue has been up   considerably because they're charging so much for these phones   now. Lewis:     It's kind of incredible that, at a $1 trillion company, and   a company that's putting up tens of billions of dollars in   revenue, they are still capable of doing 20% growth. Not that we   should necessarily expect that going forward, but it's worth   emphasizing that a little bit here. Some of that is due to the   success of the iPhone segment. Some of that is due to the success   of their services segment. Niu:     Services hit a new record at $10 million in revenue for the   quarter. A year ago, they had a one-time positive adjustment of   $640 million related to a change in an accounting estimate. But   if you exclude that one-time item, that basically means they grew   27% this quarter on Services. On a trailing 12-month basis,   Services is now a $37 billion business. They've been reiterating   this target of $50 billion by 2020. They continue to march,   slowly but surely. Every quarter, they're marching closer and   closer to that goal. They're right on schedule. Lewis:     The story with this quarter for me is, past results were   great, but we're going to see some major shifts in how this   company reports. I think that really signals some major changes   with what the company expects from some of their product lines.   The financial reporting that we've gotten used to for Apple is   going to be almost unrecognizable soon. Niu:    Right. They made some very big announcements that are going to be   really important for investors, in terms of how they do their   financial reporting starting in the new fiscal year. They just   closed their fiscal year, so we're starting fiscal 2019. The big   one is that they're no longer going to report unit sales, which   is going to be very controversial, because that's always been one   of the most-watched metrics with Apple. They're also going to   start breaking things down and separating between Products and   Services. They're going to give more granular detail around the   cost of revenue for Products and Services. You'll get a much   better sense of the margin profile for Services vs. Products.   With their emphasis on Services over the past couple of years,   which is much more profitable, I think that's a good thing. But,   of course, it's a bad thing that you're going to lose the unit   data.They've been trying to shift this focus in the narrative away   from hardware to services for two or three years now. This is the   culmination. They're just getting rid of the units altogether.   They can't get clearer than that. They've been subtly saying,   "Hey, stop paying attention to units." And now, they're like,   "You can't pay attention to units anymore." You're not getting a   choice anymore. Lewis:     And you've spent so many quarters and so many years putting   together these very excellent Apple charts that track ASPs,   what's going on unit sales. Evan, all those beautiful charts are   going to be rendered obsolete! It's such a shame!In some ways, we get some more transparency. In some ways, we   get less transparency. For my money, given what a big part of the   business the iPhone segment is, I would like to know the workings   there and understand what's going on on the unit side, what's   going on on the pricing side. Obviously, my opinion doesn't   matter much, because they've already decided to make this   decision. We just have to take some solace in the fact that we'll   have a better feel for what's going on on the Services side.Also, looking forward, we hinted at this before, the guidance   that they gave for next quarter is going to be a big deceleration   from that 20% growth that we just saw. Niu:    At the midpoint, guidance is about $91 billion. That's about 3%   growth off of a year ago when they did $88 billion. This is kind   of like we talked about before -- you have such a huge business,   you're running into the law of large numbers. It's really hard to   put up double-digit growth rates off such a humongous revenue   base. There's some speculation, are they going to guide to a $100   billion quarter? That would have been mind-boggling. I mean, not   that that was expected. Analysts were at about $93 billion. So,   they do have to hit the high end of their guidance to meet   analyst expectations. It's certainly possible, they've done that   on multiple occasions on the December quarter, which is their   busiest quarter. It's kind of silly that people are disappointed   with it. They're going to be selling a billion dollars' worth of   stuff every day. How are you disappointed with that? Lewis:    That's nothing to sneeze at. With the sell-off, Apple is actually   dangerously close to falling below that $1 trillion mark that   they were the first company to hit. Evan, we've talked about   Apple a lot. We have both owned the stock for quite some time. I   think the crazy growth days for this company are over. If you're   a new investor, this is not your older cousin's Apple that's   going to be doubling every two years. What are you doing with   your Apple shares? How are you thinking about this business? Niu:     I'm not doing anything with it. I've always been a   long-term shareholder with Apple. I've never had any temptations   to sell it or anything like that. Even if the growth isn't really   there anymore, it's also worth remembering, this buyback program   that they have is so massive. Even if their top line isn't   growing a lot, your earnings per share are going to be growing   quite a bit. That will help drive the valuation of the shares and   keep them cheap, which can actually help translate into more   share gains. Not that they're going to double from here. [laughs]   But, the buyback program, they bought back over $60 billion worth   of stock this year so far. Ever since tax reform, they've bought   back $20 billion a quarter over the past three quarters. That's   not going away anytime soon. That's going to help keep that   bottom line EPS number strong for years to come. Lewis:    Yeah. They've been really excellent to their shareholders, in   terms of capital returns. That's not going to change. That's one   thing I think we can continue to bank on, so long as that cash   hoard is nice and big, and so long as the Services segment and   the iPhone segment continue to post pretty solid results. I can   think we can rest assured that that's going to be the case. Niu:    This stock is so cheap. I've always considered it a very safe   stock. They're trading at a discount to the market, something   like 13X earnings. This stock is so cheap. It's not going to tank   or anything. It's a pretty reliable play there.

Apple Covering Up Hardware Numbers, and for Good Reason
Apple AAPL produced a good quarter wherein both revenue and earnings came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate while growing strong double digits. The guidance was also in line with our expectations. But shares tanked following the announcement and continue to decline, despite Jim Cramer jumping to Apple's defense.The main culprit is the company's decision to stop reporting unit numbers for iPhone, iPad and Macs that have anyway been declining for a while. Investors and analysts alike fear that the decision is fueled by a desire to hide substantial unit declines that won't be offset by the markup in prices.The fear is not unfounded. Apple may want to project itself as a services company and want to direct investor attention to the services story and also, how it is a great place for customer satisfaction and security.But it's a little hard to sell that story when the services business contributed just 16% of revenue -- yes even if that 16% represents a 27% increase from last year after one-time items, and even if that growth rate was substantially higher than the rest of the business. While it's also true that other players like Amazon AMZN and Alphabet's GOOGL Google don't display hardware numbers, unlike Apple, hardware makes up a miniscule part of their business.So how to think about Apple's decision?Quite simply, Apple is entering a phase where its products are so overpriced that new buyers will be harder to find than before. Especially since the markets where they could come from have weaker currencies (China is a sort of exception, but trade war tensions are an overhang there).So increasingly, most of its sales will come from its captive user base that considers the task of transferring boatloads of their personal data to less secure competing services a really daunting task. And then, they will want them to last longer. This trend has started playing out already because the minimal changes in new versions just aren't enough to convince many to upgrade.So when Apple says that unit sales are less indicative of the strength in its business that is probably the truth.But in that case, what are its plans for milking the folks already hooked?Apple says it recorded "new all-time revenue records for the App Store, cloud services, AppleCare, Apple Music and Apple Pay."Moreover, it saw "exceptional performance at Apple Pay, which is by far the number one mobile contactless payment service worldwide. Transaction volume tripled year-over-year. And to put that into perspective, Apple Pay generated significantly more transactions than even PayPal Mobile, with over 4 times the growth rate."While News didn't make it to the list of services Apple mentions here, the New York Times recently reported that Apple news has around 90 million voracious readers, generating a million page views per story. So it is in a pretty good position to start offering a service from a bundle of providers.Apple says it has 330 million paid subscriptions across its ecosystem.There's also tremendous scope is the enterprise segment where its partnership with IBM IBM is going very well. To quote from the meeting with investors, "over 450 airlines and 47 of the top 50 around the world have adopted iOS" and "9 of the top 10 global retailers use iOS devices" and "240 large customers have signed MobileFirst for iOS deals." Also, since launching IBM Watson services for Core ML and the IBM Cloud Developer Console for Apple, it has added over 60 new customers across a broad cross section of industries.ConclusionApple is in a transition phase. So quarter to quarter numbers, especially on unit sales of its hardware business won't be exciting. On the other hand, it's important to remember that despite those variations, the business isn't actually weakening.While we won't be able to take part in the dizzying excitement of plotting and projecting its quarterly unit numbers and hyperventilating on the varying pitfalls of a changing business model (which is the obvious thing here), we can take heart from the fact that we will know both product and service revenue quarter to quarter. And we can take the scintillating ride to the height of its services success because it will tell us more and more on that.That's why Apple shares carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

U.S. stocks overcame a slow start to close near session highs, with the Dow notching a 190-point victory. A big day from Chevron ( CVX  ) helped lead the charge, propping up the entire energy sector in the process, while a strong showing from financial stocks helped, as well. The gains came despite the uncertainty surrounding tomorrow's  midterm elections   and more losses for Apple ( AAPL  ) shares. In fact, much of the tech sector sat out today's rally following comments from President Donald Trump about potential  antitrust violations   from names like Amazon ( AMZN  ) and Facebook ( FB  ).

Canada's main stock market was in rally mode on Monday, posting a near-triple digit advance. The S&P/TSX Composite Index was up 98 points or 0.65% to close at 15,217. The TSX lost 30 points on Friday. BoC Governor Poloz offered no surprises in a speech today in London, repeating his "rising to neutral" stance on interest rates. U.S. stocks were mixed as investors fretted about U.S.-China trade talks. The Dow Jones gained 190 points while the Nasdaq shed 28 points, weighed by losses in Apple ( AAPL  ) shares.On the TSX, healthcare added 4% as cannabis stocks advanced while energy gained 2% despite flat  oil prices  . Financials gained 0.3% while tech lost 1.1% and materials were off 0.9% on little changed  gold prices  .In stock news, Husky Energy (HSE.TO) gained 2.5% after re-affirming its hostile $6.4 billion bid for MEG Energy. Heavily traded Aurora Cannabis (ACB.TO) rose 2.5% while The Green Organic Dutchman (TGOD.TO) jumped another 26% today after gaining 27% Friday as 100 million free-trading shares became unrestricted, with the 6-month post-IPO lockout window ending. Canopy Growth (WEED.TO) rose 7% today while Baytex Energy (BTE.TO) was up 8%.In economics news, in a speech in London this morning, BoC Governor Poloz noted the difficulty of reconciling high-frequency financial market action with slower-moving economic fundamentals. He said while it may not always be possible to make sense of the markets, "the effort itself is generally worthwhile." Poloz added that the Bank of Canada must attempt to weigh both upside and downside risks and take a middle, risk-balanced path. "Given our outlook for growth and inflation, the Bank's policy rate will need to rise to a neutral stance to achieve our inflation target," he said, repeating the message he delivered to Parliament and to senators last week.The Canadian dollar was little changed at 76.31 cents US.
  (RTTNews.com) - The Indonesia stock market has finished higher in five straight sessions, advancing more than 165 points or 2.9 percent along the way. The Jakarta Composite Index now rests just above the 5,920-point plateau although the rally may stall on Tuesday. The global forecast for the Asian markets is murky ahead of U.S. midterm elections later today as weakness from oil and technology stocks will likely cap any upside. The European and U.S. markets were mixed and little changed and the Asian bourses figure to open in similar fashion. The JCI finished modestly higher on Monday following mixed performances from the financials, cement companies and resource stocks. For the day, the index added 14.30 points or 0.24 percent to finish at 5,920.59 after trading between 5,886.21 and 5,926.63. Among the actives, Lotte Chemical surged 4.55 percent, while Bank Pan Indonesia skidded 1.87 percent, Bukit Darmo Property dropped 1.67 percent, SLJ Global climbed 1.08 percent, XL Axiata added 0.48 percent, Jasa Marga shed 0.48 percent, Bank Danamon Indonesia collected 0.34 percent, Bank Central Asia gained 0.73 percent, Bank Mandiri lost 0.67 percent, Bank Negara Indonesia retreated 2.25 percent, Bank Rakyat fell 0.30 percent, Indocement advanced 0.72 percent, Semen Indonesia dipped 0.26 percent, Holcim Indonesia picked up 0.55 percent, Unilever Indonesia perked 0.82 percent, Indofood declined 0.83 percent, Aneka Tambang was down 0.72 percent, Vale Indonesia plunged 2.47 percent and Bumi Resources, Bank MNC Internasional and Indosat were unchanged. The lead from Wall Street provides little clarity as stocks moved in opposite directions on Monday, with the Dow and the S&P 500 adding to last week's strong gains but the tech-heavy NASDAQ extending the sharp pullback seen last Friday. The Dow added 190.87 points or 0.76 percent to 25,461.70, while the NASDAQ fell 28.14 points or 0.38 percent to 7,328.85 and the S&P 500 gained 15.25 points or 0.56 percent to 2,738.31. A notable drop by Apple (AAPL) weighed on the NASDAQ after a report from Japan'sNikkei newspaper said demand for the company's iPhone XR appears to be disappointing. Overall trading was subdued, with traders reluctant to make significant moves ahead of today's midterm elections, which will decide control of both the House and Senate. Democrats are seen as having a better chance to claim a majority in the House, which would allow them to hinder President Donald Trump's agenda. The Federal Reserve's looming monetary policy announcement on Thursday also kept traders on the sidelines. While the Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged, traders will keep a close eye on the accompanying statement for clues about an expected rate hike in December. Crude oil futures eased Monday, after having moved up earlier in the day as U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil and came into force. Crude oil futures for December ended down $0.04 or less than 0.1 percent at $63.10 a barrel. Closer to home, Indonesia will provide Q3 numbers for gross domestic product later today; in the three months prior, GDP was up 4.21 percent on quarter and 5.27 percent on year.

 By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Asian shares ticked up in early Tuesday trade, supported by Wall Street gains although sentiment was tempered ahead of the U.S. midterm elections, the first major electoral test of President Donald Trump's big tax cuts and hostile trade policies. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  rose 0.15 percent while Japan's Nikkei  gained 0.5 percent, a day after both fell more than one percent. In oil markets, crude prices wobbled near multi-month lows after the United States granted eight countries temporary waivers allowing them to continue buying oil from Iran as Washington formally imposed punitive sanctions on the Islamic republic. Bucking broader gains, the Nasdaq Composite  fell 0.38 percent as Apple Inc  lost 2.8 percent following a Nikkei report that said the company had told its smartphone assemblers to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to the iPhone XR.  Ahead of Tuesday's U.S. elections, investors generally expect opposition Democrats to take over the House of Representatives while Trump's Republican Party is tipped to retain the Senate. While political gridlock between the White House and Congress could hinder Trump's pro-business agenda and raise political instability, including hearings centring on the administration, some analysts say such an outcome may have already been priced in by investors. If the Republicans retain their House majority, global stocks are likely to rally on hopes of more tax cuts. Trump said last month his administration planned to produce a resolution calling for a 10 percent tax cut for middle-income households.  "Everyone still remembers strong equity rallies after Trump was elected two years ago. So initially stock markets will gain," said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. "But further tax cuts would boost already large fiscal deficits and push the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield above its October high almost instantly. Given rises in U.S. bond yields triggered a correction in equities last month, any rally in stocks is unlikely to last long," he added. Many investors also expect Trump to continue to take a hard line on trade, regardless of the outcome of the elections. In oil markets, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude  futures slipped 0.3 percent to $62.86 a barrel after hitting a seven-month low of $62.52 on Monday. Major currencies, moves were modest. The euro traded at $1.1410, about one cent above this year's low of $1.1301 touched on Aug. 15. The yen  changed hands at 113.22 per dollar, near its three-week low of 113.385 marked last Wednesday. The British pound  touched a two-week high of $1.3070 and last stood at $1.3065. 
 
 
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe selloff in equity markets reversed course for a few days thanks to a flurry of strong earnings reports towards the end of October and into the beginning of November, coupled with a strong October jobs report and positive developments on trade relations between the U.S. and China. But, that brief recovery in stocks was short-circuited by a mixed earnings report from the world's biggest publicly traded company: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ).On Thursday evening, Apple reported mixed fourth-quarter numbers that beat on top and bottom line estimates but pointed to slowing growth and weakness ahead. Investors didn't respond well to the report. Apple stock dropped 7% to levels not seen since early August.But, Apple's fourth-quarter report wasn't all bad. Like most earnings reports, there was some good and some bad. The market is understandably focusing on the bad right now. Ultimately, though, investors shouldn't overthink this selloff.Broadly speaking, you have a really strong company still growing at a robust rate, with a stock that is trading at an exceptionally reasonable valuation. The stock hasn't really been hammered recently while its FANG peers have dropped into bear market territory. Thus, weakness on a mixed Q4 report is reasonable. But, because the fundamentals remain strong and the valuation remains reasonable, this weakness will not last.Instead, you'll get some consolidation around the $200 level, and then the rally will resume.There was a lot of good about Apple's Q4 report. The company beat both top and bottom line expectations, driven by healthier than expected revenue growth trends and better than expected expense control. iPhone average selling prices rose by a whole bunch and topped expectations, implying strong demand for Apple's new slate of $1,000-plus iPhones. Huge ASP growth drove iPhone revenues to a record high for the September quarter.Meanwhile, Mac sales were strong across the board. ASPs were healthy and largely in-line with expectations. Unit shipments blew past expectations. Total revenue did, too.The Services business, although it missed expectations by a hair, still grew at a robust 27% rate. This is consistent with the big but gradually slowing growth rates this business has reported over the past several years. Thus, in the big picture, still-robust 27% growth in Services is a material positive.The Other Products segment reported revenue growth of 31%, which is the same as last quarter, implying that demand for Apple's new products like Apple Watch continues to remain red hot.On the geography side, Apple touted strength in its China business. Many bears expected the China business to be weak. It did grow at a slower rate this quarter (16%) than last quarter (19%). But, at the beginning of this fiscal year and in the year-ago quarter, the China business was barely growing above 10%. Thus, in that context, 16% China growth is quite healthy.There was also a fair amount of bad in Apple's Q4 report. IPhone shipments yet again missed estimates. This is becoming the new norm. Apple misses iPhone shipment expectations but tops ASP expectations and overall drives record revenues. This seems like a fine combination. But, iPhone unit growth is flat year-over-year, implying global smartphone market saturation. Eventually, ASPs will max out, too, so the iPhone business is increasingly looking like a mature business with limited growth potential.The iPad business essentially missed expectations across the board. That isn't a big deal. But, it does show that Apple's hardware business continues to be lumpy.Meanwhile, the holiday quarter guide was weaker on both the revenue and margin front. Management blames the weak guide on emerging market weakness and FX headwinds. The FX headwinds are manageable. Emerging market weakness is not. The India business was flat in the quarter. That should be a huge growth business, given rapid urbanization and digitization trends in that economy. If this emerging market weakness persists, then Apple could lose some of its biggest growth drivers.Also, the company said that starting in the December quarter, they will no longer be providing unit sales data for the iPhone, iPad and Mac. This is pretty shocking. Analysts and investors have long used unit shipment data from those three products, especially the iPhone, to judge the underlying health of the company. Removing this financial health gauge from the market is a negative shock to investors.Overall, Apple's fourth-quarter report had some good and some bad. Ultimately, though, this story is all about favorable pricing trends, new hardware growth, Services growth, international expansion and stabilizing trends in the mature hardware business.Apple checked off all those boxes in the quarter. ASPs rose by a bunch everywhere. New hardware products reported robust growth. The Services business stayed on its 20%-plus growth trajectory. China is still growing at a healthy rate. And the iPhone business is stable in terms of units.Meanwhile, Apple stock now trades at just 15X forward earnings. That is fairly normal for this stock. As such, Apple stock is now a case of strong fundamentals converging on a reasonable valuation, and that makes this stock attractive at current levels.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AAPL.  The post Don't Overthink This Selloff in Apple Stock appeared first on InvestorPlace .
 Following   fiscal fourth-quarter results    ,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) has now filed its related annual form 10-K   with the SEC. The document always includes additional tidbits not   included in its earnings release, including its forecast for   capital expenditures in the next fiscal year. Total capital   expenditures for 2018 came in higher than expected, but the Mac   maker is predicting that 2019 capital spending will decline   compared to last fiscal year.Apple is guiding for fiscal 2019 capital expenditures of $14   billion.  Apple Piazza Liberty. Image source: Apple.The company ended up spending a record $16.7 billion in   capital expenditures for fiscal 2018, slightly higher than the   $16 billion it had initially expected    . For context, that's more than the   $15.5 billion    that   Intel    expects to spend in 2018. That was actually the first time in   years that Apple spent more than it anticipated, with 2012 being   the last fiscal year that capital expenditures exceeded its   guidance.  Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Fiscal years     shown.Generally speaking, the bulk of Apple's capital expenditures   are for product tooling and manufacturing infrastructure, in   addition to data centers and other corporate facilities. Apple   Park, the company's shiny new corporate headquarters that cost an   estimated $5 billion, was completed in early 2017, so those costs   are not included in fiscal 2018.However, Apple did announce earlier this year that it was   building a new corporate campus    , which will initially be for technical support. Apple also   spends hundreds of millions of dollars per year on renovating and   opening retail stores around the world, such as the Piazza   Liberty location in Milan (pictured above).Apple has launched or unveiled a wide range of newly designed   products in recent weeks, including new iPhones, Apple Watches,   iPad Pros    , and more. Redesigned products always entail significant   investments in manufacturing infrastructure, so the   higher-than-expected fiscal 2018 capital spending is attributable   to the sheer breadth of new products that Apple has launched over   the past year. New gadgets always start at the height of their   cost curves, and it shows here.Fortunately, tax reform has unlocked Apple's overseas cash   hoard, giving it greater access to all of its capital. It won't   need to issue debt to fund its capital return program or domestic   capital expenditures.The relative decline in Apple's forecast also suggests it   won't have as many redesigned products over the next year, and   will instead mostly lean on existing designs while periodically   bumping internal specs. Given how much of its portfolio has been   revamped over the past year, the company should be able to get   several good years out of those form factors.

Is Amazon Stock Still Worth a Buy?
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere are two ways to look at the recent price action in Amazon  (NASDAQ: AMZN ) stock. Amazon stock has bounced over 10% in the last few sessions, but that followed a 28% plunge in the stock from its early September highs above $2,000 to a six-month low below $1,500.From one standpoint, the sell-off seems like a badly needed correction from a market that had lost its sense. And after the bounce, the AMZN stock price could - and maybe even should - have further to fall. With AMZN stock still at 62x next year's consensus earnings estimates, it still looks overvalued.But I've long argued that investors can't just focus on the P/E multiple assigned to Amazon stock and call it overvalued. Without exaggeration, this is one of the best growth stories of all time (and perhaps the best). Amazon's opportunity continues to get larger. And while the sell-off in Amazon stock probably was overdue, it also provides yet another opportunity to participate in the long-term story here.The AMZN stock price has struggled since the market first assigned the company a $1 trillion valuation back in early September. Heading into those highs, even I questioned how much further the stock had to go.But I admittedly didn't see the correction coming so quickly nor did I see it cutting so deeply. A nervous market sold off Amazon stock and then disappointing Q3 revenue and Q4 guidance dropped the stock another 8%.All that said, it's important not to overreact here. As impressive as the long-term chart of AMZN is, there have been some stumbles along the way. Amazon stock lost a quarter of its value in the last two months of 2011. The stock sold off for most of 2014, again falling about 25% in the first ten months of that year. In the market-wide correction of early 2016, the AMZN stock price dropped almost 30%.We've seen these corrections before. Historically, they've provided buying opportunities. That's not a guarantee that this time, too, AMZN will rebound. Past performance does not guarantee future results, after all. Still, history suggests Amazon stock will bounce back, and so do the numbers.Amazon stock already has recaptured its post-earnings losses, which makes some sense. News in the quarter was mixed at worst, and as noted, the stock already had sold off before the report.Even in a "disappointing" quarter, revenue still rose 29% year-over-year, an astounding growth rate. Amazon Web Services revenue jumped another 46% year-over-year. Growth rates from rivals Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) suggest some share gains, but AWS remains the dominant provider in a profitable and fast-growing industry.Amazon Business is at a $10 billion annual run rate in terms of revenue. A new line of Echo products should add to the reach of Alexa, which seems to be outperforming Google Assistant and Siri, from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). And no one is really threatening the core consumer retail e-commerce business here.Q4 guidance does look disappointing. A guided range of 10-20% year-over-year growth came in below expectations and suggests a surprising amount of uncertainty toward the key holiday quarter. But, as management explained on the Q3 call, Amazon is lapping the Whole Foods acquisition, and has a comparison against a very strong quarter from a year ago. With so much of the company's sales coming toward the end of the quarter, the wide range of guidance makes some sense as well.All told, this isn't a quarter that changes the long-term outlook for Amazon as a business. Nor is it a report that supports a nearly 30% reduction in the AMZN stock price, even when you consider that the stock might have run too far this summer.AMZN isn't cheap, but it shouldn't be. And while headline P/E multiples suggest Amazon stock could fall further, a closer look shows that Amazon can easily grow into its current valuation.Notably, in terms of free cash flow, AMZN's valuation is more reasonable. Amazon stock now trades at 51x trailing twelve-month free cash flow after more than 100% growth in that figure over the past year.And while Q3 revenue numbers disappointed, earnings beat handily. And that shows that Amazon's narrow margins are starting to show some expansion after being pressured by years of investment. Operating income rose more than 10x year-over-year in Q3; it has more than quadrupled year-to-date.Yet, so far this year, margins remain in the 5% range. Continued leveraging of operating expenses and/or moderating investment spend can add a couple of hundred basis points to that figure. Add in revenue growth, and there's a clear path for Amazon earnings and cash flow to double, or come close to doubling, in a matter of years.With some patience, then, an investor can own AMZN at a sub-30x multiple to free cash flow. For one of the world's great growth stories, that's a very attractive offer. And it's why, like so many sell-offs in the past, the plunge in AMZN is a buying opportunity.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post Is Amazon Stock Still Worth a Buy? appeared first on InvestorPlace .

  (RTTNews.com) - The Taiwan stock market on Monday wrote a finish to the five-day winning streak in which it had advanced more than 410 points or 4.3 percent. The Taiwan Stock Exchange now rests just beneath the 9,890-point plateau and it's looking at another soft start again on Tuesday. The global forecast for the Asian markets is murky ahead of U.S. midterm elections later today as weakness from oil and technology stocks will likely cap any upside. The European and U.S. markets were mixed and little changed and the Asian bourses figure to open in similar fashion. The TSE finished slightly lower on Monday as losses from the technology stocks and cement companies were mitigated by support from the financials and plastics. For the day, the index dipped 16.78 points or 0.17 percent to finish at the daily high of 9,889.81 after moving as low as 9,786.25 on turnover of 102.88 billion Taiwan dollars. Among the actives, United Microelectronics Corporation plummeted 9.66 percent, while AsusTek Computer dropped 1.69 percent, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company shed 0.63 percent, AU Optronics slid 0.43 percent, Largan Precision tumbled 2.55 percent, Hon Hai Precision skidded 1.23 percent, Taiwan Cement plunged 3.02 percent, Asia Cement plummeted 4.84 percent, China Steel advanced 0.83 percent, Formosa Plastics jumped 1.98 percent, Cathay Financial gained 0.20 percent, Fubon Financial added 0.61 percent, CTBC Financial eased 0.24 percent, Yuanta Financial collected 0.99 percent, Mega Financial was up 0.19 percent and Chunghwa Telecom dipped 0.47 percent. The lead from Wall Street provides little clarity as stocks moved in opposite directions on Monday, with the Dow and the S&P 500 adding to last week's strong gains but the tech-heavy NASDAQ extending the sharp pullback seen last Friday. The Dow added 190.87 points or 0.76 percent to 25,461.70, while the NASDAQ fell 28.14 points or 0.38 percent to 7,328.85 and the S&P 500 gained 15.25 points or 0.56 percent to 2,738.31. A notable drop by Apple (AAPL) weighed on the NASDAQ after a report from Japan'sNikkei newspaper said demand for the company's iPhone XR appears to be disappointing. Overall trading was subdued, with traders reluctant to make significant moves ahead of today's midterm elections, which will decide control of both the House and Senate. Democrats are seen as having a better chance to claim a majority in the House, which would allow them to hinder President Donald Trump's agenda. The Federal Reserve's looming monetary policy announcement on Thursday also kept traders on the sidelines. While the Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged, traders will keep a close eye on the accompanying statement for clues about an expected rate hike in December. Crude oil futures eased Monday, after having moved up earlier in the day as U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil and came into force. Crude oil futures for December ended down $0.04 or less than 0.1 percent at $63.10 a barrel. For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com

Free Lunch is available on YouTube, Facebook Live, Twitter, Ustream, and more.U.S. stocks were mixed in morning trading Monday, as uncertainty over the midterm elections and pressure on the market's tech behemoths weighed on investors.The latest opinion polls show that there is a strong chance we wind up with a split Congress tomorrow, with Democrats reclaiming a majority in the House and Republicans maintaining a lead in the Senate. This outcome is still far from certain, however, and recent surprise elections have reminded voters that races are not over until all the votes are tallied.It is unclear whether Wall Street is hoping for one result or another in the midterms; rather, it is possible that investors and traders simply want to move past the uncertainty and noise that is the elections.Another political headline adding volatility to the stock market is the ongoing trade drama between the U.S. and China. Last week's rebound ended abruptly Friday, as mixed reports from the White House in regards to the progress of a deal with Beijing sent stocks through the ringer. It does seem like officials will hold more talks soon, but the possibility of an agreement before the New Year is still unknown.Moreover, Apple AAPL  shares were down in morning trading Monday as the iPhone maker continued its post-earnings selloff. Fears that Apple will struggle to generate growth from the iPhone segment were underscored this morning by a report that said the company has instructed suppliers to stop adding production lines for the new iPhone XR.This low-cost option was meant to provide a middle tier for potential iPhone upgraders, but if these rumors are true, it looks as if users are opting for cheaper outdated models instead. This raised questions about Apple's plan to gradually increase the average selling price of the iPhone.Apple's volatility spread to the rest of the FAANGs in early trading, as Facebook FB  , Amazon AMZN  , Netflix NFLX  , and Alphabet GOOGL  all dipped into the red.On today's Free Lunch, Ryan and Dave chat about all of these stories.

 Shares of Apple AAPL  were down more than 4% in early morning trading Monday, adding to the iPhone maker's post-earnings selloff and underscoring fears about the performance of its key business segment.Some of Apple's sluggishness today can be pegged on a report from Nikkei Asian Review that suggested  the tech behemoth has narrowed its sales expectations for the new iPhone XR. Specifically, Nikkei said that Apple has told two of its suppliers, Foxconn and Pegatron, to stop adding production lines for the low-cost model.The report indicated that Foxxconn is running at about 75% capacity on explicit orders from Apple, translating to about 100,000 fewer phones per day. The same sentiment has been expressed to Pegatron, Nikkei said.However, the publication did say that Apple is upping its quarterly production goal for older models-such as the 8 and 8 Plus-to 25 million units from 20 million units. The iPhone 8 line currently sells for about 20% less than the XR, according to the report.As total iPhone sales plateau, investors have circled the average selling price of the marquee device as a key area for growth from Apple. The higher price tag of the iPhone X line delivers that growth, and to see shoppers opting for outdated models that are multiple steps down in terms of price is likely a point of concern for Wall Street.This news punctuated Apple's second analyst downgrade since its earnings announcement last week. The most recent downgrade comes from Rosenblatt Securities, which lowered its rating on Apple shares to neutral from buy and warned that it would be challenging for the company to offset weaker iPhone sales volume with higher prices in the second half of 2019."Calendar fourth-quarter guidance reflects our cautious view on weaker than expected sell-through and production reductions for iPhone XS/XR," wrote Rosenblatt's Jun Zhang in a note Friday.   Apple topped expectations in its most recent quarterly earnings report, but the company guided on the soft end for the holiday quarter, sending the stock sharply lower on Friday. Management also announced that it would no longer release unit sales for specific products like the iPhone, adding to concerns that growth in the core business is getting harder to find.Consensus estimates have Apple's current quarter earnings per share and revenue sitting at $4.77 and $91.32 billion, respectively. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of 23% and 3%.Apple has witnessed two negative revisions and one positive revision to its EPS estimates for this period within the past week. These adjustments have pushed the consensus two cents lower in that time. Nevertheless, a more positive estimate trend for future periods has kept the stock at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Major Averages Close Mixed As Nasdaq Extends Pullback - U.S. Commentary
  (RTTNews.com) - Stocks moved in opposite directions during trading on Monday, with the Dow and the S&P 500 adding to last week's strong gains but the tech-heavy Nasdaq extending the sharp pullback seen last Friday. The major averages ended the day mixed, as the Nasdaq climbed off its worst levels but still closed down 28.14 points or 0.4 percent at 7,328.85. The Dow advanced 190.87 points or 0.8 percent to 25,461.70 and the S&P 500 climbed 15.25 points or 0.6 percent to 2,738.31. A notable drop by Apple ( AAPL ) weighed on the Nasdaq, with the tech giant slumping by 2.8 percent to a three-month closing low. Apple extended the sell-off seen in the previous session after a report from Japan'sNikkei newspaper said demand for the company's iPhone XR appears to be disappointing. Online retail giant Amazon (AMZN) also came under pressure after President Donald Trump told Axios his administration is looking into antitrust violations by the company. Overall trading was somewhat subdued, however, with traders reluctant to make significant moves ahead of Tuesday's highly anticipated midterm elections, which will decide control of both the House and Senate. Democrats are seen as having a much better chance to claim a majority in the House than in the Senate, but controlling the lower chamber would still allow Democrats to hinder Trump's agenda. The Federal Reserve's looming monetary policy announcement also kept some traders on the sidelines, with the Fed due to announce is latest decision on Thursday. While the Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged, traders will keep a close eye on the accompanying statement for clues about an expected rate hike in December. Meanwhile, traders largely shrugged off a report from the Institute for Supply Management showing a modest slowdown in the pace of growth in the service sector in the month of October. The ISM said its non-manufacturing index dipped to 60.3 in October after climbing to 61.6 in September, although a reading above 50 still indicates growth in the service sector. Economists had expected the index to drop to 59.3. Last month, the ISM said the non-manufacturing index unexpectedly rose in September, reaching its highest level since the inception of the composite index in 2008. Sector News Natural gas stocks showed a substantial move to the upside on the day, driving the NYSE Arca Natural Gas Index up by 4 percent. With the jump, the index climbed further off the more than two-year closing low set last Monday. The rally by natural gas stocks came amid a sharp increase by the price of the commodity, with natural gas for December delivery surging up $0.283 to $3.567 per million BTUs. Significant strength was also visible among tobacco stocks, as reflected by the 3 percent spike by the NYSE Arca Tobacco Index. Oil and oil service, pharmaceutical, commercial real estate and utilities stocks also saw notable strength on the day, while semiconductor stocks moved to the downside. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved notably lower during trading on Monday. Japan'sNikkei 225 Index tumbled by 1.6 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index plunged by 2.1 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets turned in a mixed performance on the day. While the U.K.'sFTSE 100 Index inched up by 0.1 percent, the French CAC 40 Index closed just below the unchanged and the German DAX Index edged down by 0.2 percent. In the bond market, treasuries regained some ground after moving notably lower last Friday. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, dipped by 1.3 basis points to 3.201 percent. Looking Ahead Traders may stick to the sidelines amid a quiet day on the U.S. economic front on Tuesday as they await the results of the midterm elections. On the earnings front, Avis Budget (CAR), Marriott (MAR), Pandora Media (P), Rent-A-Center (RCII), and Tenet Health (THC) are among the companies releasing their quarter results after the close of today's trading. Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), CVS Health (CVS), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Ralph Lauren (RL) are also among the companies due to report their results before the start of trading on Tuesday.

  Skyworks Solutions Inc. SWKS  is set to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 8. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording average positive surprise of 3.59%.In the last reported quarter, the company's non-GAAP earnings of $1.64 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a nickel. The figure improved 4.5% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues of $894.3 million were down 0.7% year over year, primarily owing to weakness in mobile business and loss of ZTE revenues (which usually contributes $25-$30 million per quarter). However, the revenue figure was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Notably, Skyworks is benefiting from its portfolio strength, particularly in the 5G applications and Internet-of-Things (IoT) market. Guidance & Estimates For fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues are expected to increase 11-13% sequentially or $1 billion at mid-point. Management expects couple of million dollars in revenues from ZTE. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be $1.91 per share, up 16% sequentially, at mid-point.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at $1.91 per share, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 4.9%. Further, Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1 billion, up roughly 1.7% from the year-ago quarter.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Factors to Influence Q4 Results The emergence of connected homes, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality, wearables and network infrastructure presents significant growth opportunity for Skyworks' connectivity solutions.Recently, Skyworks unveiled solutions from its Sky5 platform that has been authorized to support wireless 5G networks. Further, the company continues to win content at mobile and OEMs like Huawei, Samsung, Oppo, Vivo, LG and Nokia. Notably, the upcoming 5G upgrade cycle is also a major positive.The company also launched street lighting modules with Philips for smart cities and introduced networking products supporting AT&T/DIRECTV routers.Skyworks also launched high-precision GPS functionality improving ride-sharing, mobile payment and fleet management services in the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, the company inked partnership with Sierra Wireless on LTE CAT-12 data cards for M2M applications.Notably, during the last reported quarter, mobile contributed almost 70% of revenues, while the rest came from broad markets. Further, China contributes almost 25-30% of revenues, majority of which is contributed by mobile.All these factors bode well for the company and are likely to act as tailwinds in the to-be reported quarter.In terms of competition, management believes that Qualcomm (QCOM), despite pursuing programs that Skyworks is already a part of, is not a major threat. Moreover, the trade war between the United States and China will not have much impact on the company's top-line.However, the near-term softness witnessed across leading smart-phone customers remains a headwind. Overdependence on Apple AAPL  for revenue generation continues to add to the woes.Nonetheless, management remains optimistic on Skyworks' expanding product portfolio and new customer wins to keep revenues churning and help its gross margins improve.

 By Sinéad Carew NEW YORK, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose on Monday, as oil prices lifted energy stocks and defensive sectors such as utilities and real estate were in demand as investors were cautious about Iran sanctions and U.S. congressional elections.

 On July 12,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) announced   updated versions of its high-end MacBook Pro   computers    with significantly improved internals. The systems incorporate   faster processors -- Apple claimed a 70% boost on the 15-inch   model and a doubling in performance for the 13-inch variant -- as   well as support for greater memory (32 GB of DRAM from a 16 GB   maximum in the prior model). The systems also incorporate Apple's   T2 companion chip as well as True Tone display technology.In the 13-inch models, Apple uses the Iris Plus graphics that   are integrated inside of the   Intel    processors, but for the 15-inch systems, Apple uses discrete   graphics processors from   Advanced Micro Devices    (NASDAQ: AMD) . The versions that Apple announced back in July --   and the ones that are available for sale -- can currently be   configured with AMD's Radeon Pro 555X graphics or a higher-end   version known as Radeon Pro 560X. These are both based on the   company's older,   lower-end Polaris architecture    .  The 15-inch MacBook Pro. Image source: Apple.Apple recently announced that, beginning in late November, it   would allow buyers to configure the 15-inch MacBook Pro with   AMD's newly announced Radeon Pro Vega 16 or its higher-end   counterpart, Radeon Pro Vega 20 -- higher-end graphics processors   compared with the Polaris-based Radeon Pro 555X and 560X   parts.Let's go over what this means for both Apple and AMD.To the extent that it can sell more expensive systems, Apple's   Mac-related revenue and, presumably, profit stand to benefit.When I go to Apple's website, the company lets customers   choose from two 15-inch MacBook Pro systems to customize. The   first comes with a 2.2 GHz six-core CPU, Radeon Pro 555X, and 256   GB of storage starting at $2,399. The second has a faster   six-core CPU running at a base speed of 2.6 GHz, Radeon Pro 560X   graphics, and 512 GB of storage for $2,799.The $2,399 model can only be configured with up to the Radeon   Pro 560X, which means that anybody who wants to get their hands   on a Radeon Pro Vega-based MacBook Pro will also have to buy a   system that fundamentally starts at a higher price. That's a   clear win for Apple.As far as AMD is concerned, keep in mind that every time Apple   sells a 15-inch MacBook Pro, AMD already gets a graphics chip   sale. The difference now is that if a customer picks a MacBook   Pro with a Radeon Pro Vega, not only should Apple benefit by   selling a pricier system, but AMD should benefit, too, by selling   a pricier graphics processor.Apple offering higher-end configurations of its MacBook Pro   with AMD's Radeon Pro Vega graphics chips is a nice way for Apple   and AMD to sell pricier systems and graphics chips, respectively,   but this isn't a game changer for either company.Remember that during its fiscal year 2018, Apple shipped   around 18.2 million total Macs.

 By Imani Moise NEW YORK, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Cogni Inc, a New York-based digital banking start-up that wants to hold deposits for consumers and book their hotels, flights and movie tickets, recently closed a $1.7 million seed funding round as it prepares to launch. The two-year old company, which is 2 percent owned by Barclays Plc, has also hired a boutique merchant bank to advise its Series A funding, which is typically the first significant round of venture capital financing. Many fintech companies are hesitant to apply for the charter because none have been awarded yet and no one wants to be the test subject. "We are not innovating a lot within the financial services space but we are innovating a lot in the lifestyle space," he said in an interview. While traditional banks make money by collecting cash from depositors and lending it out at a higher rate to borrowers, Cogni will derive a significant amount of revenue from partnerships with companies that are offering products and services to its customers. Brands are attracted to Cogni because traditional advertising has not been effective with younger consumers who are constantly bombarded with marketing, Ravishankar said. Though not yet common in the United States, Cogni's single payment and commerce platform where you make purchases on the same app where you manage your cash is popular outside the United States with such apps as WeChat. "There is a huge benefit for the merchants," he said. The MyCogni app has been tested with a few hundred users in the United States or the past two months. It offers a debit card with up to 12 percent cash back on purchases at over 160,000 retailers and allows customers, such as a freelancer, to send invoices, and divide up their cash into personalized payment and savings buckets. Ravishankar says about 30,000 people have expressed interest in signing up for the early 2019 launch. The Cogni stake is the latest in Barclay' investments in U.S. fintech companies as it expand in the market. The European bank has been paying highly competitive rates for deposits on U.S. savings accounts and recently started offering personal loans. Earlier this year, Barclays announced a partnership with PayPal Holdings Inc  to gain market share in the $1.8 trillion global payments industry, where Amazon.com Inc  and Apple Inc  are quickly picking up steam. 
 
 By Sruthi Shankar Nov 5 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose on Monday, supported by gains in energy stocks and strong results from Berkshire Hathaway Inc, while the Nasdaq was dragged down by a 3 percent drop in Apple Inc shares. The iPhone maker's shares  were on track for their worst two-day decline since January 2013, after the Nikkei reported that the company had told smartphone assemblers to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to the iPhone XR.  The energy sector, which has lagged the broader S&P 500  this year, was up 1.4 percent as the United States imposed a range of punitive sanctions on Iran, lifting oil prices by about 1 percent.  Chevron rose 3.8 percent, providing the biggest boost to the Dow, while EQT Corp  and Cabot Oil  were the top gainers on the S&P 500, rising 6.5 percent and 4.9 percent, respectively. Gains in defensive sectors, including real estate, utilities  and consumer staples, helped the markets rebound at the start of a packed week, which will see the U.S. midterm elections and a Federal Reserve meeting. "One thing we're seeing right now at a market level and a sector level is that volatility begets volatility. The fact that somebody moves up and down is more about what's happened recently in terms of the size of those moves," said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. "Tech stocks, by and large, were the last bastion of strength and you could argue that there is further room for them to catch down to some of the broader indexes."

 By Akanksha Rana Nov 5 Reuters - Apple Inc  has told its smartphone assemblers Foxconn and Pegatron  to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to its new iPhone XR, the Nikkei financial daily on Monday (graphic). Apple shares fell nearly 4 percent after the report, which fueled concerns that the iPhone XR, the cheapest of three iPhones Apple unveiled in September, was facing weak demand just days after it hit shelves. "For the Foxconn side, it first prepared nearly 60 assembly lines for Apple's XR model, but recently uses only around 45 production lines as its top customer said it does not need to manufacture that many by now," the Nikkei quoted one source as saying. Apple is considered the biggest customer for Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Apple did not respond to Reuters' request for comment, while Foxconn and Pegatron each said they would not comment on specific customers or products. The Nikkei's report comes days after Cupertino, California-based Apple warned that sales for the crucial holiday quarter would likely miss Wall Street expectations.  "If the reports are accurate, we do find it somewhat disturbing that this would take place so early after the launch of the iPhone XR," said Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA. "We did not witness any notable order push-outs for the iPhone XR after the initial week of its launch, which is the first time we can say that about a new phone release that took place in the fall," Zino added. The decline in Apple's stock was "way overdone and undeserved," said Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth. "History has shown all kinds of statements made about Apple supply chain and the endless predictions of slowing of iPhone and other Apple product sales have been wrong," said Feinseth, who rates Apple's stock a "strong buy." The Nikkei reported in June that Apple expected to ship about 20 percent fewer iPhones this year compared with the same time last year.  In 2016, Apple introduced a cheaper iPhone called the SE, at a starting price of $399, but failed to lure more customers to buy that product. Separately, Apple's stock was downgraded for a second time since its earnings report, this time by Rosenblatt Securities, which said it has lowered its expectations for iPhone production and shipments, CNBC on Monday. 
 
  (RTTNews.com) - After moving in opposite directions early in the session, stocks continue to turn in a mixed performance in mid-day trading on Monday. The Dow and the S&P 500 are adding to last week's strong gains, but the tech-heavy Nasdaq is extending the sharp pullback seen last Friday. While, the Nasdaq is down 66.53 points or 0.9 percent at 7,290.47, the Dow is up 156.58 points or 0.6 percent at 25,427.41 and the S&P 500 is up 8.48 points or 0.3 percent at 2,731.54. A drop by Apple ( AAPL ) is weighing on the Nasdaq, with the tech giant down by 2.8 percent after hitting a new three-month intraday low. Apple is extending the sell-off seen in the previous session after a report from Japan'sNikkei newspaper said demand for the company's iPhone XR appears to be disappointing. Online retail giant Amazon (AMZN) is also posting a notable loss after President Donald after Trump told Axios his administration is looking into antitrust violations by the online retail giant. Overall trading is somewhat subdued, however, with traders reluctant to make significant moves ahead of the highly anticipated midterm elections on Tuesday, which will decide control of both the House and Senate. Democrats are seen as having a much better chance to claim a majority in the House than in the Senate, but controlling the lower chamber would still allow Democrats to hinder Trump's agenda. The Federal Reserve's looming monetary policy announcement is also keeping some traders on the sidelines, with the Fed due to announce is latest decision on Thursday. While the Fed is widely expected to lead interest rates unchanged, traders will keep a close eye on the accompanying statement for clues about an expected rate hike in December. Meanwhile, traders have largely shrugged off a report from the Institute for Supply Management showing a modest slowdown in the pace of growth in the service sector in the month of October. The ISM said its non-manufacturing index dipped to 60.3 in October after climbing to 61.6 in September, although a reading above 50 still indicates growth in the service sector. Economists had expected the index to drop to 59.3. Last month, the ISM said the non-manufacturing index unexpectedly rose in September, reaching its highest level since the inception of the composite index in 2008. Sector News Natural gas stocks have shown a substantial move to the upside on the day, driving the NYSE Arca Natural Gas Index up by 3.4 percent. With the jump, the index is climbing further off the more than two-year closing low set last Monday. The rally by natural gas stocks comes amid a sharp increase by the price of the commodity, with natural gas for December delivery surging up $0.267 to $3.551 per million BTUs. Significant strength is also visible among tobacco stocks, as reflected by the 2.7 percent spike by the NYSE Arca Tobacco Index. Oil and oil service stocks are also seeing notable strength amid an increase by the price of crude oil, moving higher along with utilities, commercial real estate, and pharmaceutical stocks. On the other hand, considerable weakness among semiconductor and computer hardware stocks is helping to keep the tech-heavy Nasdaq in negative territory. Reflecting the weakness in the sectors, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index and the NYSE Arca Computer Hardware Index are down by 1.9 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved notably lower during trading on Monday. Japan'sNikkei 225 Index tumbled by 1.6 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index plunged by 2.1 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets turn in a mixed performance on the day. While the U.K.'sFTSE 100 Index inched up by 0.1 percent, the French CAC 40 Index closed just below the unchanged and the German DAX Index edged down by 0.2 percent. In the bond market, treasuries are regaining some ground after moving notably lower last Friday. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is down by 2.3 basis points at 3.191 percent. For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com 
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMeh. The market may have logged a loss on Friday, with the S&P 500 falling 0.65%. But, after three days of sizeable gains that appear to have snapped the downtrend, most traders were OK with the bit of profit-taking headed into the weekend.Besides, a huge part of the pullback was attributed to one company. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), still the world's biggest company, was off to the tune of 6.6% following its fiscal-fourth-quarter report that was less than hoped. But, the bulk of the revolt might have had more to do with the fact that the company is no longer going to report iPhone unit sales .AcelRx Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ACRX ) was up 15.6% mostly on news that its opioid pain drug has been approved by the FDA , Though investors may have also bought in before the company's post-close release of its third-quarter numbers .There just weren't enough names like ACRX to lift the broad market out of the red.Headed into today's action following Friday's mostly uncommitted action, stock charts of Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ), Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI ) and Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) are shaping up as your best trading bets. Here's a look at what's already happened, and what's apt to happen next.Coca-Cola shares had been trapped in a trading range as of August, but that range was finally broken this week. Though we're still likely to see some back-and-forth action, a lot of hard work has been done, and the bulls have tipped their hand.And, when framing the near-term uptrend within the context of a much-bigger-picture trading pattern, the bullish argument is further bolstered.

  (RTTNews.com) - Stocks are turning in a mixed performance in morning trading on Monday, as the Dow and the S&P 500 are adding to last week's strong gains but the tech-heavy Nasdaq is extending the sharp pullback seen last Friday. Currently, the major averages remain on opposite sides of the unchanged line. While the Nasdaq is down 85.42 points or 1.2 percent at 7,271.57, the Dow is up 121.12 points or 0.5 percent at 25,391.95 and the S&P 500 is up 4.16 points or 0.2 percent at 2,727.22. A continued decline by Apple ( AAPL ) is weighing on the Nasdaq, with the tech giant tumbling by 4 percent to a new three-month intraday low. Apple is extending the sell-off seen in the previous session after a report from Japan'sNikkei newspaper said demand for the company's iPhone XR appears to be disappointing. Overall trading is somewhat subdued, however, with traders reluctant to make significant moves ahead of the highly anticipated midterm elections on Tuesday, which will decide control of both the House and Senate. Democrats are seen as having a much better chance to claim a majority in the House than in the Senate, but controlling the lower chamber would still allow Democrats to hinder President Donald Trump's agenda. The Federal Reserve's looming monetary policy announcement is also keeping some traders on the sidelines, with the Fed due to announce is latest decision on Thursday. While the Fed is widely expected to lead interest rates unchanged, traders will keep a close eye on the accompanying statement for clues about an expected rate hike in December. Meanwhile, traders have largely shrugged off a report from the Institute for Supply Management showing a modest slowdown in the pace of growth in the service sector in the month of October. The ISM said its non-manufacturing index dipped to 60.3 in October after climbing to 61.6 in September, although a reading above 50 still indicates growth in the service sector. Economists had expected the index to drop to 59.3. Last month, the ISM said the non-manufacturing index unexpectedly rose in September, reaching its highest level since the inception of the composite index in 2008. Natural gas stocks have moved sharply higher along with the price of the commodity, driving the NYSE Arca Natural Gas Index up by 3.4 percent. Tobacco stocks are also seeing substantial strength in morning trading, moving higher along with oil, commercial real estate, and pharmaceutical stocks. On the other hand, semiconductor stocks are seeing significant weakness, extending the pullback seen last Friday. Reflecting the weakness in the sector, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is down by 2.3 percent. Considerable weakness is also visible among retail stocks, with Amazon (AMZN) helping to lead the way lower after Trump said his administration is looking into antitrust violations by the online retail giant. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved notably lower during trading on Monday. Japan'sNikkei 225 Index tumbled by 1.6 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index plunged by 2.1 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets are turning in a mixed performance on the day. While the U.K.'sFTSE 100 Index is up by 0.2 percent, the French CAC 40 Index is down by 0.1 percent and the German DAX Index is down by 0.3 percent. In the bond market, treasuries are regaining some ground after moving notably lower last Friday. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is down by 2.3 basis points at 3.191 percent. For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com 
5 Top Stock Trades for Monday: Trading Apple, Starbucks Earnings
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter hearing no progress on the trade front for months, we're suddenly being hit with a deluge of positive news regarding U.S. and Chinese trade relations. Yeah, that's not fishy at all with the midterms just around the corner.In any regard, it's allowing stocks to buoy right below their 200-day moving averages, setting up the potential for major resistance should we not push through these marks next week. In that light, let's tackle our must-see stock charts.This Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) chart likely looks familiar to many investors, given that we laid out the setup ahead of the print to InvestorPlace readers. So where do we stand now?The truth is, Apple removed some transparency in its report and the midpoint of its guidance fell a bit short of consensus expectations. But with Buffett, and more importantly, Apple in there buying away, along with countless funds, how long can you bet against the iPhone maker?Services hit $10 billion in sales for the quarter and continues to grow at a 25%-plus clip. The hardware maker is becoming a software and services specialist - while making big-time margins on the hardware to boot. I'm not going to pound the table on Apple's fundamentals, I don't have that kind of room on a piece like this.But long story short, I want to buy dips rather than sell into the decline. We've broken out of the downtrend channel (purple lines) and will likely close below the 100-day. That sets us up for a retest of the 200-day.I'm going to be honest, I'm talking my book a bit right now, but that's only because the stocks happen to be the market's biggest names on Friday. I've owned Apple for a long, long time. I couldn't help but finally nibble some here near $207, as it rests on the backside of prior uptrend resistance (blue line).If it breaks below that, I'll be looking for a $190 to $195 test and to be honest, I really hope it happens.The other half to my book-talking special? Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ). It's my largest single-stock holding as well as my longest tenured position. I couldn't help but point out the relative strength constantly on Twitter , as well as here on InvestorPlace - actually, we nailed it here - as Starbucks continued to outperform last month. Shares actually rose in October, before exploding higher on earnings.So what now?After nearly hitting $66, most doubters are throwing in the towel. Bulls most certainly will want to see $60 hold as support, and even more so, $62 to $63. If we somehow get a dip down into the $57 to $58 range, investors would be crazy to take a pass.You know Bill Ackman will buy more if that's the case .I love AT&T (NYSE: T ) for its very solid dividend, a payout it's raised for more than 30 consecutive years. When it broke below $30 and hit $29, its yield neared 7%, a figure that has acted as support for AT&T over the past three decades. ( Here's the backstory to this dividend support ).Call me crazy, but I'm a buyer of a dependable yielder like that. But are we seeing $31 support turn into $31 resistance? That's what its post-earnings action is looking like.T is in a tricky spot for the bulls if they want anything more than yield out of the name. Should it hurdle $31, it has three major moving averages currently between $31.85 and $32.80. On the downside, should it break down, we could easily be looking at $30 or below.If so, look for support at $30 and again on the backside of prior downtrend resistance (blue line).GoPro (NYSE: GPRO ) snapped higher on the results from Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ), but tumbled 22% on Friday from its own results . It's now a no-touch.Shares plunged below $5.75 support, as well as all three major moving averages. Over $6 and the story changes, but we're far from that happening. It's in no man's land right now.Trading right near $48 and some investors are surely tempted to take a stab at Weight Watchers (NASDAQ: WTW ) - especially with the stock down 30% after earnings .I'm not so sure, though. On big down days like this, I like to give stocks a few days to settle down. If it chops near $48 and can get some buyers to step up, bulls can go long with a close below Friday's low as their stop-loss. However, if this level gives way, $40 could be on the table. Let's see how this one shakes out after a couple more days.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell .

 By Sruthi Shankar Nov 5 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were on course to open slightly lower on Monday, with little impetus moving markets ahead of crucial U.S. midterm elections and a Federal Reserve meeting this week. Opinion polls show a strong chance for President Donald Trump'sRepublican Party holding the Senate but losing control of the House of Representatives to the Democrats - a potential hurdle to Trump's pro-business agenda, which has been a major factor for the stock market's rally since the 2016 election.  "But in the short term, the market is going to react negatively because you're not going to see the kind of favorable legislation that you've been seeing in the past couple of years." With the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, investors are fretting over even tighter U.S. monetary policy, especially after a string of strong economic data, including Friday's jobs report. The upbeat report, however, did little to stop the U.S. market from snapping a three-day rally on Friday, following a bruising October, due to Apple Inc's  downbeat forecast and the White House dampening optimism over U.S.-China trade talks. "U.S. equity markets need to find traction for this attempt at a rebound higher that took shape last week. Three variables that could well play a hand in that this week are: corporate earnings, the FOMC and midterm elections," Peter Kenny, founder of Strategic Board Solutions in New York, wrote in a note. "However, I remain constructive." At 8:44 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis  were down 27 points, or 0.11 percent. S&P 500 e-minis  were down 1.75 points, or 0.06 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis  were down 18 points, or 0.26 percent. Apple's shares continued their decline on Monday, falling 1.7 percent in premarket trading after the Nikkei reported the company has told two smartphone assemblers to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to the low-cost iPhone XR.  Berkshire Hathaway,  rose 2.6 percent after the conglomerate run by billionaire Warren Buffett said its quarterly operating profit doubled.  Overall, third-quarter results have been stronger than expected, with about 78 percent of the companies so far beating analysts' estimates, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.

10 Tech Stocks That Pay You to Own Them
The name of the game in investing is "total return." When you buy a stock, your total return comes from two places - price appreciation and dividends. For the longest time tech stocks were never mentioned hand-in-hand with dividend stocks . Pick up Amazon.com ( AMZN ) for $300, sell half at a thousand bucks a few years later, and you're sitting on free shares worth $1,600 each a year after that. That's the blueprint!Many tech stocks used to offer share splits as their prices rocketed higher. However many technology companies are maturing, and with breakneck growth in the rear-view mirror, and they need a different way to draw investors. The answer, for many, has been to start delivering dividends, paying investors for owning their shares.To be clear, tech stocks that pay dividends aren't done growing. The increased presence of technology in all aspects of human life means that there's still plenty of upside, even for Wall Street's biggest tech companies. To wit, old-guard blue chip Microsoft ( MSFT ) has surpassed Google parent Alphabet ( GOOGL ) and Facebook ( FB ) in market value this year, and it's neck-and-neck with Amazon.Here are 10 tech stocks that offer an ideal combination of dividends and growth potential. They might not be the flashiest names in the sector, but they deserve attention nonetheless.Market value: $985 billionDividend yield: 1.3%Everybody loves Apple ( AAPL , $207.48). Warren Buffett loves Apple. President Donald Trump loves Apple. And a lot of investors made Apple - founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne - America's first $1 trillion company based on market capitalization.However, Apple recently has fallen into a significant funk and given up that $1 trillion price tag. It suffered its worst performance in more than four years on Friday, Nov. 2, in response to a quarterly earnings report that beat expectations, but included disappointing guidance and a revelation that Apple will no longer report unit sales in any of its products.That sparked immediate panic because the assumption is Apple expects less-than-impressive iPhone and other product sales going forward, even if margins continue to improve. That fear was further fueled by flat iPhone sales for the quarter.That said, there are reasons for optimism. For one, it appears Apple will shift its focus on its Services division (iTunes, Apple Pay, etc.), which has been a shining bright spot for the company over the past couple years. And some analysts believe this change in disclosure, while painful in the short-term, will benefit Apple over the long run.Also don't forget that Apple remains a cash-generating machine that, earlier this year, promised to buy back $100 billion stock and tacked on another 16% increase to the dividend. The payout has jumped about 92% since the company resumed regular dividends in 2012. While Apple's current yield is a mere 1.3%, investors who bought in around the time of Apple's first dividend now are earning a 5%-plus yield on their shares.Market value: $207.9 billionDividend yield: 2.9%Cisco Systems ( CSCO , $45.48), whose networking gear helped build the Internet, is now trying to reinvent itself as a subscription company as its networking technology itself slowly evolves into software.Along the way, Cisco has become a solid dividend stock. Its 33-cent quarterly payout is almost double the 17 cents it delivered in early 2014. The stock has roughly doubled over the same time frame.One primary focus of CEO Chuck Robbins has been computer security. Cisco now has a suite of such products, available by subscription, like other cloud-based software. The company continually adds to it, too, most recently by adding Duo, which offers "two-factor security" that calls users when they try to sign-in to verify their identity. Other security acquisitions made in the last two years include Observable Networks and Skyport Systems.Cisco reported a huge jump in fiscal fourth-quarter earnings in August, from 48 cents per share to 81 cents, translating into a mere 41% dividend payout ratio.Small wonder that most of the 30 analysts following Cisco currently have it on their buy lists.Market value: $31.5 billionDividend yield: 2.4%The cloud is one of the biggest tech trends of our time. Cloud computing, delivered by "hyperscale" data centers, have been making investors rich since the combination of cheap hardware, open-source software and virtual operating systems were developed last decade.But connecting clouds can be as profitable as running them. Data centers where the fiber lines of clouds often connect are mostly owned by real estate investment trusts (REITs) - a business structure for property owners/operators that requires most profits to be redistributed as dividends.One of the best-run such REITs is Equinix ( EQIX , $392.43). Equinix has more than 190 data centers across 24 countries and is the world's largest colocation data center by market share. But it doesn't just offer infrastructure - it also provides data services, information protection and other solutions that make Equinix more than just a rent collector.Equinix, like Apple, doesn't deliver a particularly high yield, at just 2.4%. But again, like Apple, it's important to consider the company's ability to increase the payout over time. EQIX's payout has grown 35% since 2015, when it reorganized as a REIT, so investors should be encouraged on that front.In its most recent quarter, Equinix grew revenues by 18% year-over-year to 1.26 billion, and its guidance of $1.596-$1.636 billion in adjusted funds from operations (AFFO, an important measure of REIT profitability) would represent roughly 12% improvement from 2017.Market value: $12.5 billionDividend yield: 3.2%Garmin ( GRMN , $66.15) is the house that the Global Positioning System (GPS) built. GPS can tell you where you are, to within a few feet - and Garmin has been utilizing that technology since 1989.Garmin was co-founded by American businessman Gary Burrell, who remains chairman emeritus, and Taiwan-born engineer Min H. Kao, now executive chairman. The company is known for GPS receivers, and moved its incorporation to Switzerland in 2010, although its main office remains outside Kansas City.Garmin only has a float of about 188 million shares, 34% of which are held by corporate insiders. Kao and his family retain the largest single stake in the company, but they have been steadily selling shares in a planned way for tax purposes. This plan minimizes disruption for other shareholders.While you might think a company based around GPS might be dead in the water considering every phone has access to things such as Google Maps, Garmin's still going strong thanks to a renewed focus on wearables (smartwatches and activity trackers), often ruggedized and with satellite phone capability for use in the wilderness.The company raised its earnings guidance in June, expecting to earn $3.30 per share on revenue of $3.3 billion. Garmin made a good stride toward that in its third-quarter results, when it reported profits of $1 per share, up 33% YoY, that were a quarter better than expected. Also encouraging: GRMN snapped years of dividend stagnation this year with a small hike to the June dividend.Market value: $215.0 billionDividend yield: 2.6%Intel ( INTC , $47.11) looked like it was going to be left behind at one point as the PC industry it had a stranglehold on deteriorated, and as it failed to latch on to the mobile trend. But it has reinvented itself this decade as a supplier of chips and software to cloud data centers.Intel is the home of "Moore's Law," described in a 1965 article by co-founder and (later) President Gordon Moore as the idea that integrated circuits double their density, at the same price, every year. It is this concept, which Intel has made a reality, that created the modern technology world. Everything else - PCs, the Internet, devices and clouds - grew out of this central idea.Intel, once a major growth play, has emerged as a solid dividend stock. It has more than doubled over the past decade to its current 30 cents per share.But INTC isn't exactly done growing, either. The company reported a monster earnings beat for its third quarter - $1.40 per share versus $1.15 per share expected - and topped expectations for Q4 guidance. Things were so good that it upgraded its full-year guidance, too. The growth no longer comes from PCs, but from newer streams such as supplying data centers.All this is happening despite the resignation of CEO Brian Krzanich in June and the fact that Intel has yet to hire a permanent replacement.Market value: $815.7 billionDividend yield: 1.7%Microsoft (MSFT, $106.26) was nicknamed "Mr. Softee" because of its dominance of PC software in the 1990s and 2000s. But under CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft could easily be called "Mr. Cloud" today, as its Azure cloud (and applications built on it) has become one of the most stable profit centers around.Microsoft pays out $1.84 in annual dividends - only good for a yield of 1.7%, but the payout has more than tripled since 2010. It costs Microsoft $13 billion annually to service that dividend at its current rate, which isn't a small thing. But MSFT can easily foot the bill; its net income in 2017 was more than $21 billion, nearly double what it was in 2015.Long-term debt of $76 billion could be paid off at a stroke with $133 billion in cash and long-term investments. Even its capital budget of over $10 billion is manageable.Again, this financial heft is made possible because Nadella shoved Microsoft into the modern era by taking the focus off Windows and Word and instead emphasizing cloud services, big data and other pivotal technological trends.Best of all, Microsoft is once again a growth company. It had revenue of nearly $90 billion for fiscal 2017 and $110 billion for the year ending in June, a growth rate of 22%.Market value: $185.0 billionDividend yield: 1.6%Oracle ( ORCL , $48.83) came into its own as the dominant provider of database management software in the 1990s, and has transformed itself since acquiring Sun Microsystems in 2010, most recently by becoming a cloud player.The tech company also became a dividend stock over the past decade, starting at 5 cents per share, quarterly, in 2009, then escalating that payout to 19 cents quarterly as of this year.Oracle's initial resistance to the cloud, followed by a late conversion, has left it with a lot of catching up to do. Founder and chairman Larry Ellison now says the company's future now hinges on its success in cloud applications and its autonomous cloud database.Oracle's acquisition strategy has also shifted from database applications to cloud services, such as Vocado, which works in financial aid, and Iridize, which helps bring people on to cloud applications. Over the last two years it also brought ZenEdge, a security provider, and Wercker, a middleware company, into its suite of services.Analysts were disappointed by Oracle's cloud revenue in the most recent quarter, but earnings of 59 cents per share were still three times greater than the dividend. Co-CEO Mark Hurd insists it can dramatically grow that revenue with applications. Oracle's dividend growth should by the stock a little patience.Market value: $93.0 billionDividend yield: 3.9%Qualcomm ( QCOM , $63.33) controls the technology in your mobile phone, and the dividend's yield of nearly 3.8% makes it seem like a bargain. But know the full story before you jump in.Qualcomm has been engaged in a multiyear battle with Apple over the patent royalties it demands from phone makers. Apple wanted a discount, given its size, and Qualcomm wants a 5% cut of all iPhone revenue. Now the two companies are engaged in court battle as Apple seeks new suppliers, including Intel. Until the case ends, Apple will not be paying royalties to Qualcomm, which has hit the latter hard. A QCOM lawyer recently said that Apple was $7 billion behind on patent royalties.So, why Qualcomm? Because QCOM is among the stocks that should shine with the arrival of 5G technology . The fifth-generation mobile network will offer far more capacity than what's currently available, as well as higher speeds, and will "redefine a broad range of industries with connected services," to put it in Qualcomm's words. And Qualcomm is one of the companies building the technology that will power this 5G revolution, giving it a realistic shot at a comeback bid.Moreover, QCOM boasts a solid balance sheet of nearly $36 billion in cash and short-term investments versus a little more than $15 billion in long-term debt. And despite its issues with Apple, Qualcomm still saw fit to boost its quarterly payout 9% earlier this year.Market value: $91.3 billionDividend yield: 3.2%Intel didn't invent the integrated circuit. Texas Instruments ( TXN , $95.06) did, along with a company called Fairchild Semiconductor, from which Intel eventually emerged.TI, as it's called, decided to focus on digital signal processors (DSPs), which turn analog inputs, sound and pictures, into digital bit streams computers can process, in the 1980s. Today it may be best known as a leader in adding intelligence to ordinary objects, the so-called Internet of Things.Personal finance expert Matthew Ure, a vice president at Anthony Capital in San Antonio, says, "It is hard to imagine a world wherein Texas Instruments will not become more and more relevant."Texas Instruments also is an incredibly relevant dividend stock. The company's shares have gained more than 120% over the past five years, but in fact have been outpaced by the dividend, which has grown 157% to its current quarterly payout of 77 cents per share. Financial planner Joseph Inskeep says the company's "historic" dividend growth means TXN "should be on everyone's buy list."The company should have no problem affording that dividend going forward. Analysts predict 13% annual profit growth over the next five years.Market value: $13.9 billionDividend yield: 4.2%Western Digital ( WDC , $47.77) is a maker of hard drives, which are in the process of being replaced by increasingly cost-effective chip memory. How long the replacement process lasts, and how long Western Digital can prosper in that market and pay shareholders for their investments, is the question.Western Digital has tried to get ahead of market changes by packaging drives as "MyCloud" units, turning old PCs into virtual servers. It has also gotten into the chip memory business, buying SanDisk in 2016 and recently committing to invest $4.7 billion over three years to refresh its joint venture with Toshiba, which will keep the chips flowing.But most analysts following the stock still consider it a buy. They point to $2.3 billion in operating cash flow earned in the first six months of fiscal 2018, and over $3.4 billion in fiscal 2017, sustaining about $600 million in dividend payments. The company's third-quarter earnings declined year-over-year and missed expectations, but the resulting handful of analyst downgrades following that put most of the blame on an oversupply in NAND memory that could keep prices low.Western Digital itself remains a good dividend payer whose annual $2 dole is just more than a quarter of this year's expected profits. While that payout isn't rising, it is safe.

India iPhone sales to fall for first time in four years-researcher
 BENGALURU, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Apple's iPhone sales are set to dip by around a quarter in India's holiday season fourth quarter, putting them on course for the first full-year fall in four years, industry research firm Counterpoint said on Saturday. The Cupertino, California company's struggle to break through with India's 1.3 billion consumers swung more sharply into focus this week after Apple blamed a disappointing set of sales forecasts on a handful of big emerging markets. Chief Executive Tim Cook said after publishing third quarter results that sales were flat in India in the fourth quarter, which includes a month-long festive season culminating this week in Diwali - a bumper period for electronics sales. "Sales are set to drop for the first time in four years," Shah said. "If you look at Q3 - it was 900k last year and this (year) is almost 450k. "Iphones have gone costlier and the features and specs aren't that compelling. The install base of android has grown vastly; the new customer base (for Apple) is not coming." Cook on Thursday called the company's problems in India "speed bumps along a very long journey" and most analysts say that the prestige of Apple's brand should allow it to claim back lost ground as Indians' spending power continues to grow. Shah said that, while more than half the phones sold this year were older iPhone models, high selling prices meant Apple's Indian revenue should still be flat or slightly higher than a year ago. 
 
Better Buy: Garmin Ltd. vs. Fitbit Inc.
  Garmin    (NASDAQ: GRMN) and   Fitbit    (NYSE: FIT) both recently posted solid third quarter numbers that   beat analyst expectations. Garmin's revenue rose 8% annually   to $810 million, beating expectations by $28 million, while its   non-GAAP EPS grew 30% to $1.00 and topped estimates by $0.24.Fitbit's revenue rose less than 1% to $394 million, but   still beat expectations by $12 million. It also posted a non-GAAP   profit of $0.04 per share, compared to a loss in the prior year   quarter, which cleared estimates by $0.08.  Image source: Getty Images.Garmin's stock rose slightly after its report, but Fitbit's   stock skyrocketed 26% thanks to Fitbit's surprising return to   profitability. But after those post-earnings bumps, which stock   is the better all-around investment?Garmin and Fitbit are often considered rivals in the wearables   market. IDC ranked Fitbit as the world's third largest wearables   maker during the second quarter with 9.5% of the market,   while Garmin ranked fifth with a 5.3% share.   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) and   Xiaomi    (NASDAQOTH: XIACF) sat at the top of the market with 17% and   15.1% shares, respectively.Yet Garmin generates less than half of its revenues from   wearable devices. During the quarter, 23% of its revenues came   from the Fitness unit, which sells basic Vivo fitness trackers,   and 26% came from its Outdoor unit, which sells higher-end GPS   smartwatches like the Fenix 5 Plus.The rest of Garmin's revenue comes from its Marine, Aviation,   and Auto GPS devices. The Auto GPS unit remains larger than those   other two units, accounting for 20% of its revenues, but it's   been consistently shrinking due to the rising use of smartphone   navigation apps and in-dash GPS systems. However, Garmin has   consistently offset the declines at its Auto business with   impressive growth across its other segments:RevenueYear-over-year growthFitness$190.2 million14%Outdoor$209.4 million13%Marine$98.8 million28%Aviation$146.4 million17%Auto$165.2 million(16%)Q2 revenue growth. Source: Garmin Q2 report.Fitbit generates nearly all of its revenues from its fitness   trackers and smartwatches. Fitbit's main strategy is to pivot   away from the saturated fitness tracker market with higher-end   smartwatches, like the Versa, and higher-end fitness trackers   with smartwatch-like features, ilke the Charge 3. Fitbit claims   that it's now the second largest smartwatch maker in the U.S.   after Apple.  Fitbit Versa. Image source: Fitbit.49% of Fitbit's revenue came from smartwatches during the   third quarter, compared to just 10% in the prior year quarter.   That improved product mix boosted its average selling price per   device 3% year-over-year to $108, and indicates that its brand   still has pricing power against the Apple Watch.However, Fitbit's shipments and revenue growth simply aren't   that impressive compared to the growth of Garmin's Fitness and   Outdoor units:Q4 2017Q1 2018Q2 2018Q3 2018Shipments5.4 million2.2 million2.7 million3.5 millionYOY growth(16.9%)(26.7%)(20.6%)(2.8%)Revenue$571 million$248 million$299 million$394 millionYOY growth(0.5%)(17.1%)(15.3%)0.3%Source: Fitbit quarterly reports.Simply put, Garmin is a company that consistently generates   positive sales and earnings growth as it pivots away from a core   legacy business, while Fitbit is merely clawing its way back from   the brink. Garmin's diverse range of wearable products also seems   better insulated from Apple's smartwatch blitz than Fitbit's   high-end smartwatches.As a result, Garmin has much higher margins than Fitbit.   Garmin's GAAP gross margin rose 120 basis points annually to   59.4% last quarter, while Fitbit's slid 550 basis points to 39%   on the same basis. On a non-GAAP basis, Fitbit's gross margin   fell 510 basis points to 40.1%. Garmin also pays an attractive   forward dividend yield of 3.4%, while Fitbit has never paid a   dividend.Garmin and Fitbit are both expanding their software ecosystems   with acquisitions,    but those   new platforms    probably won't generate enough revenue to reduce their dependence   on hardware sales anytime soon.Looking ahead, analysts expect Garmin's revenue   and earnings to rise 3% and 2%, respectively, next year --   which are a bit low relative to its forward P/E of 20. Analysts   expect Fitbit's revenue to rise 4% next year and for its net   loss to narrow, although those estimates could be revised after   its surprise profit. Fitbit's stock looks cheap with a P/S ratio   under 1, but its turnaround still isn't guaranteed.I personally wouldn't buy either stock today. Garmin looks   like a stable income play, but there are plenty of   high-yielding stocks    trading at lower valuations, and Fitbit's future still looks   murky. If I had to choose one over the other, I'd stick with   Garmin -- but I'd only buy it after its stock cools down a   bit.  10 stocks we like better than Garmin       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

 Don't let   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock's pullback after its recently released   fourth-quarter update    fool you, the company has had a stellar fiscal year. The iPhone X   proved to be a big winner with consumers, the company's services   and "other products" segments continued their rapid growth, and   earnings per share soared.Unsurprisingly,    Apple stock    crushed the overall market over the last 12 months, with shares   rising 24% (including the stock's   post-earnings sell-off last week    ). During this same time frame, the   S&P 500    gained only 6%. As investors look back over Apple's strong   performance recently, here are seven impressive metrics from the   fiscal year.  Apple CEO Tim Cook. Image source: Apple.Apple's revenue jumped 16% year over year in fiscal 2018,   increasing by more than $36 billion to a record $266 billion.So much for Apple's iPhone business stagnating. iPhone revenue   jumped 18% year over year as consumers gobbled up the iPhone 8, 8   Plus, and X, despite their   higher starting prices    than their predecessors. The iPhone X, of course, entered totally   new pricing territory for iPhones, with a starting price of $999.   Apple's pricing power in fiscal 2018, therefore, was as strong as   ever.Highlighting how important Apple's services business has   become to the company, the segment's revenue was $37 billion in   fiscal 2018 -- nearly $12 billion more than the company's   third-largest business segment (Macs). Services revenue in fiscal   2018 was up an impressive 24% over fiscal 2017.One strong catalyst that continued to deliver impressive   growth for Apple's services business in 2018 was paid   subscriptions. Paid subscriptions, including Apple Music and all   third-party subscriptions in the App Store, soared from 210   million at the end of fiscal 2017 to 330 million -- that's a   57% year-over-year increase.Apple called out the success of its paid subscriptions in its   fourth-quarter earnings call, saying:We are very pleased, not only with the growth, but also with     the breadth of our subscription business. In fact, 30,000     third-party subscription apps are available on the App Store     today and the largest of them all represents less than 0.3% of     our total services revenue.Sure, Apple's other products segment is still the company's   smallest, but its rapid growth is making it increasingly   important to the tech giant's growth story. Other products   revenue increased 35% to $17.4 billion in fiscal 2018, accounting   for about 7% of total revenue (up from about 6% of revenue in   fiscal 2017). The segment's growth was driven primarily by   Apple's fast-growing wearables business, which includes Apple   Watch, AirPods, and Beats devices.  AirPods and an iPhone. Image source: Apple.Between its aggressive share repurchase program and its   ongoing dividend payments, Apple wasn't shy about returning cash   to shareholders in fiscal 2018. The company paid nearly $14   billion in dividends to shareholders and spent more than $73   billion repurchasing its shares. This brought total capital   returned to shareholders through dividends and repurchases to   almost $90 billion.Apple's revenue growth and share repurchases helped fuel an   impressive 29% year-over-year increase in the tech giant's   earnings per share in 2018.Looking ahead, Apple doesn't look like it will boast the same   torrid growth rates in fiscal 2019 as it did in fiscal 2018. For   its fiscal first quarter, management   guided for just 1% to 5% year-over-year revenue   growth    . But this doesn't mean investors should conclude Apple's growth   story is fading. The company's strong iPhone pricing power,   powerful growth in services and other products, an aggressive   capital return program should continue delivering meaningful   value for shareholders in fiscal 2019 and beyond.

  Marijuana stocks    have captivated investors over the past year as legalization in   Canada and a number of tie-ups with more established companies   have helped legitimize the long-illegal drug.Cannabis stocks have largely faded since Canadian legalization   on Oct. 17, a sign that the sector may be   in a bubble    , while some investors believe that the product is essentially a   commodity that doesn't offer enough opportunity   for differentiation    .In spite of those concerns, there is one popular metric that   bears may be ignoring that shows just how attractive the   marijuana opportunity is: sales per square foot.  Image source: Getty Images.In the retail industry, there is no more important metric for   measuring the popularity of a product or concept than sales per   square foot, or the annual revenue a retailer generates from its   real estate. Sales per square foot shows how efficiently a   retailer uses its space, which is an especially important sign of   success these days as the traditional store model is being   disrupted by e-commerce.It may surprise some readers that marijuana shops, or   dispensaries, are crushing the retail industry in sales per   square foot.According to Costar, a commercial real estate research firm,   the average retailer generates just $325 in annual revenue per   square foot, down from $375 in the early 2000s.The research firm found last year that   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) was tops in sales per square foot for all   companies with $5,546, thanks to its relatively small store   count and popularity of its high-end gadgets like the iPhone.   Tiffany    (NYSE: TIF) , the luxury jeweler, leads its segment with $2,951   in sales per square foot, due to the high price of jewelry, and   Lululemon Athletica    (NASDAQ: LULU) , the high-end yoga clothier, ranks No. 1 in   apparel retailers with $1,560 sales per square foot.All three of those companies are highly profitable with profit   margins in the double digits, have strong brands, and are well   regarded by the general public.However,   MedMen Enterprises    (NASDAQOTH: MMNFF) , an upscale cannabis retailer based in   California that has been described as the "Apple store of pot,"   posted sales per square foot of $6,257 at its California stores   in its most recent quarter. In other words, its stores are busier   than any other mainstream retailer in the country. MedMen, which   is focused on the U.S. market, now has 67 stores across 12   states, factoring in   its acquisition    of Pharmacann, and $39.8 million in revenue last year on more   than 700,000 sales transactions, meaning its average sales   transaction is around $50.MedMen isn't the only marijuana shop posting blowout sales per   square foot. In Seattle, for instance, a study found that the   average pot shop generates $1,513 in sales per square foot, but   some stores make more than six times that. According to the   Marijuana Business Factbook, average sales per square foot in   2016 were $1,773 at recreational dispensaries and $1,143 at   medical dispensaries, both of which are significantly better than   the average broadline retailer.There a number of conclusions we can draw from the high sales   per square foot at MedMen and its peers. First, it shows how   strong the demand is for cannabis products. Companies like Apple,   Tiffany, and Lululemon are able to generate leading sales per   square foot figures because their products are popular and   expensive, and their brands have cache. MedMen seems to exemplify   this strength in the marijuana industry, though the broader   cannabis sector lends itself well to high sales per square foot   as, like jewelry or smartphones, the products are expensive and   small, meaning there's no need for a large space to store   them.Perhaps more importantly, though, the high   sales-per-square-foot figures in the pot industry make those   stores highly desirable for malls and other commercial landlords   looking to drive traffic. Businesses like Apple stores and Whole   Foods are sought after by commercial real estate developers   because they generate high sales volumes and bring in high-end   customers. A chain like MedMen could do the same for shopping   centers, especially as malls are increasingly left with vacancies   as companies like   Sears go bankrupt    .Marijuana investors should be aware that high sales per square   foot don't necessarily correlate into profits. MedMen posted   a wide loss    in its most recent fiscal year at negative $112.3 million;   general and administrative expenses ballooned to $98.2 million as   the company invests in expansion and prepares to   integrate Pharmacann after the recent acquisition. However,   at a store level, the company has a gross margin of 33%,   indicating that the stores themselves are a profitable business   model.No one knows where MedMen itself is headed, as the company   will eventually have to overcome those wide losses, but the   sales-per-square-foot figures make one thing clear.There is enormous pent-up demand for cannabis products, and   that should continue to drive the industry's expansion and a   further push for legalization both in other states and on a   federal level. With booming sales per square foot, it's easy to   see how the marijuana market in the U.S. could eventually reach   $100 billion or more.  10 stocks we like better than MEDMEN     ENTERPRISES       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

 Do you think Warren Buffett might have scooped up shares of   some stocks as the market dropped in October? It's a pretty good   bet that he did. After all, we're talking about the man who once   advised investors to "be fearful when others are greedy and   greedy when others are fearful."While investors' fears appear to be settling down, there   are still plenty of great stocks to be found. Three Warren   Buffett stocks that look like great picks to buy in November   are   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) ,   Mastercard    (NYSE: MA) , and   Markel    (NYSE: MKL) .  Image source: The Motley Fool.Don't think for a second that Warren Buffett worried about   Apple's guidance indicating that revenue growth   will slow    in the next quarter. The legendary investor stated in a CNBC   interview in August that he doesn't like guidance anyway, because   he's "seen it lead to a lot of bad things."Buffett is more focused on what really matters for Apple --   the enduring power of its brand and its massive ecosystem of   products and services. Investors who aren't worth billions of   dollars would be wise to focus on those things, too.Apple CEO Tim Cook said in the company's latest earnings   release that "we enter the holiday season with our strongest   lineup of products and services ever." Cook's optimism is   arguably on target. Despite Wall Street's gloom over Apple's   forecast for the quarter ending in December, the company is set   to generate at least $90 billion in sales and probably greater   than $21 billion in profit.Over the long run, Apple should continue to deliver solid   returns for investors. Regular upgrades for its iPhone, iPad, and   Mac products will keep bringing customers back for more. New   innovations in wearables, home appliances, and augmented reality   and virtual reality should propel Apple's growth for years to   come.Buffett wasn't making a dumb move in boosting Apple to become   Berkshire Hathaway    's (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) top holding. This stock is still a   smart buy now.Berkshire doesn't own nearly as much Mastercard stock as it   does    Apple stock    . But the giant payment processor looks like an attractive choice   for Buffett to pick up more shares of.Mastercard's advantages were clearly on display in the   company's   third-quarter financial results    . The company posted strong year-over-year revenue and earnings   growth. Mastercard performed especially well in international   markets despite headwinds from currency fluctuations.CEO Ajay Banga summed up the case for Mastercard by saying in   the company's Q3 earnings release, "Our business wins and   new partnerships, strengthened by our differentiated services   offerings, are helping drive our global momentum." Perhaps the   most important part of Banga's statement is his emphasis on   Mastercard's "differentiated services offerings."Mastercard bundles its core payment infrastructure with   security features, data analytics, loyalty-point management, and   other products and services. This differentiation helps the   company attract new customers and retain existing ones.There's a payment-processing revolution of sorts underway   right now, with the world moving to cashless financial   transactions. Mastercard is one of the top leaders in this   revolution.Now for a twist. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway doesn't own any   shares of Markel. Nada. So why does Markel make this list of top   Buffett stocks to buy in November? It could be the poster child   for exactly the kind of stock that Buffett likes.In many respects, Markel is a mini-Berkshire. It's a holding   company that focuses primarily on insurance and reinsurance, but   also owns other businesses and stocks of other companies. That   sounds a lot like Berkshire.Markel co-CEO Tom Gayner even sounds similar to Warren   Buffett. Gayner   told The Motley Fool's Matt Koppenheffer a few   years ago    that he liked to buy companies and stocks of companies "that   remain relevant, and that have good businesses, and that their   customer bases can expand over time, and you can own them for a   long time."Because of Markel's specialty insurance and reinsurance   businesses, the company can feel the brunt of catastrophes such   as hurricanes and typhoons. But even with an underwriting loss in   the latest quarter resulting from Hurricane Florence and Typhoon   Jebi, Markel still   turned in a solid performance    .Like Buffett, Markel owns positions in Apple and Mastercard.   Markel's biggest holding isn't either of these stocks, though.   What is Markel's top stock? Berkshire Hathaway.It could be tempting to avoid buying stocks altogether with   the market's unsettling gyrations. But remember what the Oracle   of Omaha once said: "Opportunities come infrequently. When   it rains gold, put out the bucket, not the thimble." The October   pullback has given investors a great opportunity to buy great   stocks like Apple, Mastercard, and Markel.

Tech Stocks This Week: Fitbit Soars, Apple Falls, and More
 In   another busy week in tech    as earnings season continues, this week's top stories feature two   earnings reports and one major acquisition.Here's what you should know about each of these stories.  Image source: Getty Images.On Sunday, IBM announced that it's acquiring open-source   software vendor Red Hat, in a deal valued at $34 billion. IBM   said it will pay $190 in cash per share for Red Hat.Since Red Hat was trading at just $116 before the buyout was   announced, shares of the cloud software company surged when news   of the deal broke. The stock skyrocketed   more than 40%    on Monday."This acquisition brings together the best-in-class hybrid   cloud providers and will enable companies to securely move all   business applications to the cloud," said IBM and Red Hat's press   release about the acquisition. "Companies today are already using   multiple clouds. However, research shows that 80% of business   workloads have yet to move to the cloud, held back by the   proprietary nature of today's cloud market."With Red Hat under IBM's ownership, the two companies believe   they will be better positioned to help accelerate multi-cloud   adoption.The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2018 and   is subject to regulatory approval, a shareholder vote, and other   customary closing conditions.Fitbit impressed investors this week when it reported   better-than-expected revenue and a surprise profit. The company   posted revenue of $394 million, beating a consensus analyst   for revenue of $381 million. The company's non-   GAAP    earnings per share came in at $0.04, well ahead of a consensus   forecast for a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.01.  Fitbit Charge 3. Image source: Fitbit.Fitbit CEO James Park was optimistic about the company's   recent momentum, noting that the company saw sequential growth   for both its tracker and smartwatch devices. "We are now the No.   2 player in the smartwatch space in the U.S. -- a category we   just entered with zero share only 14 months ago," Park said.Park also raved about the company's   recently released Charge 3    , which he said is now "one of the top selling devices in the   U.S."Fitbit stock soared on the day following its earnings release,   rising more than 20%    on Thursday.Tech giant Apple also beat expectations for both its top and   bottom line, reporting   an impressive 20% and 41% year-over-year   increase    in revenue and earnings per share, respectively. But shares fell   sharply after the report because of the company's   weaker-than-expected outlook for its important holiday   quarter.Apple said it expected revenue for its first quarter of fiscal   2019 to be between $89 and $93 billion, up from revenue of   $88.3 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Analysts,   on average, were expecting Apple to guide for revenue of $93.02   billion. Management cited   a range of factors    negatively affecting its guidance for the quarter, including   currency headwinds, the timing of its iPhone launches this year   compared with last year, uncertainty about its ability to ramp up   supply of new products, and more.

Fitbit    (NYSE: FIT)  rose by a whopping 26% after earnings. The   report was good, but was it 26% good? What's really behind the   bump?

Click here        to learn about these picks! *Stock Advisor returns as of August 6, 2018               The author(s) may have a position in any stocks       mentioned.      This video was recorded on Nov. 1, 2018.  Chris Hill:    It's Thursday, Nov. 1. Welcome to   Market Foolery    ! I'm Chris Hill. Joining me in studio, from Motley Fool Asset   Management, it's not Bill Barker. I'm glad to say it's Charly   Travers in the house. Good to see you, man! Charly Travers:    Good to see you, Chris! Hill:     Thank you for being here. We've got music streaming. We've   got a preview of Apple's earnings later today. But we're going to   start with the stock of the day. To the surprise of probably   everyone, including the company employees and management   themselves, the stock of the day is Fitbit. Third-quarter profit   and revenue came in higher than expected. Fitbit also raised   guidance for the fourth quarter. The stock is up 26% this   morning. Travers:     That's a big move. Hill:    That's a heck of a big move. And this is a stock that's been down   for so long. We've talked on this show over the past few weeks,   we've seen this with other companies in other industries, where   they get a big pop, you do the pull-back and you look at the last   year or two, three. We saw it early this week with   Under Armour    . Huge pop, then you look back, and you're like, "Oh. Yeah."You tell me. How enthusiastic should non-Fitbit shareholders   be? I'm not a Fitbit shareholder. Is this a corner that they've   turned? I have to believe at least part of this pop is, some   investors, maybe on the institutional level, saying, "You know   what? I'm going to give them a shot." Travers:     Yeah, the company is certainly in the right place, as far   as the intersection of consumer technology and healthcare. I   think that's a very real trend that is here. There's a number of   big-name consumer electronic companies trying to spin a health   and fitness angle. There's also medical-device companies trying   to have more consumer-friendly devices as well. Fitbit is   certainly one of the major players here. So I think they're in   the right space. I think there's a long growth trajectory to   these types of products. They seem to be striking the right chord   with consumers on the watches side. That's a relatively recent   move for this company. They started out with trackers, but now   they have watches that have a lot more functionality, and that's   half their business at this point. It really went from nothing a   little over a year ago to being a big portion of what they're   doing.One of the issues there, though, is that watches are coming   with lower profit margins than those trackers did. As that   becomes more important to their business, and as that's driving   sales growth, the profit margins are coming down. Maybe that's   just a temporary phenomenon, and they can work through that over   time.I think one of the bright spots here is overseas sales. That   was up 10% for them. It's really nice to see that they're getting   global traction. But I think this is probably more of a case of   coming off of low expectations driving that big jump in the stock   price, rather than anything that they were reporting,   necessarily, in the financials or on the product line. Hill:    We've certainly seen the case before where Company X comes out   with a really good earnings report, their guidance is a little   weaker than Wall Street analysts were expecting, and the stock   drops, not on the results but on the guidance. Let's go ahead and   assume that what's driving Fitbit's stock today is not just that   the quarter was better than expected, but also the raising of   guidance for the fourth quarter, which is so important for them.   They need to crush this next quarter, don't they? Travers:    As with all consumer electronics companies, you make your year on   the Christmas season. The next eight weeks are really going to be   key for them and set the tone for 2019. Hill:     Let's move on to Spotify, which, in some ways, is more   baffling than Fitbit. Spotify reported a profit for the third   quarter, which was not expected. Their revenue came in higher   than expected. They're closing in on 200 million monthly active   users. Why is this stock down 8%? Travers:    I suspect a lot of that is due to the valuation. There's been a   lot of companies this earnings season putting up phenomenal   numbers, and the stock is down. Not to the extent that Spotify is   today, but it's almost like, if you're not beating and raising   and you have a richly priced stock, you're going to get a little   bit of a haircut.Looking at the numbers, I think if you're a Spotify   shareholder -- which I'm not -- you have to look at what they're   putting up and what's going on in the business and be pretty   happy with it. What I was specifically looking for was the   Premium subscribers, the people who say, "Spotify gives me enough   value that I'm willing to pay a monthly fee for it." They're   guiding for that to be up over 30% this year as far as the   subscriber count. The revenue is growing. I think they put up 31%   in the quarter. And it's not just sales growth, it's profitable   growth. Their margins are getting better. As this company is   getting bigger, getting more people to pay, they're becoming more   profitable. You look at the trailing numbers, and you see a   business where things should be, by all appearances, going   according to plan. Hill:    You mentioned the valuation. This stock went public at $132 a   share. With this drop today, it's basically right back there. It   had popped up. Big IPO, all that sort of thing. It's trading in   the high $130s right now. Is it still a pricey stock? Travers:    They have a roughly $25 billion valuation right now for a   company that I don't believe is making money. I mean, they're   getting closer. Hill:    I was going to say, they reported a profit this quarter. No one   was expecting that. Travers:    Right. So, yeah, by traditional metrics, you would say it's   expensive. But as we've seen with other subscription companies   that have big, engaged member bases, those companies can   really stay richly priced for a long time and appreciate in   value. The old metrics may not apply to a company like this. Hill:    You and I were talking about this earlier today. Your home has a   Spotify subscription? Travers:    Yes. Hill:    I've got a Pandora subscription that I got for the missus last   Christmas. It really does seem like one of those things ... I'm   not going to compare it to   Netflix    , because they are both in roughly the same business, but Netflix   is doing things on a level that Spotify and Pandora are not. But,   I think they are similar from the standpoint of, "Here's this   entertainment subscription in my home. I like it. If they come   out and raise the price a buck or two, I'll probably pay it." Travers:    That is what history says. The value is so compelling. It's the   equivalent of two or three cups of coffee a month, and people   listen to this for many, many hours. Hill:    Or, in my case, two or three cups of coffee a day.You're working on something new at Motley Fool Asset   Management. Travers:    Yeah! It was a pretty exciting week for us on our team. We   launched the Motley Fool Small Cap Growth ETF earlier this   week. Hill:    This is the second ETF from Motley Fool Asset Management. The   first one was the Fool 100. How is this different from the Fool   100? Travers:    The Fool 100 is a passively managed product, just like you would   have for an S&P 500 index tracker. The Fool 100 is tracking   an index of Motley Fool newsletter recommendations and   high-conviction ideas from the analyst team that goes into Fool   IQ. It's a market cap-weighted index. Our Small Cap Growth ETF is   an actively managed product. I'm the lead portfolio manager. What   our team does is just old-fashioned stock research, finding   Motley Fool-type companies, where we love the management team,   love the growth trajectory. We're long-term buy-and-hold   investors, so, much more of a classic stock-picker kind of   product. Hill:     I'm assuming, given the market volatility of the past few   weeks, you're finding more small-cap options than you were maybe   two or three months ago. Travers:    There's always companies I like in all environments well. Hill:    And that's the thing -- we've talked about this before. For   people who are value investors, and are sticking to a very   specific set of metrics -- and there's nothing wrong with that --   what happens sometimes is, you can be caught up in a situation   where a market gets frothy, and if you're sticking to your value   metrics, you're looking around like, "I've got nothing. I have no   moves here because there are no 'value' stocks." Whereas, if   you're working with a different set of parameters, you find more   opportunities. Travers:    My counterpoint to that situation would be, all companies are   reporting horrible numbers. You're in a recession, sales are   down, profits are getting crushed. And you're like, "There's   nothing that looks good." Hill:     Well, great. Congrats on the launch! Travers:    Thank you! Hill:    One thing before we get to Apple. Thanks to Joe Walsh, longtime   listener, who sent this fantastic story. Since we are just hours   removed from Halloween -- some of the listeners may have seen   this story -- Reese's, known for their peanut-butter cups,   upped their game this Halloween with a machine that they placed   in Tarrytown, N.Y., that they called the Reese's Halloween Candy   Converter Machine. Producer Dan Boyd pointed this out -- it's a   little bit of trolling the other candy companies. But it's a   smart move by Reese's. They basically said, "Kids love to trade   candy." In some ways, if it's not the best part of Halloween,   it's the second-best part. You get together with your friends   after your trick or treating, you're like, "I like these. You   like those. Let's see, let's do some trading here." Reese's said,   "You know what people love? Our candy. You know what they don't   love? Other companies' candies." So they set up this machine,   Dan, where you can take your candy and trade it in for Reese's   Peanut Butter Cups. Dan Boyd:    It's a fantastic idea. It's basically being like, "Hey, everyone,   we're the best candy, all y'all know it, so come and get our   candy and give us your terrible candy that sucks." Hill:     [laughs] Remember at the beginning of the football   season, we were talking about how Budweiser placed those locked   refrigerators all around the city of Cleveland, I think it was   with Bud Light in them. The whole thing was, "If the Cleveland   Browns actually win a football game, we'll unlock the fridges,   and it's free beer for everybody who's at these bars." And we   talked about, "Hey, that's a smart branding move by them." It   doesn't really cost them a ton of money, when you think about how   much money a company of that size is spending. It's just a smart   move. I feel like, to your point, Dan, this is one level above   that. At least in the case of Budweiser and the Bud Light fridges   in Cleveland, they weren't going around and trolling other beer   companies. They were just being like, "Hey! We're giving away   free Bud Light!" Reese's is kind of going to another level. Boyd:    There's one difference between the Bud Light promotion and the   Reese's thing. Reese's -- Hill:    Which is owned by   Hershey    . Boyd:    -- has cornered the peanut butter and chocolate market, 100%. If   you want something that has both peanut butter and chocolate,   you're buying a Reese's Cup or you're making it yourself with   whatever ingredients you have on hand. And it's not like peanut   butter and chocolate are hard to come by. And, I mean, come on.   It's peanut butter and chocolate. Who doesn't want it? And where   else are you going to get that on the planet? Hill:     Smart move by Hershey. Travers:    Totally agree. Hill:    I like what they're doing. Apple is reporting earnings after the   bell today. I mentioned earlier in the week, on   Motley Fool Money    this weekend, it's an all-earnings-palooza show. We will be   talking about that on   Motley Fool Money    this weekend. You tell me, Charly. What's one thing investors   should be keeping an eye on when it comes to Apple's report? Travers:    Rather than focusing on phone units or those ungodly prices   they're apparently getting people to happily pay. I just can't   believe what a phone costs these days. I'm kind of interested in   the services side of what Apple is doing. I think that is   stealthily a very good business that is maybe underappreciated in   the way that   Amazon    Web Services is for Amazon. So if you look at Apple, with the App   Store, the music, and a burgeoning health monitoring business   under there -- they are working with a company called   BioTelemetry    on cardiac monitoring. That's the part of Apple that I think is   maybe underappreciated and could be a growth engine for them   going forward. So I want to see what they say about that.

  Facebook    (NASDAQ: FB) management has usually avoided calling out   competitors by name on its earnings calls. It's rare that the   company focuses on any specific competitor instead of just its   own products.However, on Facebook's third-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark   Zuckerberg called out two competitors in particular that Facebook   sees as challengers to its success over the next few years. With   regard to growing Messenger and WhatsApp, Zuckerberg sees   Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iMessage as the biggest product standing in its   way, particularly in the United States. In its efforts with video   on Facebook Watch and IGTV, Zuckerberg called out Google's   YouTube, part of the   Alphabet    (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) conglomerate.  Image source: Facebook.Zuck pointed out that Facebook's messaging apps, WhatsApp and   Messenger, are the leading messaging platforms in most countries.   But in countries like the U.S., where the iPhone accounts for   nearly half of the smartphone market, iMessage has a significant   lead. That's because Apple makes iMessage the default messaging   app on iPhone, integrating standard SMS into the same app.That's a subtle hint that Zuckerberg thinks the actions of   Apple may be similar to what   Microsoft    did in the early 2000s by bundling Internet Explorer with   Windows. The case is very different, though, as Apple gives away   iOS for free and doesn't offer iMessage on any non-Apple   platform. Microsoft, on the other hand, charged for Windows and   also developed Internet Explorer for other operating systems.In countries where Android has a much larger share of the   market, Facebook dominates. Zuckerberg says one of the main   reasons for the popularity of its apps, particularly WhatsApp, is   its record on privacy.Apple also holds data privacy in high regard, but Zuckerberg   took at a shot at Apple by referencing the fact that it stores   encryption keys for Chinese iCloud users on Chinese servers. That   makes it possible for the Chinese government to access some   users' iMessages directly instead of being required to go through   the U.S. legal system. However, he didn't mention that Facebook   doesn't officially operate in China (and it would likely be held   to the same standards if it did), or that Facebook has faced   numerous   data privacy challenges    this year.Apple's continued improvements in iMessage and the dominance   of iOS in valuable markets like the U.S. could curb the   monetization capabilities of Messenger and WhatsApp. Importantly,   though, Facebook is taking an approach to monetization that   relies on a relatively unique use case: interacting with   businesses. iMessage is used for interacting with friends, but   Messenger and WhatsApp have a growing number of   business-to-consumer interactions. Apple has tried to make   iMessage a   business communication tool    in the past, but it hasn't caught on. That's where Facebook will   make its money even if it doesn't capture 100% of messaging.Facebook's video strategy has changed meaningfully over the   last couple of years. While it originally grew video views in its   feed products, management started changing course last year. In   an effort to reduce passive consumption and focus on the unique   value proposition of Facebook -- connecting people -- Facebook   changed its feed algorithms    and started directing passive video consumption to Watch and   IGTV.Watch and IGTV currently contain a lot of professionally   produced content. By comparison, YouTube has a mix of   professional, semi-professional, and amateur content. Facebook   wants to make Watch and IGTV a place for all types of videos, but   it's currently spending money to seed the Watch ecosystem and   attract viewers. The efforts are starting to pay off as   Zuckerberg noted that Watch grew users 3 times over the last few   months. Still, it's a long way away from YouTube's   1.8 billion users    .Migrating video views to Watch and IGTV could have a   deleterious impact on revenue growth at first, as Zuckerberg   points out the revenue per minute spent watching video is less   than that of scrolling through a social feed. But if Facebook can   grow the Watch and IGTV communities into self-sustaining content   engines, it could be a highly accretive source of revenue.   YouTube generates an estimated   $15 billion    in revenue, and that might be on the conservative side.Facebook will need to continue investing in ad products for   Watch and IGTV as well as its messaging platforms. Zuckerberg   said video and messaging are two of the company's biggest   challenges and opportunities going forward. While YouTube and   iMessage represent considerable obstacles, there's still a great   opportunity for Facebook to grow and monetize its video and   messaging apps in spite of their competitors' massive user   bases.  10 stocks we like better than Facebook       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Here's How Much More Share Intel Could Gain in the Apple iPhone
 Last quarter, chip giant   Intel    (NASDAQ: INTC) reported that sales of its cellular modems   rose 131%    , clearly fueled by its position as the   sole supplier    of the cellular modems into   Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL) latest trio of iPhones. (Intel was one of two   suppliers in the last two iPhone generations.)Although sweeping the entirety of this year's iPhones means   that Intel's share of Apple's cellular modem orders is slated to   rise dramatically over the course of the current iPhone product   cycle, Intel's modem share in the iPhone still isn't 100% --   Apple's older iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 families don't use Intel   modems exclusively.  Image source: Intel.If Intel keeps winning all the modem orders in future iPhones,   then as older generations of iPhones fall off and are replaced by   newer models, the company could find itself with 100% modem share   at Apple in a couple of product generations.Below, I'll estimate just how much cellular modem share there   could be for Intel to gain.Apple doesn't break out the sales of individual iPhone models;   it has historically disclosed unit shipments and revenue and,   beginning with its next earnings release, will only break out   revenue.Fortunately, analyst Gene Munster with Loup Ventures   published his predictions    for what percentage of shipments in total fiscal year 2019   (that's the current fiscal year) each model in the current lineup   will make up.According to Munster, the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus combined   are set to be 13% of Apple's fiscal year 2019 iPhone unit   shipments, and shipments of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus stand   to make up 28% of unit shipments during the year. If Munster's   projections are accurate, then this means that a whopping 41% of   the iPhones that Apple will sell in the current fiscal year won't   come exclusively with Intel modems.Now, here's where things get even trickier and more error   could be introduced. While we know that both Intel and   Qualcomm    (NASDAQ: QCOM) supply modems into the iPhone 7-series and iPhone   8-series devices, we don't know exactly how the two companies   split the orders. To make things simple, let's just assume that   they split the modem orders for these phones evenly. Under that   assumption -- and, admittedly, it's a crude one -- Qualcomm would   still have about 20.5% of Apple's modem orders over the course of   the current product cycle.Whatever the actual figure is, though, it's certainly nonzero   and likely significant, and still represents additional room for   Intel to grow its modem share at Apple over the next two years --   assuming that the iPhone 7-series is discontinued in the   coming product cycle    and then the iPhone 8-series goes away in the subsequent one,   with both devices replaced by exclusively Intel-powered   products.I'll be keeping a close eye on how Intel's cellular modem   business progresses, and will continue to report back as new data   points come in.  10 stocks we like better than Intel       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

5 Staggering Metrics Capture Apple's Huge Fourth Quarter
 A glance at much of the media coverage surrounding   Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL) earnings report earlier this week presents   quite a gloomy picture for the stock. With headlines referring to   worse-than-expected iPhone sales, management's   "cautious" outlook for the holiday quarter, analyst   downgrades, and the stock's move lower after the report, it could   be tempting to conclude the tech giant is facing some troubling   times.Yet Apple's business is faring better than many headlines   about the company's latest earnings report would suggest. For   instance, Apple's earnings per share during the quarter were up   an incredible 41% year over year. To get a more objective   view of how the company is doing, sometimes it's useful to simply   take a look at the raw numbers. To this end, here are five of the   most insightful metrics from Apple's fourth-quarter update.  Apple executives Tim Cook (right) and Jony Ive. Image     source: Apple.Apple's revenue rose 20% year over year, driven by   strength in its iPhone, services, and "other products" segment.   This growth rate was up from 17% year-over-year revenue   growth in its third quarter of fiscal 2018. And this was its   eighth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth.But wait, weren't Apple's iPhone sales worse than   expected?The worse-than-expected iPhone sales the media is referring   to are   unit    sales. The company sold 46.89 million iPhones -- below a   consensus analyst estimate for 47.5 million. But should investors   really be concerned? iPhone revenue during the quarter soared 29%   year over year thanks to a much higher average selling price than   analysts were expecting. iPhone average selling prices for the   quarter came in at $793 -- a whopping $42 above what analysts   were modeling for.The company's services segment had its best quarter ever in   Q4, with segment revenue rising 17% year over year to $10   billion. And even this strong growth rate understates how well   the segment is doing. Adjusting to exclude the impact of a   favorable one-time accounting adjustment in the year-ago quarter,   services revenue was up 27% year over year.Driving this strong growth was record revenue for the App   Store, Apple's cloud services, Apple Care, Apple Music, and Apple   Pay, management said in the company's   fourth-quarter earnings call    .As part of its   aggressive capital return program    , the company spent $19.4 billion repurchasing 92.5 million   shares during the quarter. Including the $3.5 billion it paid in   dividends during the period, the company returned over $23   billion to shareholders.Helped by both Apple's 20% increase in revenue, and the   company's   fatter gross profit margin    during the quarter versus the year-ago period, fourth-quarter net   income increased an impressive 32% year over year to $14.1   billion. When you combine this strong net income growth with the   impact of Apple's share repurchases since the year-ago quarter,   EPS skyrocketed 41% year over year.Sure, the company's guidance for just 1% to 5% year-over-year   revenue growth in its fiscal first quarter of 2019 may be   somewhat of a disappointment given the company's reinvigorated   product lineup headed into the holidays. But Apple's business   isn't just doing fine -- it's firing on all cylinders.

 By Trevor Hunnicutt NEW YORK, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc, the conglomerate run by billionaire Warren Buffett, on Saturday said its quarterly operating profit doubled as its insurance business dodged hurricanes and benefited from lower taxes. The strong result gives Buffett more cash to deploy even as the well-known bargain-hunting "value" investor has admitted struggling to find a place to put those earnings to work and resorted to buying back $928 million in his own company's stock in the latest quarter. Helping the company's insurance operations were lower estimated liabilities from property and casualty insurance in prior years and lower taxes. The year prior included major losses due to three U.S. hurricanes and an earthquake in Mexico. Insurance underwriting income was $441 million in the third quarter, compared to a loss of $1.4 billion in the year-ago period. "This is absolutely one of the biggest quarterly earnings reports that has ever come out of a United States corporation," said Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management, a Berkshire shareholder. Berkshire said third-quarter net income rose more than 355 percent to $18.5 billion, though that reflected a new accounting rule requiring it to report unrealized investment gains with earnings. Buffett said the rule could lead to "wild and capricious" results and can mislead investors, who should look at operating profit instead. Berkshire's effective tax rate for the third quarter was 19.2 percent compared to 25.3 percent in the year-ago period following a reduction of the corporate tax rate that President Donald Trump signed into law in December. Many U.S. companies' reported results have been skewed by the law's impact. 
 OVER $100 BLN TO SPEND Insurance provides a stream of cash that Berkshire can invest around the world. Float, or insurance premiums collected before claims are paid and which help fund Berkshire's growth, ended September at $118 billion. The company has $103.6 billion in cash, short-term Treasuries and other similar investments. Buffett's last big acquisition was in January 2016, when Berkshire paid $32.1 billion for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts. In July, the company announced relaxing a policy that had effectively prevented Buffett from buying back the company's shares at current prices.  Berkshire is based in Omaha, Nebraska, and has more than 90 businesses in the insurance, chemicals, energy, food and retail, industrial parts, railroad and other sectors. Their day-to-day operations are overseen by Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, each seen by investors as a possible successor to Buffett, 88, as chief executive. Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 94, handle major capital allocation decisions. Berkshire's profits improved across each of its major business units. Their results painted a picture of a U.S. economy that continues to grow but faces increased pressure from rising costs, in part due to the Trump administration's imposition of tariffs. In its building products and McLane's grocery and foodservice businesses, for instance, Berkshire reported higher fuel and raw materials costs, hurting profits.  Yet at Burlington Northern Santa Fe LLC, Berkshire's rail business, they were able to increase prices as more businesses ship by rail due to tight supply in the trucking market. Berkshire warned that insurance losses due to Hurricane Michael are currently estimated in the $350 million to $550 million range for the fourth quarter.  
 UNDER-PRICED? Berkshire's Class A shares closed Friday at $308,411.01 per share, delivering a total return of 3.6 percent for the year, a bit ahead of the S&P 500's 3.4 percent return. And the company's book value per Class A share, reflecting assets minus liabilities and a preferred measure of growth for Buffett, was $228,712 on Sept. 30, higher than $217,677 one quarter ago. Among his favorite investments, Buffett has gobbled up shares of Apple Inc. Berkshire's stake in Apple was worth $57.6 billion at the end of the most recent quarter, up from $47.2 billion at the end of June. Shares in Apple fell nearly 7 percent on Friday, cutting its market value back to less than $1 trillion after it forecast softer-than-expected sales for the holiday quarter and fueled nerves over iPhone sales by saying it would no longer release the figures.  Steven Check, president of Check Capital Management Inc, a Berkshire shareholder, said Berkshire's buybacks were a good sign. "It makes sense to me because the stock traded at higher valuations for most of the quarter than where the stock was bought at," said Check. "It reconfirms what we've known for a long time, which is that the stock has been under-priced." 
 
Apple's iPhone Just Had Its Best Year Ever
  Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone product category has fundamentally   reshaped the company over the past 11 years. Thanks in large part   to this product franchise, Apple is the most valuable   publicly-traded company in the world, commanding a   market capitalization    of roughly $1 trillion.The iPhone business achieved record results in Apple's   fiscal year    2015. iPhone unit shipments surged 37% to 231.2 million in that   year and iPhone revenue grew by a staggering 52%, hitting $155   billion -- thanks to both this robust unit growth and a higher   average selling price (helped by the introduction of the   company's larger and pricier iPhone 6 Plus).  Image source: Apple.iPhone unit shipments and sales both dropped sharply in the   company's following fiscal year, to 211.9 million and $136.7   billion respectively, before inching up to 216.8 million and   $141.3 billion respectively in fiscal year 2017.In fiscal year 2018, Apple's iPhone business had its best year   ever -- at least in terms of the most important metric. Let's   take a closer look.In its fiscal year 2018, Apple shipped 217.7 million iPhones,   just a smidgen higher than what it shipped in fiscal year 2017   and almost 3% more than what it shipped in fiscal year 2016.   You'll note, though, that this is still below the unit shipments   record that the company set during its fiscal year 2015.While Apple wasn't able to top its fiscal-year 2015 iPhone   shipments in its fiscal year 2018, it did manage to set an   all-time record for iPhone revenue at $166.7 billion -- up about   7.5% from the fiscal-year 2015 peak. A significant increase in   the company's iPhone average selling price allowed Apple to do   this without shipping a record number of units.As you might recall, Apple began selling the (   now discontinued    ) iPhone X, a device that cost $999 for the 64GB version and   $1149 for the variant with 256GB of storage capacity, on Nov. 3,   2017. This was during the first quarter of Apple's fiscal year   2018. The success of that device -- which, in the words of CEO   Tim Cook, "changed the industry, and along the way became the No.   1 smartphone in the world" -- was instrumental in pushing up   iPhone average selling prices over the course of fiscal year   2018.During Apple's fiscal year 2018, the company generated $265.6   billion in revenue and $59.5 billion in net income -- both   all-time highs for Apple, and both helped substantially by the   success of its iPhone business.Of that $265.6 billion, $166.7 billion -- roughly 62.8% of the   total -- came from iPhone sales. For some perspective, that's an   increase    from the approximately 61.6% of revenue that the iPhone made up   during the company's fiscal year 2017, although it's below the   63.4% it provided in fiscal year 2016 and the eye-popping 66.3%   of sales it accounted for in fiscal year 2015.Apple is still extremely dependent on the performance of its   iPhone business. This is true even as it enjoys growth in both   its services business (up 27% year over year last quarter,   excluding "a one-time favorable adjustment of $640 million   recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017") and its   wearables business    (which Cook said had "revenue growth over 50%" last quarter).Apple began selling the iPhone XS and   iPhone XS Max    on Sept. 21, and the less-expensive iPhone XR on Oct. 26. I look   forward to seeing how those devices perform over the course of   fiscal year 2019, and what the company has in store for its   all-important iPhone product lineup in the years ahead.

Facebook Roundup: Earnings, Elections, UK, Brazil, Iran, More
 Facebook FB  reported very strong earnings despite investor misgivings about its recent scandals and the possible impact on its numbers. Other news includes shareholders pushing the company to remove founder Mark Zuckerberg from the chairmanship and fresh accusations of fraud on its advertising partners. Here are the highlights- Earnings Facebook reported solid earnings growth on revenue that missed by a sliver. Unsurprisingly, the Asia/Pacific market remains its strongest because of relatively low penetration rates and slower engagement in developed markets. Usage in Europe was also impacted by the implementation of GDPR and a certain amount disenchantment with the platform following the many scandals it has been involved in of late.Advertising revenues, around 92% of which were attributable to mobile saw greatest strength in the Asia/Pacific and Europe, although all regions grew strong double digits. Feed ads are the main contributor although stories ads are expected to gain momentum over the next couple of years, as the company taps the additional potential based on user preferences. The initial cost of getting more users and advertisers to use the format may mount however.    Read more:  Facebook (FB) Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates,   Revenues Up Y/Y   U.S. Elections Facebook has created a tool that can help political candidates directly pitch to millions of people. Candidate Info as the tool is called features thousands of direct-to-camera vertical videos where federal, state and local candidates introduce themselves, talk about their qualifications and offer details about their priority policies and goals if they are elected. The videos appear in users' news feeds and will soon also be aggregated under an Election 2018 bookmark in the mobile app.Separately, Facebook and Twitter TWTR  have denied evidence of Chinese meddling in U.S. elections after president Donald Trump accused China of doing just that, which Beijing promptly denied.The company hasn't seen the end of its troubles with respect to sentiment swaying at election time. The New York Times and Vice News have independently found that Facebook's measures to improve election ad standards falls way short of requirements. That's because its ad buyer verification method doesn't extend to the "Paid for by" disclosure.So an anonymous identity can be assumed in that field, including names like Tom Perez, Islamic State and Mike Pence (as Vice found). This defeats the purpose of the measure. Facebook has said that such ads shouldn't have been approved, but as of now there seems to be a gap between the safety measures it says it intends to take and those that are actually operational. UK Fine & Hire The UK slapped a 500,000 ($645,000) fine on Facebook, which the social networking giant can shrug off pretty easily. But this was the maximum amount allowed under the old privacy rules. The EU has since moved on to the GDPR, which the UK has also adopted in substance.The fine was for allowing individual app makers between 2007 and 2014 access to user data without their clear and informed consent, allowing one app developer, Dr Aleksandr Kogan and his company GSR, to harvest the Facebook data of up to 87 million people worldwide that was then sold off to a Cambridge Analytica.Under the current rules (after May 2018), Facebook may have been fined up to 4% of its global revenue, or 17 million pounds.The former British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has been appointed by Facebook to lead its global affairs and communications team, amid a constant stream of scandals related to privacy, fake news and election meddling. He willreport to Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. Brazil Elections Facebook said it banned 100,000 accounts in Brazil where far-right politician Jair Bolsonaro took up against leftist Workers' Party candidate Fernando Haddad in elections held on Oct 28. The company's so-called War Room for detection of fake accounts spreading propaganda and inflammatory material to sway public opinion detected the activity and allowed the company to act quickly.However, WhatsApp couldn't avoid government involvement since messages on the platform are encrypted and so unavailable to Facebook. So the Brazilian top electoral court TSE approved the opening of a probe over actions to distribute bulk electoral messages against leftist presidential candidate Fernando Haddad over the messaging service. Iran-Related Fake Accounts Facebook's cleanup operations are in full swing ahead of the U.S. midterms. Its threat intelligence team, part of its new election-focused War Room, detected unusual activity related to some 82 pages, groups and accounts (33 Facebook accounts, 30 Facebook Pages and three Facebook groups, as well as 16 Instagram accounts) that were posing as British and American citizens to move liberal opinion in the two countries, according to the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab.The accounts had reportedly attracted over a million followers who were systematically exposed to "politically charged" topics such as race relations, opposition to U.S. President Donald Trump and immigration.In the words of Ben Nimmo, an information defence fellow with the Digital Forensic Research Lab, "It looks like the intention was to embed in highly active and engaged communities by posting inflammatory content, and then insert messaging on Saudi and Israel which amplified the Iranian government's narrative…Most of the posts concerned divisive issues in the U.S., and posted a liberal or progressive viewpoint, especially on race relations and police violence." Shareholders Don't Want Zuckerberg as Chairman Several big shareholders including state and city treasurers from Illinois, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania joined the New York City Pension Funds and Trillium Asset Management in a proposal to Facebook's board to separate the CEO and chairman positions, as is common practice even in other technology firms such as Alphabet GOOGL  , Microsoft MSFT  and Apple AAPL  .The proposal is the result of a number of missteps by Facebook in dealing with foreign meddling in U.S. elections, a massive data breach and the Cambridge Analytica scandal.For what it's worth, it will be put to shareholder vote at the company's annual shareholder meeting in May 2019 that can easily be defeated by the shareholder with 60% voting rights, i.e. Zuckerberg.Meanwhile the company decided to settle with shareholders that opposed Zuckerberg's decision to sell most of his shares while maintaining control over the company through the creation of a special class of shares. The board obviously approved the move but Zuckerberg decided against it last year. By paying $67.5 million in legal fees through his insurance company, he has now avoided explaining his actions (initial demand was for $129 million). Fresh Lawsuit for Inflating Video Views Crowd Siren, which accused the company of falsely inflating video viewership numbers in a California court case back in 2016, is now saying that Facebook knew about the problem for a long time before telling its advertising partners.On perusing documents provided in the court case, Crowd Siren discovered that some advertisers raised the issue way back in July 2015 and the company sat on it for a year while trying to figure out how to downplay the impact. It finally let its partners know in 2016 that ad viewership numbers were inflated by 60-80%. Crowd Siren says that the inflation was in fact 150-900%.The organization is now accusing the company of fraud (that Facebook is brushing aside) and asking for an unspecified amount of punitive damages, legal fees and other relief.

 Shares of CVS Health CVS  fell 1.8% during regular trading Friday in a sign that investors might be a bit nervous about the pharmacy powerhouse ahead of its quarterly earnings release Tuesday. With that said, CVS is coming off a better-than-expected second quarter and looks ready to complete its Aetna AET  deal. So let's see if investors should think about buying CVS stock ahead of its Q3 financial results. Quick Q3 Overview Earnings season has so far failed to help lift the market, with underwhelming results and guidance from giants such as Apple AAPL  and Amazon AMZN  . Yet, 75.2% of S&P 500 members have seen their total earnings surge 25.4% from the same period last year on a 9.3% revenue jump. Plus, 78.2% have beat EPS estimates and 64.1% have topped revenue estimates (also read: Earnings Estimates Coming Down  ). CVS As far as CVS is concerned, its stock price fell in October along with many others. But shares of CVS had climbed in the six months before that point. October also marked what could prove to be a pivotal point in the company's history after the U.S. Department of Justice allowed CVS to move forward with its proposed acquisition of Aetna. CVS said it remains on track to close its $70 billion deal in the early part of the fourth quarter.CVS' plan to buy the health insurer comes amid a shifting healthcare and pharmaceutical landscape. This includes Amazon's continued push into the pharmacy business, along with Walgreens Boots' WBA  Rite Aid RAD  deal. Amid all of these changes, CVS saw its same-store prescription volume surge of 9.5% last quarter. Plus, the company's same-store sales popped 5.9% and same-store pharmacy sales rose 8.3%. Q3 Outlook CVS is expected to see its third-quarter revenues pop 2.2% to reach $47.19 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. Last quarter, CVS' net revenues rose 2.4% to $46.71 billion, which just passed our estimate. Meanwhile, same-store sales are projected to climb by 5.3% and same-store pharmacy sales are expected to be up 7.5%, based on our NFM estimates.Looking a bit further down the road, CVS' fiscal 2018 revenues are projected to climb 2.23% to hit $188.88 billion. Meanwhile, CVS fiscal 2019 revenues are expected to jump 4.4% over our 2018 estimate.Moving onto the bottom end of the income statement, CVS is projected to post adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.71 per share. This would mark a 14% jump from the year-ago quarter. The company's adjusted EPS figure surged 27% last quarter to come in above our $1.61 estimate. Investors should note that CVS' fiscal 2018 earnings are projected to jump roughly 19.5%. Earnings Trends CVS' quarterly earnings consensus has lost one penny on the back of a negative estimate revision within the past 60 days. However, CVS' earnings consensus for fiscal 2018 and 2019 have climbed over the last 90 days.The company also has a strong track record of quarterly earnings beats, including a 4.97% beat last quarter and a 6.47% beat in the first quarter. Yet, we can see that coming in above quarterly earnings estimates has not always led to strong stock price movement, even though it did in the previous two periods.    CVS is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that also sports "A" grades for both Value and Growth in our Style Scores system to help it earn an overall "A" VGM score. Therefore, investors might want to consider CVS stock, especially if they are bullish on the potential of its Aetna deal.CVS is scheduled to release its Q3 2018 financial results before the market opens on Tuesday, November 6.

 After rising for   three consecutive sessions    , U.S. stocks pulled back on Friday as investors pored over the   latest round of corporate earnings reports. The   Dow Jones Industrial Average    (DJINDICES: ^DJI)  and the   S&P 500    (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)  both saw modest losses. Data source: Yahoo! Finance.  Image source: Getty Images.Tech set the pace for today's losers after several days of   gains, with the   Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund    (NYSEMKT: XLK)  falling just under 2%. But the retail sector   largely bucked the negative pressure, with the   SPDR S&P Retail ETF    (NYSEMKT: XRT) rising 0.8%.As for individual stocks, quarterly reports from both   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) and   Starbucks    (NASDAQ: SBUX) produced contrasting reactions from investors.Shares of Apple fell 6.6% after the tech juggernaut released   fiscal fourth-quarter 2018 results    -- but that's not to say those results were disappointing.   Quarterly revenue climbed 20% to $62.9 billion, driving a 41%   increase in earnings to $2.91 per share. Analysts, on average,   would have settled for earnings of only $2.78 per share on   revenue of $61.6 billion."We're thrilled to report another record-breaking quarter that   caps a tremendous fiscal 2018," stated CEO Tim Cook, "the year in   which we shipped our 2 billionth iOS device, celebrated the 10th   anniversary of the App Store and achieved the strongest revenue   and earnings in Apple's history."Cook added that Apple only recently introduced new versions of   its iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, and Mac, leaving it poised to   "enter the holiday season with [its] strongest lineup of products   and services ever."So why the decline? First, Apple told investors to expect   fiscal first-quarter 2019 revenue of between $89 billion and $93   billion. Most analysts were modeling sales near the high end of   that range.Second, Apple revealed it will no longer disclose unit sales   data for its iPhone, iPad, and Mac products starting next   quarter. Management explained during the   subsequent conference call     that unit sales are no longer an effective metric to gauge   the underlying strength of the business. But the move to reduce   visibility into its results will almost certainly stoke fears   that Apple is attempting to mask an impending decline for any of   its most popular product lines.Shares of Starbucks   popped 9.7%     after the coffee giant announced impressive fiscal   fourth-quarter 2018 results. Starbucks' quarterly revenue climbed   11% to $6.3 billion, driven by new locations and a 3% increase in   global comparable-store sales. On the bottom line, that   translated into 13% growth in adjusted earnings per share, to   $0.62. By contrast, consensus estimates called for earnings of   $0.60 per share on revenue of $6.27 billion."Starbucks record Q4 performance reflected meaningful   improvement in virtually every critical operating metric compared   to Q3," stated CEO Kevin Johnson. "As we enter fiscal 2019, we   are executing against a clear growth agenda, with a focus on our   long-term growth markets of the U.S. and China."What's more, for fiscal 2019 Starbucks is targeting 2,100 net   new stores worldwide, with global comparable-store sales growth   near the lower end of its current 3% to 5% range. That should   mean revenue in the coming year increases 5% to 7%, which should   translate into adjusted earnings per share of $2.61 to $2.66. In   this case, both ranges were in line with Wall Street's   expectations.In the end, given its relative outperformance this quarter and   with Starbucks stock trading roughly flat year to date leading   into this report, it's hard to blame investors for bidding up   shares to a fresh all-time high.

Close Update: Wall Street Surrenders Early Gains As Trade Hopes Dwindle
Wall Street's benchmark averages closed with a loss on Friday as hopes for a US/China trade deal evaporated and disappointing iPhone sales left Apple ( AAPL  ) shares at their lowest level since August.Despite bullish labor market data and trade jawboning by President Donald Trump, the Dow closed with a triple-digit loss but up 2.3% for the week. The S&P 500 was higher by 2.4% for the week, while the Nasdaq -- Friday's worst performing index -- closed out the week 2.6% higher and in the green for the first time since September.US/China trade dominated market action Friday with comments from NEC head Larry Kudlow and President Trump jerking the Dow within a 400 point range.The risk rally went into overdrive last night after Bloomberg claimed President Trump tasked his cabinet with putting together a trade deal with China. Kudlow said the reports were false but that Trump is planning to negotiate with Chinese president Xi Jinping next month at the G20 meeting. Later, Trump pulled stocks off their lows with assurances that a deal would be good for the US, allowing the Dow to cut its early losses in half.The pivotal jobs report was nearly overshadowed by developments in Washington even as non-farm payrolls surged 250,000 in October and average hourly earnings rose by more than 3% year-over-year for the first time in more than nine years.Additionally, factory orders jumped 0.7% in October, following an upwardly revised 2.6% gain the month prior, and the US trade deficit swelled to $54.0 billion as imports and the trade deficit with China set record highs.US MARKETSDow Jones Industrial Average down 109.91 points (-0.43%)S&P 500 was down 17.31 points (-0.63%)Nasdaq Composite Index was down 77.06 points (-1.04%)GLOBAL SENTIMENTFTSE 100 was down 0.29%Nikkei 225 was up 2.56%Hang Seng Index was up 4.21%Shanghai China Composite Index was up 2.70%UPSIDE MOVERS(+) PACB (+67.63%) To be acquired by Illumina ( ILMN  ) for $8 per share(+) EXEL (+16.45%) Reported better-than-expected Q3 results(-) ARCB (+12.66%) Q3 earnings beat expectationsDOWNSIDE MOVERS:(-) PBYI (-48.01%) Sales of Nerlynx disappointed(-) WTW (-29.73%) Missed Q3 estimates for EPS and revenue(-) ADVM (-26.59%) A1AT measurements did not reach "clinically meaningful levels of expression"(-) CPS (-24.09%) Q3 EPS plummets, sells anti-vibration business(-) MDRX (-18.94%) Q3 results fell short of expectations
The Dow traded in a range of 500 points on both sides of breakeven today, ultimately ending in the red. While stocks started the session strong on a solid  October jobs report   , an ugly earnings reaction from FAANG stock Apple ( AAPL  ) ultimately tipped the scales in the bears' favor. In addition, the White House threw a wet blanket on a Bloomberg report that an official trade deal with China is in the works, but President Donald Trump tried to walk it back, telling reporters that the two countries are getting closer to striking an accord.While it wasn't enough to keep the major market indexes from snapping their three-day win streaks, the Dow wrapped up its best week since June, and the Nasdaq enjoyed its best week since May. The S&P fared even better, notching its best week since March.

    Apple AAPL  reported fourth quarter earnings on Thursday after the bell. Earnings and revenues did beat analyst expectations, but soft Q1 guidance and a miss on iPhone sales left many investors worried.Another announcement that shook investors was that Apple would no longer be reporting iPhone-or any other product-sales numbers on future earnings calls. CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri explained that they believe unit sales had grown less important than total dollar revenue. And, they said that Apple's other lines of business were increasingly important, like its Services division.But this explanation did not calm investors' fears. Citi analyst Jim Suva said: "some investors will view this as a negative that the company is trying to hide information that in the past was so important to assess the company's strength." AAPL stock was trading down 6.5% in mid-morning trading Friday. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies  
Apple's CFO Talks Wearables, Guidance, and More
  Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) just dropped its fiscal fourth-quarter update --   and it was packed with interesting takeaways. Just to list a few   nuggets from the report, revenue increased 20% year over year,   earnings per share soared 41%, iPhone revenue jumped 29%, and   services revenue nearly hit $10 billion.But there were plenty more insights to be had for investors   who went beyond Apple's fourth-quarter earnings release and tuned   into the company's conference call on Thursday evening. Notable   tidbits from the call included a closer look at management's   weaker-than-expected first-quarter guidance    , an update on Apple's thriving wearables business, and more.  Apple Watch Series 4. Image source: Apple.Revenue from Apple's wearables devices (Apple Watch, AirPods,   and Beats products), skyrocketed in Q4, rising 50% year over   year. Strong performance from wearables helped Apple's Other   Products segment's revenue rise 31% year over year to $4.2   billion.With so much momentum in wearables, CFO Luca Maestri said   Apple is renaming its other products segment to explicitly call   out wearables.[S]tarting with the December quarter, we will be     renaming the Other Products category to wearables, home,     and accessories to provide a more accurate description of the     items that are included in this product category.One takeaway from Apple's earnings call that surprised   investors was management's decision to stop reporting unit sales   data for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac beginning with its first   quarter of fiscal year 2019. Some investors may worry that the   company's decision to hide this data from investors reflects a   bearish outlook from management on the key metric. But Maestri   argued the metric simply isn't as relevant to the company's   business performance as it was in the past.As demonstrated by our financial performance in recent     years, the number of units sold in any 90-day period is not     necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our     business. Furthermore a unit of sale is less relevant for us     today than it was in the past given the breadth of our     portfolio and the wider sales price dispersion within any given     product line.Apple's outlook for fiscal first-quarter revenue to come in   between $89 billion and $93 billion fell below a consensus   analyst estimate for first-quarter revenue of $93.02   billion. In addition, this guidance notably implied a much   slower growth rate than what the tech giant has been serving   investors recently. Apple capped off 2018 with its eighth quarter   in a row of accelerating revenue growth, growing fiscal   fourth-quarter revenue by 20% year over year. But Apple's   guidance for its fiscal first-quarter revenue implies just 1% to   5% year-over-year growth.Why the expected slowdown? Maestri listed the factors driving   this guidance in the company's   earnings call    :Investors shouldn't fret management's expectations for slower   growth too much. Not only has Apple's guidance for the holiday   period often proven to be conservative, but management's forecast   for slower first-quarter growth doesn't take away from   the incredible growth Apple has delivered   recently    . In 2018, Apple's top line increased by a whopping $36.4 billion   compared to 2017. Clearly, Apple's business is seeing some   considerable momentum.

  Apple AAPL  reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings of $2.91 per share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12 cents and surged 41% year over year.    Apple Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise      Apple Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise    |      Apple Inc. Quote  Higher ASP and strong iPhone revenues reflect increasing loyalty of the company's consumers. Apple quoted a latest survey report from 451 Research, which stated that customer satisfaction was 96% for iPhone 8, 8 Plus and iPhone X.   Services Momentum Continues    Services - including revenues from Internet Services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and licensing and other services - increased 17% year over year to $9.98 billion and accounted for 15.9% of sales.    Apple stated that paid subscriptions have surpassed $330 million, an increase of more than 50% year over year. The number of apps offering subscriptions also continues to grow and there are almost 30,000 available in the App Store, currently.    Apple Pay's transaction volume tripled year over year. Apple Pay generated more mobile transactions than PayPal PYPL  . The service is now accepted by the likes of Costco and Neiman Marcus. Management stated that 71 of the top 100 merchants and 60% of all the U.S. retail locations currently support Apple Pay.    Apple recently launched student ID passes at several major U.S. universities, which is expected to further improve Apple Pay's adoption rate.    Further, Apple Pay cash is currently the top-ranked mobile peer-to-peer service, according to Consumer Reports.   iPad, Mac & Other Segment Details    Apple sold almost 9.70 million iPads in the quarter, down 6% year over year.

According to 451 Research, iPad customer satisfaction ratings were 96% for both iPad and iPad Pro.    Apple Mac unit sales declined 2% year over year to almost 5.30 million. Mac revenues of $7.41 billion increased 5% from the year-ago quarter and accounted for 11.8% of sales. The year-over-year growth was driven by robust sales of MacBook Pro (launched in July) and positive impact of the back-to-school season.    In September, Apple introduced macOS Mojave, which comprises new features like Dark Mode, Stacks and a completely redesigned Mac App Store.    Apple witnessed solid growth in Latin America, India, the Middle East and Africa, and Central and Eastern Europe. The company stated that active installed base of macs reached a new all-time high in the quarter.   Wearables' Robust Performance    Other products, including revenues from Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, iPod, and Apple-branded and third-party accessories, jumped 31% year over year to $4.3 billion and accounted for 6.7% of sales.         Total revenues from wearables, which include Apple Watch, Beats and AirPods, increased more than 50% year over year. Apple expanded distribution of HomePod to Spain and Mexico.    The company also opened new stores in Italy, Japan and China during the quarter. Apple is set to open a new store in Thailand, which will bring the number of stores to 506, almost half of which are outside the United States.   Geographical Performance    The Americas (43.7% of sales) generated revenues of $27.52 billion in the quarter, up 19% year over year.    Europe (24.5% of sales) generated $15.38 billion in revenues, up 18% on a year-over-year basis.    Greater China (18.1% of sales) increased 16% from the year-ago quarter to $11.41 billion. Business in China was backed by not just iPhone X but also Mac, Watch and Services.    Revenues from Japan (8.2% of sales) soared 34% year over year to $5.16 billion.

Country wise, Apple reported 25% or higher growth in Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Japan and Korea.

Operating expenses increased 17% year over year to $7.97 billion due to higher research & development (R&D), and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, up 25.1% and 10.5%, respectively. The operating expenses figure was within the management's estimate of $7.95-$8.05 billion.    Operating margin expanded 60 bps on a year-over-year basis at 25.6%.

Apple returned about $23 billion in the reported quarter through dividends and share repurchases.   Guidance    For first-quarter fiscal 2019, revenues are projected between $89 billion and $93 billion. Apple expects $2 billion of foreign exchange headwinds to negatively impact top-line growth.    The company also stated that it is facing headwinds in emerging markets like Turkey, India, Brazil and Russia, primarily due to weakening domestic currency that has forced the company raise prices of its products.    Management stated that beginning first-quarter fiscal 2019, Apple will no longer provide unit sales data for iPhone, iPad and mac.    Gross margin is expected to be 38-38.5%, while operating expenses are projected to be $8.7-$8.8 billion.

Top Tech StocksMSFT -0.13%AAPL -7.02%IBM -1.34%CSCO -0.82%GOOG -0.64%Technology stocks were falling in recent trading, with the shares of tech stocks in the S&P 500 dropping almost 2.3% in value while the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index was posting a nearly 1.9% decrease.Among technology stocks moving on news:(+) Arista Networks ( ANET  ) was 6% higher retracing half of a nearly 12% advance earlier in Friday's session that followed the cloud networking company reporting improved Q3 financial results and beating Wall Street expectations, prompting RBC Capital Markets to increase its price target for the company's stock by $10 to $300 a share.In other sector news:VeriSign ( VRSN  ) soared to its best share price since the height of the internet boom in September 2000, rising over 25% to $176.59 a share after the domain name registry company reported Q3 net income of $1.23 per share, up from $1.00 per share during the year-ago period and beating the Capital IQ consensus by $0.04 per share. The company also disclosed it reached a deal with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers to raise prices for ".com" names.(-) Apple ( AAPL  ) slumped badly Friday, recently falling more than 7%, after CFO Luca Maestri said during a conference call late Thursday that the technology giant will no longer provide iPhone unit sales data starting with results for the current quarter ending Dec. 31. The announcement upstaged better-than-expected fiscal Q4 financial results, earning $2.91 per share on $62.9 billion in sales compared with the Street view expecting $2.78 per share on $61.6 billion in sales. iPhone sales were little changed from year-ago levels at 46.9 million compared with 46.7 million.
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBlue-chip stock are supposed to be a stable, solid, market-leading companies - safe investments. But in today's market, what does that even mean?Blue-chip stocks are often reliable sources of income, but a dividend isn't all that makes a blue-chip stock. They need stable, safe growth as well. Companies that aren't growing are dying. Fat dividends may just mean a slow dissolution.I personally also like to see a strong CEO at the helm. The CEOs of the companies listed below are all proven, of high quality, and they've built corporate cultures that assure smooth transitions on their retirement.Here are 3 blue-chip stocks to buy:No U.S. bank is bigger, or better run, than JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM ). I summarized it in a headline almost five years ago. Shine on you Jamie Dimon. The 80 cent quarterly dividend currently yields 3.05%, against 3.16% for the U.S. 10-year bond. That works out to a 34.9% payout ratio, which indicated the dividend is stable and safe.In addition to safety you have financial strength, assets of $2.61 trillion, revenue of over $93 billion, more than one-quarter of which goes directly to net income.The 2008 financial crisis, and the government response to it, forced U.S. banks to strengthen their balance sheets, which are now the best in the world, and JP Morgan Chase is the best of the best. When European or Latin American banks falter, JP Morgan Chase is going to be the name they turn to.What more do you want in a blue-chip investment?It's strange that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is so seldom listed among blue-chip investments, because under CEO Tim Cook it has become the best one in the world.Sure, the 73 cent quarterly dividend yields just 1.37%, but the stock's value has nearly tripled in the last five years. This is the most valuable company in the world, with an estimated $244 billion of cash on hand , even as it buys back shares, raises the dividend, and insists it will contribute $350 billion to the economy due to tax cuts.I am also very impressed with Cook's own product innovations, like the Apple Watch . Best of all, Cook succeeds without turning his customers' data into advertising fodder.The P/E ratio is 17.  but take out the cash and it's about 15, which is dirt cheap. If that's not a blue chip I don't know what is.Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) shares have almost tripled in value over the last five years, and the quarterly dividend has increased from 28 cents per share to 42 cents under CEO Satya Nadella. That makes the yield 1.77%, but as a Microsoft shareholder I'm not complaining.Nadella has Microsoft growing again, revenue rising over 15% last year, and on track for a gain of nearly 10% this year. It's bringing nearly one-third of that revenue to the net income line, and the balance sheet in September showed it with almost $133 billion in cash and short-term investments. As I wrote in 2015, this is not your father's Microsoft .Microsoft's Azure cloud has been leading the revitalization. Along with Amazon  (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and IBM (NYSE: IBM ) is one of the top three cloud infrastructure and service providers in a world increasingly dependent on the cloud. By putting its own operations on Azure, Microsoft has nearly eliminated the seasonality that used to plague results.Dana Blankenhorn  is a financial and technology journalist.

 Stocks were down in morning trading Friday, putting major indexes on track to snap a three-day winning streak that followed a brutal month of selling. Friday's renewed volatility comes amid heightened fears of a hawkish Fed and disappointing guidance from Apple AAPL  , which many bulls were betting on to deliver great results.Recent losses are also a result of shifting sentiment around the prospects of a trade deal between the U.S. and China. While there were some indications in recent weeks that an agreement could be reached soon, the latest word is that a resolution to the ongoing trade war is not imminent.We have started to compile plenty of evidence that this trade war is having an impact on U.S. businesses, as a number of firms have highlighted rising input costs and tariff burdens in their most recent earnings reports.Other than that, Q3 report season has been relatively strong, with top and bottom line growth remaining robust across most sectors. That said, there are still plenty of reports left to come in, and investors must stay prepared for the latest developments.To do that, one can use the Zacks Earnings Calendar  to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.Today, we have gone one step further and selected a few of next week's top reports to preview right now. Let's take a closer look at a few of the earnings announcements due during the week of November 5. 1. CVS Health Corporation ( CVS ) After a tough start to the year, CVS shares had rallied over the past six months before pulling back during the market's red October. The pharmacy retailer is close to closing its merger with Aetna, and Wall Street is growing excited about the new joint company. CVS will hope to inspire even more excitement when it reports before the bell on November 6.Analysts are expecting CVS to report earnings of $1.71 per share and revenue of $47.19 billion, according to our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates. These results would represent year-over-year growth of 14% and 2%, respectively. CVS' earnings consensus has lost one penny on the back of a negative estimate revision within the past 60 days.  2. Qualcomm Incorporated ( QCOM ) QCOM shares rallied about 50% from their 52-week lows in late April to touch a new one-year high in September, but market-wide volatility and fears of an impending semiconductor selloff have battered the stock recently. The chip behemoth will look to buck that trend with strong results after the closing bell on November 7.Consensus estimates have the company's earnings pegged at $0.83 per share, down nearly 10% from the prior year. This projection has added a penny in the last 60 days, however. Meanwhile, revenue is expected to come in at $5.53 billion, down more than 6% on a year-over-year basis.  3. The Walt Disney Company ( DIS ) Media giant Disney will report its latest quarterly results after U.S. markets closes on November 8. The stock fared quite a bit better in October than many other major companies, but as the company continues to transition into the streaming age, its earnings reports present uncertainty.Earnings per share and revenue are projected to be $1.31 and $13.81 billion, respectively. If these figures hold up, they would mark growth of 22% and 8% from the prior-year quarter. Investors will also be hoping for an update on the launch of Disney's over-the-top streaming platform, which is expected to debut next year.  Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.  See Them Free>>  
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis weekend, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B , NYSE: BRK.A ) will announce its latest quarterly report and the profits are expected to be huge. According to Barclays (NYSE: BCS ) Jay Gelb, the earnings are forecasted to hit $18.8 billion, compared to $4.1 billion in the same period a year. This would actually be the highest profit for any company in history. So might this perk up BRK.B stock, which has been kind of lackluster this year?Well, not necessarily. Consider that the earnings will have much to do with non-cash accounting changes. Besides, Berkshire Hathaway is fairly stable, so there is usually not much volatility when it comes to earnings.OK then, so what are some of the other areas to focus on for the quarter? Let's take look:When it comes to BRK.B stock, the critical piece is the insurance business (the firm is the No. 2 player in the property and casualty industry, in terms of premiums), and there is mostly good news on this front. True, the quarter saw the massive Hurricane Florence. But in terms of the exposure to insurance, it was manageable.According to the analysis from AIR Worldwide , the costs are projected to range from $1.7 billion to $4.6 billion. Keep in mind that a large portion of the population in the impacted areas did not have flood coverage. There was also not as much damage from wind.If anything, the most important tailwind for the insurance business is the rise in interest rates. Note that Berkshire racks up substantial premiums, which are a source of stable income. It also helps that the company has been increasing premiums.In this year's shareholder letter, Warren Buffet noted : "Payments are a huge deal worldwide."So given this, it should be no surprise that he is making some notable investments in the fintech category.  For the past few months, they have come to about $600 million - going into Paytm, a mobile payments service based in India, and StoneCo (NASDAQ: STNE ), which is a Brazilian payments processor.Granted, for Buffett, these are relatively small deals (his cash position is about $111 billion). But the investments are definitely a change in strategy as he generally focuses on much larger companies. Yet if he wants to grow Berkshire Hathaway, which is not easy because of its scale, there needs to be more aggressive bets on emerging categories.Still, it has been a mixed bag for Berkshire Hathaway stock and its portfolio … this has been the case with many investors this year.Look at  Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), which is the biggest holding. Unfortunately, the company had an uninspiring quarter, with the shares off 6% early trading. Although, it's important to keep in mind that AAPL stock is still up about 30% for the year.But other holdings have not been as strong. Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ) is off 10% for the year and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) is down nearly 5%. Even with rising interest rates, the banking sector has been in a funk.And yes, Berkshire Hathaway has considerable exposure to consumer staples stocks as well. While they have historically been quite stable, the sector has recently come under pressure because of changes in consumer tastes and inflation. One of Berkshire Hathaway's biggest holdings,  Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC ), is down about 25% for the year.But despite all this, Berkshire Hathaway portfolio's may be undervalued. This is the position of JPMorgan's (NYSE: JPM ) Sarah DeWitt. When accounting for undistributed earnings, the multiple on BRK.B stock is really at 13.6 . To put this into perspective, the historical multiple is at about 17X and this is why she has a $250 price target on the stock, which assumes about 22% upside from current levels.Tom Taulli is the author of  High-Profit IPO Strategies ,  All About Commodities  and  All About Short Selling . Follow him on Twitter at  @ttaulli . As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post What to Expect From Berkshire Hathaway Earnings appeared first on InvestorPlace .
 If you're interested in broad exposure to the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market, look no further than the WisdomTree U.S. Earnings 500 Fund (EPS), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 02/23/2007.The fund is sponsored by Wisdomtree. It has amassed assets over $212.97 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market. Why Large Cap Value Large cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.Carrying lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, value stocks also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. While value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets when you consider long-term performance, growth stocks are more likely to outpace value stocks in strong bull markets. Costs Since cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.28%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.75%. Sector Exposure and Top Holdings It is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 20.80% of the portfolio. Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 6.11% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Jpmorgan Chase & Co (JPM).The top 10 holdings account for about 23.79% of total assets under management. Performance and Risk EPS seeks to match the performance of the WisdomTree U.S. Earnings 500 Index before fees and expenses. The WisdomTree U.S. Earnings 500 Index is a fundamentally weighted index that measures the performance of earnings-generating companies within the large-capitalization segment of the U.S. Stock Market.The ETF has added roughly 1.37% so far this year and it's up approximately 6.11% in the last one year (as of 11/02/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $29.63 and $33.13.The ETF has a beta of 1.02 and standard deviation of 12.25% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 498 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk. Alternatives WisdomTree U.S. Earnings 500 Fund carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, EPS is a reasonable option for those seeking exposure to the Large Cap ETFs area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $36.76 B in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $42.21 B. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.20% and VTV charges 0.05%.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEditor's note: InvestorPlace's Earnings to Watch is updated weekly. Please check back next week for our latest earnings calendar picks.Investors were hoping the earnings calendar would save the market … and it didn't happen. Earnings reports this season have been impressive and yet U.S. stocks have fallen.The S&P 500 , since Oct. 3, has declined over 6%. Yet, earnings season has been notably strong. According to the Financial Times , as of Wednesday, the average S&P 500 component had posted earnings growth of 26.3% year-over-year. More than 75% of the companies in the index beat consensus estimates.But as of last Friday, even those beats on average had led to a 1.5% decline in trading during the following session. Broad investor concerns about the future - tariff impacts, global growth, and valuation - have more than offset strong numbers in the past. And recent post-earnings declines at major companies like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) have only added to those concerns.With the earnings calendar much thinner this week, those forward-looking fears could take center stage. But there still are a few key earnings reports out there in important sectors. The volatile chip sector will hope for good news from one of its giants. A pharmacy giant will discuss a major acquisition and try and keep a rally going.And a global gaming leader will try and reverse a long, steep slide. These three earnings reports aren't likely to move the market at this point - that clearly seems too much to ask.Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, Nov. 6, before market openThe third quarter report on Tuesday morning will be the most important from CVS Health (NYSE: CVS ) in years, for two key reasons. First, CVS finally received approval for its takeover of insurer Aetna (NYSE: AET ). The plans for the combined company - and the likely timing of the deal's closing - will be a key focus of the post-earnings conference call.Secondly, CVS stock is trying to rally - from both a short-term and long-term standpoint. CVS stock touched a four-year low earlier this year, but managed to bounce rather nicely. The rally hit a speed bump earlier this month, however, before resuming over the past few sessions.To keep that rally going, CVS needs a good quarter. Rival Walgreens (NASDAQ: WBA ) posted a solid fiscal Q4 earlier this month - and sits just off a 52-week high as a result. Solid numbers and a strong outlook could result in more upside for CVS stock, and support my bullish call on the stock back in September.A disappointing earnings report, however, would be big trouble. Investors aren't yet convinced on the Aetna merger to begin with. Laying the debt from that acquisition on top of a questionable legacy business changes the story surrounding CVS stock. And it almost certainly means an end to the rally of the last few months.Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, Nov. 7, after market closeGaming stocks like Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ: WYNN ) have been absolutely hammered of late. Before a recent rally - including a 12% bounce on Thursday - WYNN stock had lost more than half of its value just since June 1. The combination of cyclical fears and exposure to the key hub of Macau has led earnings multiples to compress - despite results that haven't been all that bad.Earnings from fellow Macau plays Melco Resorts & Entertainment (NASDAQ: MLCO ) and Las Vegas Sands (NYSE: LVS ) haven't been quite enough to change sentiment. But Wynn's high-end exposure in both Macau and Las Vegas could move the needle. Contribution from the newly opened resort outside Boston offers another catalyst.Wynn desperately needs a good report here and so does the sector. Good earnings may not be enough to turn WYNN back toward $200 - but they can help. Bad earnings mean the selloff of the last few months may resume again.Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, Nov. 7, after market closeSemiconductor stocks haven't performed as badly as gaming stocks - but it's been a rough few months in that space as well. Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) saw a big rally after fighting off a takeover attempt from Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO ), albeit with some help . But after moving from $50 to $75, QCOM stock has given back about half of its gains.Personally, I'm still not sold on QCOM , as I wrote back in September. But the company has an opportunity on Wednesday. Chip stocks have rebounded sharply in the last few sessions, suggesting that the recent selloff may have gone too far. Qualcomm's battle with Apple is starting to look like a stalemate - or at least stable enough for investors to focus on other, more attractive, parts of the business. The rollout of 5G wireless could be a catalyst, and gets closer with every passing quarter.So Qualcomm, too, has a big report on Wednesday. And it's one that could have an impact on the entire semiconductor sector as well. A solid quarter supports the idea that recent cyclical fears have gone too far. Any weakness from Qualcomm, though, could lead investors to sell not just QCOM, but other semiconductor stocks as well.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.The post 3 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week appeared first on InvestorPlace .
 After the closing bell yesterday, technology giant Apple Inc. AAPL  reported its fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results wherein it topped both earnings and revenue estimates but provided weak guidance for the holiday quarter. The company also announced major changes to its reporting structure.  Notably, Apple's services have been growing for years and could become the company's main revenue generator as iPhone sales plateau. The gadget-maker foresees revenues in the range of $89-$93 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The midpoint is below the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $91.32 billion.    On its earnings call, Apple said that the company will no longer break out individual sales numbers for iPhone, iPad and Mac starting next quarter. The three main product lines will be wrapped into one reported revenue figure.   Market Impact    Following the results, shares of Apple dropped below its historic $1 trillion market cap, falling as much as over 7%. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry ( top 44%  ), suggesting significant upside over the coming days.

"The tone was set by Apple's earnings. That's clearly been aheadwind all day," said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer,North Star Investment Management Corp, Chicago. Kuby also cited weak earnings from Kraft Heinz as having aneffect on the broader market. "With Kraft, you have twodifferent types of companies that were disappointing," he said. Remarks by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on CNBCabout trade talks with China also dampened the mood. WhilePresident Donald Trump will meet with Chinese President XiJinping this month, he has not asked U.S. officials to draw up aproposed trade plan, Kudlow said, contradicting a report earlierin the day that had buoyed hopes of a trade dispute resolution. urn:newsml:reuters.com:*:nL2N1XD0YF Stocks extended losses following Kudlow's comments, and thetrade-sensitive S&P 500 industrial index .SPLRCI , which was upearlier in the session, closed down 0.3 percent.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLeading the Apple  (NASDAQ: AAPL ) rumor mill today is news of a change to iPhone sales data. Today, we'll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Friday. iPhone Sales : Apple is no longer going to list the number of iPhone units that it sells , reports BGR . This announcement was made by the company during its most recent earnings report. The company says that it will still report other details about iPhone sales, but not units sold. AAPL argues that these numbers aren't as important as they used to be, which is the reason it is no longer listing them.Election Night : Apple is looking to help keep users up-to-date on the 2018 elections with a new tab in its News app , MacRumors notes. This new tab will take over the place of the 2018 Midterm Elections tab. This change will take place at 8:00 p.m. on Eastern Time on Nov. 6. The new Election Night tab will provide users of the News app with real-time information about the election. Data in the tab will come from the Associated Press.Battery Life : The battery life of Apple's smartphones is declining with each new version , reports 9to5Mac . Tests from various groups saw that the battery life of the iPhone diminishes with the launch of a new version. For example, the iPhone X has worse battery life than the iPhone 8. The same is also true when going from the iPhone X to the iPhone XS. The one exception to this rule is the iPhone XR. The battery life decrease likely has to do with more demanding display tech in newer devices.The post Friday Apple Rumors: AAPL Stops Revealing iPhone Unit Sales appeared first on InvestorPlace .

The move not only underscores IBM's ambitious cloud computing goals, but also makes several comparable tech companies look like interesting takeover targets heading into 2019.There was also plenty of positive earnings news to go around, including some much-needed optimism from Facebook FB  . The social media king actually saw mixed results in its most recent quarter, but Wall Street was more interested in its commentary about the company's future, and that was received well.Starbucks SBUX  also managed to impress this week, reporting strong growth in its mobile ordering and loyalty programs, as well as robust comparable-store sales performances.But it was not all great news on the earnings front, as General Electric GE  missed EPS estimates by a mile and cut its dividend down to just one penny per share. Moreover, Apple AAPL  guided on the light side for its upcoming holiday quarter, sending the stock sharply lower on Friday morning.Investors betting on a bullish reaction to Apple's earnings report have been left disappointed, and the bellwether tech stock stands to be a key reason for breaking Wall Street's green streak.Ryan and Maddy cover all of this news, sharing the key facts and their own perspectives, only on this week's episode of the Friday Finish Line!If you feel that we missed something, or if you want us to cover a different story, shoot us an email at podcast@zacks.com.

Stocks Close Lower On The Day But Higher For The Week - U.S. Commentary
  (RTTNews.com) - After moving notably higher over the past few sessions, stocks gave back some ground during the trading day on Friday. The major averages initially moved to the upside but pulled back into negative territory as the session progressed. The major averages ended the day in the red but well off their lows of the session. The Dow fell 109.91 points or 0.4 percent to 25,270.83, the Nasdaq slumped 77.06 points or 1 percent to 7,356.99 and the S&P 500 slid 17.31 points or 0.6 percent to 2,723.06. Despite the pullback on the day, the major averages moved significantly higher for the week. The Nasdaq surged up by 2.6 percent, while the Dow and the S&P 500 both jumped by 2.4 percent. The downturn on Wall Street was led by Apple ( AAPL ), with the tech giant tumbling by 6.6 percent to a nearly three-month closing low. The steep drop by Apple came after the company reported fiscal fourth quarter earnings and revenues that exceeded estimates but weaker than expected iPhone shipments. Apple also forecast fiscal first quarter revenues of $89 to $93 billion, with the midpoint below the consensus estimate of $93 billion. The pullback by the major averages also came as traders digested a closely watched Labor Department report showing stronger than expected job growth in the month of October. The Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment surged up by 250,000 jobs in October after rising by a downwardly revised 118,000 jobs in September. Economists had expected an increase of about 190,000 jobs. The report also said the unemployment rate in October was unchanged from the previous month at 3.7 percent, its lowest level since hitting 3.5 percent in December of 1969. Average hourly employee earnings rose by $0.05 to $27.30 in October, reflecting a 3.1 percent increase compared to the same month a year ago. The annual rate of hourly earnings growth accelerated from 2.8 percent in September, reaching the fastest pace since April of 2009. The upbeat jobs data paints of positive picture for the U.S. economy but also led to renewed concerns about the outlook for interest rates. "The U.S. jobs market remains incredibly strong and with wages starting to accelerate, domestic price pressures will increase," said ING Chief International Economist James Knightley. He added, "This will keep the Federal Reserve on its path of 'gradual' interest rate hikes with next week's FOMC meeting set to signal a December move." Traders also kept an eye on conflicting reports about the likelihood of a trade deal between the U.S. and China ahead of meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month. Sector News Natural gas stocks moved sharply lower over the course of the trading session, dragging the NYSE Arca Natural Gas Index down by 2.1 percent. Within the natural gas sector, Newfield Exploration (NFX) pulled back sharply after jumping on Thursday after agreeing to be acquired by Encana (ECA) in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $5.5 billion. Significant weakness was also visible among semiconductor stocks, as reflected by the 1.5 percent slump by the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. The index gave back ground after moving notably higher over the past few sessions. Oil stocks also moved notably lower amid a continued decrease by the price of crude oil. Crude for December delivery slid $0.55 to $63.14, the lowest closing level for a front-month contract since April. Pharmaceutical and commercial real estate stocks also moved to the downside on the day, while telecom and steel stocks saw considerable strength. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved sharply higher during trading on Friday. Japan'sNikkei 225 Index shot up by 2.6 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index spiked by 4.2 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets turned in a mixed performance on the day. While the U.K.'sFTSE 100 Index fell by 0.3 percent, the French CAC 40 Index and the German DAX Index rose by 0.3 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively. In the bond market, treasuries moved notably lower following the upbeat employment data. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, advanced by 7 basis points to 3.214 percent. Looking Ahead Results of Tuesday's midterm elections may impact next week's trading, with Democratic leaders optimistic they can retake control the House. Traders are also likely to keep an eye on the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy decision due to be announced next Thursday. The Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged, although the accompanying statement may provide clues about the anticipated rate hike next month. The election results and Fed meeting may overshadow reports on service sector activity, producer price inflation and consumer sentiment. CVS Health (CVS), Eli Lilly (LLY), Ralph Lauren (RL), Wendy's (WEN), Groupon (GRPN), Humana (HUM), Office Depot (ODP), News Corp. (NWSA), Qualcomm (QCOM), Disney (DIS), and Yelp (YELP) are among a slew of companies due to report their quarterly results next week. For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com

 By Roberta Rampton and Susan Heavey WASHINGTON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that he will likely make a deal with China on trade, adding that a lot of progress had been made to resolve the two countries' differences but  warning that he still may impose more tariffs on Chinese goods. "China very much wants to make a deal," Trump told reporters in Washington just hours after his top economic adviser expressed caution about talk of a possible U.S.-China trade agreement. "I spoke with President Xi (Jinping) yesterday. They very much want to make a deal," Trump said. "I think we'll make a deal with China, and I think it will be a very fair deal for everybody, but it will be a good deal for the United States." Trump said he will discuss trade with Xi when the two meet for dinner on the sidelines of the G20 leaders' summit at the end of November in Buenos Aires, Argentina. His administration has demanded that Beijing make sweeping changes to its policies on intellectual property protections, technology transfers, industrial subsidies and domestic market access, along with steps to reduce a $375 billion U.S. goods trade deficit with China. Trump said a deal with China would also be good for Beijing. "If we can open up China and make it fair, for the first time ever -- this should have done years ago by other presidents but it wasn't -- I am very much willing to do it. But China very much wants to make a deal," he said. Trump's comments came a day after a phone call with Xi that he described as "very good.". The president's remarks helped U.S. stocks to trim their losses on a day that started with market optimism over a Bloomberg report quoting unnamed sources as saying that Trump had ordered his cabinet to draw up terms for a China trade deal. But by midday, shares had turned negative, weighed down by Apple Inc.'s  disappointing earnings forecast and comments from White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow that he was less optimistic than previously about a deal between Washington and Beijing. Kudlow, speaking on CNBC, contradicted the Bloomberg report and added: "There's no mass movement, there's no huge thing. We're not on the cusp of a deal."  One of China's vice commerce ministers Wang Bingnan said on Saturday the country is willing to resolve trade issues with the United States through mutually respectful talks and on an equal footing, similar to past comments from Beijing. Trump administration officials have said U.S.-China trade talks cannot resume until Beijing outlines specific actions it would take to meet U.S. demands for sweeping changes to policies on technology transfers, industrial subsidies and market access. Trump said that if a deal is not made with China, he could impose tariffs on another $267 billion in Chinese imports into the United States, adding that China's economy had "been hit very hard" by previous U.S. tariffs. The United States has imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods so far, while China has retaliated with $110 billion worth of tariffs on U.S. goods.

Wall Street Surrenders Early Gains as Hopes For Trade Deal Extinguished
Stocks surrendered premarket gains and were trading with heavy losses after hopes for a US/China trade deal were dashed, wiping out a more than 300-point gain in Dow futures. Weighed by outsized losses in components Apple ( AAPL  ) and Kraft Heinz ( KHC  ), the Nasdaq Composite is underperforming its peers and is in the red for the first time in four days.Despite Friday's poor price action, all the major indices -- including the Russell 2000 -- are still indicated to close the week higher. This would be the first higher weekly close for the small-cap index in seven weeks and the first for the Nasdaq in five weeks.
 During its Oct. 30 product launch event,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) announced much-needed updates to two of its Mac   product lines. The Mac mini, Apple's small, stand-alone desktop   computer, hadn't seen a real upgrade since October 2014, and the   company's MacBook Air -- its entry-level notebook computer line   -- had been left virtually unchanged since March 2015, save for a   modest bump in the specifications of the lowest-cost model.Let's look at what Apple brought to the table with these   upgrades and what they could ultimately mean for the company's   Mac business.  Image source: Apple.Apple's latest MacBook Air enjoys a slew of upgrades. The   casing design is new and quite a bit sleeker than the   prior-generation model. It has a new display that's much sharper   than the older one and, according to the company, supports "48   percent more color than the previous generation."The display also uses IPS technology instead of the TN   technology used in the last-generation MacBook Air display,   translating into better viewing angles.Beyond that, Apple has upgraded the processor, moving from an   Intel     fifth-generation Core processor rated at a 15-watt thermal   design power (TDP) to an   eighth-generation Core processor rated at a   7-watt TDP    . Both performance and power efficiency should be improved as a   result.The company touted the solid state drives in the new MacBook   Air, noting that they are "up to 60 percent faster than the   previous generation" and come in sizes of up to 1.5 terabytes   (TB), up from a maximum of 512 GB on the older models.Apple also added its Touch ID fingerprint recognition   technology, which the company had previously included on its   higher-end MacBook Pro notebook line, a new keyboard, and a new   Force Touch trackpad. The system also now supports Thunderbolt 3   connectivity, which is an upgrade from the Thunderbolt 2 that the   older MacBook Airs supported.The company also pointed out that the MacBook Air's speakers   are "25 percent louder with two times more bass than on the   previous generation for more dynamic range and fuller sound."The overriding point is that the older MacBook Air had gotten   quite stale, and these new systems seem to do a solid job of   modernizing the lineup.Apple also gave its Mac mini desktop computer a huge overhaul.   The previous models used Intel's fourth-generation Core   processors -- chips that are practically antiques at this point   -- and, to make it worse, they used low-power, laptop-oriented   chips.The new models are entirely different beasts. They utilize   desktop-grade Intel eighth-generation Core processors "with quad-   and   6-core processors    ," which allows the systems to offer "up to five times faster   performance than the previous generation."They can be configured with up to 64 GB of system RAM (up from   a maximum of 16 GB in the prior models) and can contain as much   as 2 TB of flash storage. The system, Apple says, is "packed with   advanced ports including four Thunderbolt 3, two USB-A, HDMI   video audio and Ethernet up to 10 [gigabits per second]."The new Mac mini seems like a really nice product that should   reinvigorate consumer interest in the line.I see two potential impacts to Apple's Mac business from these   products. The first is that Apple could see an improvement in   unit shipments, as the new systems are far more compelling than   their increasingly stale predecessors. Indeed, the systems could   help Apple gain share in the personal computer market.In addition to potential unit shipment acceleration, these   systems could also help Apple drive Mac   average selling prices    up -- something the company has successfully achieved with its   iPhone product line    and looks set to do with its   iPad line    .For some perspective, Apple's new MacBook Air starts at $1,199   and is available in configurations that are priced all the way to   $2,599 for 16 GB of RAM and 1.5 TB of storage. Apple's previous   MacBook Air, according to AppleInsider, topped out at $1,549.Apple's new Mac mini starts at $799 and, maxed out, sells for   $4,199. The old Mac mini started at $499, and although Apple's   website for that product line is gone (so I can't tell you how   much a maxed-out version of the older Mac mini costs), I'd   imagine that the price ceiling for that product was considerably   lower than $4,199.Investors should definitely keep an eye on how Apple's Mac   business performs in the coming quarters.

Gone are the days when "wearable" was used to describe comfortable clothes. It’s now a blanket term used for devices or technology connected to internet, embedded in clothes, glasses, caps, watches, or ear plugs. In other words, technology that is considered to be (obviously) "‘wearable."Wearables are gaining wide acceptance thanks to the utility, convenience, and engagement they offer. This trend is in sync with the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and cloud computing.Here’s a look at the wearables space.The number of shipments is increasingThe shipment of wearable devices reached 115.4 million units in 2017, up 10.3% vis-à-vis 2016. IDC forecasts that the worldwide wearables market will ship 122.6 million units in 2018 and further reach 190.4 million units by 2022. A report by CCS Insight predicts the global wearables sales will reach 243 million units by 2022, growing at an average of 20% over the next five years to become a $29 billion market. While another report projects the wearables market size to be $32.42 billion by 2023, growing at a CAGR of 38.8% from 2017 to 2023. Smartwatches, wristbands are the most well-adopted wearables Smartwatches continue remain the most popular wearable, representing around one-third of the shipment volume and two-thirds of the markets in terms of spend due to high price tags as per IDC. This segment is expected to capture around 38% of the wearables market by 2022 with around 84.1 million shipments.Apple, Inc. (AAPL) is a strong player in this segment. With the launch of its Watch Series 4 in September, Apple has introduced newer features such as LTE connectivity, fall monitor, heart rate senor, and ECG, among other features. A recent survey by Counterpoint Research reports the Apple as the most preferred smartwatch brand with more than two out of five people choosing Apple over any other brand. Samsung and Fitbit came second and third on the consumer preference list.The rise in popularity of smartwatches does not undermine fitness trackers and wristbands which enjoy its own market share; together smartwatches, basic watches, and wristbands dominate more than 90% of the wearables market.The launches of Versa, Charge 3, Ace, and Aria by Fitbit (FIT) is helping it regain its lost market share. Fitbit has recently reported its quarterly earnings, which reflected the gain in momentum.“We saw sequential growth in both tracker and smartwatch devices,” said James Park, co-founder and CEO. “We are now the number two player in the smartwatch space in the U.S.—a category we just entered with zero share only fourteen months ago.” Fitbit sold 3.5 million wearable devices driven by the growing mix of smartwatches.Xiaomi, Huawei and Garmin are some other popular brands which together with Apple and Fitbit hold more than 50% of the global wearables market share. While wrist-worn devices dominate wearables market, eyewear, hearables and clothing are seeing increased usage and adoption, although they are under 10% of the overall market.While these products are popular with consumers, wearable devices are capable of far more scalable use in diverse industries along with other advanced technologies Wearables have great utility that lends themselves well to certain industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, mining, transportation and logistics.A range of wearable such as caps, cameras, head-mounted displays have the potential to enhance security in logistics and transportation and even in high-risk industries such as mining. Such devices can track the activity of the driver or mine worker to connect and track patterns and thus alert and reduce number of fatigue-related accidents, among other benefits.Global manufacturers are adopting ‘mixed reality’ to enhance productivity, quality, and safety in operations. BAE Systems and PTC, Honeywell, Mercedes Benz are experimenting with mixed reality using Microsoft’s (MSFT) HoloLens.With the objective to improve accuracy and reduce the complexity of aircraft assembly, Accenture and Airbus used Vuzix (VUZI) industrial-grade smart glasses for cabin seat marking process in 2016 and the results were remarkable: the overall productivity of the marking process improved 500%, error rate reduced to zero, while accelerating the marking operation significantly. The technology has been industrialized for Airbus 330 long range aircraft seat marking and installation since then; other projects are underway.While smartwatches and wristbands get all the attention, the scope for wearables in core operations across industries to enhance efficiency and security is immense.
 Shares of   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) took a hit on Friday, falling as much as 6.2%. As   of 9:51 a.m. EDT, the stock was down 5%.The pullback in the tech giant's stock follows Apple's fiscal   fourth-quarter earnings, released after market close on Thursday.   Specific aspects of the quarterly update that may be worrying   investors include Apple's weaker-than-expected revenue guidance   for its important holiday quarter and the company's decision to   stop sharing unit sales metrics in fiscal 2019.  Image source: Apple.For its fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Apple   reported earnings per share of $2.91 on revenue of $62.9   billion. Driven by   a huge jump in iPhone revenue    , both key metrics beat consensus analyst estimates. On average,   analysts were expecting revenue of $61.6 billion and earnings per   share of $2.78.     But Apple's outlook for first-quarter revenue in fiscal 2019   to be between $89 billion and $93 billion was weaker than the   consensus analyst forecast for revenue of $93.02 billion.In addition, some investors seem to be disappointed that   the company will no longer be reporting unit sales for its   segments. "[A] unit of sale is less relevant for us today than it   was in the past given the breadth of our portfolio and the wider   sales price dispersion within any given product line," said Apple   CFO Luca Maestri during the company's   fourth-quarter earnings call    . Some investors may worry this decision is an indication that   management expects headwinds for unit growth.Apple's revenue guidance implies just 1% to 5% year-over-year   revenue growth for its first quarter of fiscal 2019. This would   be a significant slowdown from the 20% revenue growth Apple   posted in Q4. Of course, Apple Maestri was quick to try to help   investors view the glass as half full during the company's   conference call, noting:At the revenue level, we started [guidance] from the fact     that we are very, very excited about the lineup of products and     services that we have, getting into the holiday season. It's     the strongest lineup that we've ever had, and our guidance     range, by the way, represents a new all-time quarterly revenue     record.

Wall Street is getting more concerned economic weakness in emerging-market countries will hurt Apple  (AAPL).On Thursday, Apple posted fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share  of $2.91 on revenue of $62.9 billion, topping consensus estimates for EPS of $2.78 on revenue of $61.46 billion, according to FactSet.But the midpoint of the company's guidance for the holiday December quarter fell short of Street expectations. Apple forecasted fiscal-first-quarter sales of $89 billion to $93 billion versus the average analyst projection of $93.02 billion.Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Wamsi Mohan lowered his rating to Neutral from Buy for Apple's stock, citing the risk of economic growth slowdowns in India, Brazil, Russia and Turkey."We are incrementally concerned that not all the weakness is capture in [the near term] and we are likely to see further negative estimate revisions," Mohan wrote on Friday.Apple's stock was down 5.5% to about $210 in early trading Friday.The analyst reduced his price target for the smartphone maker's shares to $220 from $235.In similar fashion, Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall blamed Apple's weaker-than-expected guidance on international market volatility."Apple reported strong FQ4 revenue, but missed on FQ1 guidance due to weakness in [emerging markets] and adverse currency movements," Hall wrote Thursday.He reiterated his Neutral rating for Apple and lowered his price target to $222 from $240.In a surprising announcement, Apple also said on its conference call it will no longer offer unit sales data for its products, starting next quarter.The move came after the company slightly missed Street expectations for its smartphone business. It sold 46.9 million iPhones in the fiscal fourth-quarter versus the 47.5 million FactSet StreetAccount estimate.Nomura Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal said the lower transparency may be a signal that weaker iPhone sales are ahead."Reduced disclosure … raises the specter of a sustained iPhone downturn," he wrote on Friday. "Abrupt loss of disclosure suggests weakness beyond one quarter."Kvaal reaffirmed his Neutral rating for Apple's stock and lowered his price target to $185 from $215.

In early trading on Friday, shares of Chevron ( CVX  ) topped the list of the day's best performing Dow Jones Industrial Average components, trading up 4.2%. Year to date, Chevron has lost about 7.5% of its value.          VIDEO: Dow Movers: AAPL, CVX  
 By David Randall NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Concerns that a trade deal between the United States and China may not be imminent reined in a rally in world equity markets and reversed gains on Wall Street on Friday, while strong U.S. wage growth boosted U.S. bond yields. Markets had earlier climbed on hopes that the world's two biggest economies were mending their shaky trade relations. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told CNBC that while President Donald Trump plans to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month, he has not asked U.S. officials to draw up a proposed trade plan, contradicting a report earlier in the day that had buoyed hopes of a trade dispute resolution. That erased early gains in U.S. stocks and curtailed a rally in global markets that had lifted emerging market stocks by their largest daily gain since 2016. "The stock market is focused on tariffs and they believe that increased tariffs are going to hurt the economy," said Mike Rask, director of trading at Hodges Capital in Dallas. "There was the belief overnight that we were close to a trade deal with China and now it looks like that is not the case." The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 109.91 points, or 0.43 percent, to 25,270.83, the S&P 500  lost 17.31 points, or 0.63 percent, to 2,723.06 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 77.06 points, or 1.04 percent, to 7,356.99. Apple's shares tumbled 6.6 percent, taking its market value below $1 trillion, after the company said sales for the final quarter would likely miss expectations.  In Europe, Germany's export-heavy DAX  had jumped as much as 1.5 percent, its best session since July, before giving up most of its gains. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  rose 0.28 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe  shed 0.06 percent. U.S. job growth rebounded sharply in October and wages recorded their largest annual gain in 9-1/2 years, pointing to further labor market tightening that could encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again in December.  Benchmark 10-year notes  last fell 20/32 in price to yield 3.2198 percent, from 3.144 percent late on Thursday. The dollar index, tracking the greenback against six major currencies, rose 0.19 percent, with the euro  down 0.11 percent to $1.1394. Oil prices were weighed down by a report that the U.S. government has agreed to let eight countries, including close allies South Korea and Japan, as well as India, keep buying Iranian oil after Washington re-imposes sanctions.  U.S. crude fell 1.13 percent to $62.97 per barrel and Brent  was last at $72.68, down 0.29 percent on the day.

U.S. Steel Earnings Have Created the Perfect Upswing Opportunity
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) earnings report hogs the headlines this morning, U.S. Steel (NYSE: X ) also reported earnings last night. The knee-jerk reaction from investors sold X stock down 3% on the headline, but now it has reversed to green.Management delivered a solid quarter and the company beat expectations on earnings but they committed the cardinal sin of earnings reports and lowered forward guidance slightly. These days investors want to see confident management teams or else they sell the stock, even on good results. The company is still doing buybacks, so they are confident enough in their future.It hasn't been easy for U.S. Steel stock. They have been operating inside a whirlwind of headlines that's directly impacting their business. Sentiment is extremely bad due to the global tariff war uncertainties, so delivering a solid quarter in this environment is a testament that U.S. steel management is competent and the company will continue to prosper.Fundamentally, X stock is cheap. It sells at a price-to-earnings ratio of 11. Nevertheless, investors don't care. This has been a very difficult year for the whole sector and the X stock price was down 28% going into the U.S. Steel earnings report.The good news is that this morning we have a favorable headline from President Trump alleviating some of the tariff worries. So U.S. Steel stock flipped from being down 3% to "greenish". Regardless of the reason why, often enough a reversal on a headline carries momentum.Fears remain, however, and the U.S. is coming into an election week that is important to the Republican party's growth plans. The country is extremely bifurcated these days and the reaction could be violent. But I do believe that the fundamentals for the economy and the macroeconomic situations still favor upside in stocks.Companies are making money and people are spending it. And this is likely to continue unless the world leaders commit a slew of errors, which is unlikely. There will be ups and downs, but for the long term, the X stock price should do well.Technically, a stock that falls into a prior pivot zone finds support. Those who fought over it back in time would want to fight over it once again. This creates congestion and an opportunity for the bulls to base and mount a rally.This is the case for stock in U.S. Steel. It has support around $24 per share. And in this macroeconomic environment I am willing to risk owning it for the mid term to try and catch the swing back up to $33 per share. While this is not a guarantee, I do believe that the downside risk from current levels is much smaller than the upside potential.As noted, we are not out of the woods so to speak. We are still in a correction from the highs. And we still have big headlines next week and more importantly the threat of higher tariff levels in January if the leaders don't come to terms before then. Moreover, investors also worry that the U.S. Federal Reserve will go too far too fast with rate hikes.The fear is that the Fed Chair Jerome Powell is fighting a battle of wills with President Trump and that our economy will be the one to suffer. So far, the Fed seems intent on raising rates without watching the actual data, so it is prudent to stay mindful of trade size. Accordingly, using tranches versus one lump sum is often best practice.Click  here  for more of my market thesis and get an ongoing free copy of my weekly newsletters.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of  SellSpreads.com .

Apple Earnings: Reporting Changes and Decent Guidance
 Just days after   unveiling new Macs and iPad Pros    ,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL)  reported fiscal fourth-quarter   earnings to close out its fiscal 2018. While the September   quarter tends to be less eventful than other quarters, Apple had   some pretty surprising announcements that are especially relevant   for investors. The company plans to revamp its financial   reporting starting next quarter as it kicks off its fiscal   2019.There's a lot to cover, so let's dig in.  Image source: Apple.Revenue jumped 20% to $62.9 billion, topping Apple's guidance.   iPhone unit volumes were essentially flat at 46.9 million,   but iPhone revenue increased 29% to $37.2 billion as Apple   continues to exercise its pricing power. That   narrative has been playing out    ever since the company introduced the $1,000 iPhone X last year.   iPhone average selling prices (ASPs) rose to $793, up from $618 a   year ago. Apple also sold 9.7 million iPads and 5.3 million Macs,   hitting a new all-time record in quarterly Mac revenue in the   process.The all-important services business also hit a new record,   bringing in $10 billion in revenue during the quarter. When you   exclude the one-time $640 million positive adjustment   a year ago    , that's good for 27% growth. The Mac maker added another 30   million paid subscriptions during the quarter and now has 330   million paid subscriptions. On a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis,   services revenue is now $37.2 billion; Apple is easily on track   to hit its $50 billion target by 2020.  Data source: Apple. Chart by author.Net income came in at $14.1 billion, or $2.91 per share.Ever since tax reform was passed in late 2017, Apple has been   buying back stock hand over fist. That held true again this   quarter, with $19.4 billion in open market share   repurchases.  Data source: Apple. Chart by author.Apple has now repurchased $62.9 billion worth of stock year to   date, bringing its cumulative total repurchases to $239 billion.   After completing its $210 billion program earlier this year,   Apple's board authorized a   cool $100 billion program    in May. The company also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.73   per share to shareholders of record as of Nov. 12, 2018.Apple made major announcements regarding changes to financial   reporting that it will adopt in the December quarter. In what   will prove to be a highly controversial move, Apple will stop   reporting unit sales altogether. Over the past couple of years,   Apple has been aggressively trying to shift investor focus away   from its hardware business (where unit sales are a core metric)   toward its software and services business. This has now   culminated in eliminating unit sales disclosures altogether.Here's how CFO Luca Maestri justified the decision:Our objective is to make great products and services that     enrich people's lives, and to provide an unparalleled customer     experience so that our users are highly satisfied, loyal, and     engaged. As we accomplish these objectives, strong financial     results follow. As demonstrated by our financial performance in     recent years, the number of units sold in any 90-day period is     not necessarily representative of the underlying strength of     our business. Furthermore, a unit of sale is less relevant for     us today than it was in the past, given the breadth of our     portfolio and the wider sales price dispersion within any given     product line.If you wanted to be particularly skeptical, you could consider   the change a tacit admission that unit volumes have indeed   peaked, and that Apple doesn't want investors to overanalyze   minor gyrations on a quarterly basis. It's worth noting that most   of Apple's peers do not disclose unit sales data, either. Apple   has often bragged that it is an exception in that regard, which   will no longer be the case.  Image source: Apple.Apple will also broadly categorize revenue between products   and services, including more granular disclosures around the cost   of revenue for each business. That will give investors a much   better sense of Apple's margin profile, particularly for the   highly profitable services business. You win some, you lose   some.The Other Products segment will also be renamed "Wearables,   Home, and Accessories."Investors weren't especially impressed with Apple's guidance   for the December quarter, sending shares down in after-hours   trading last night. The company expects revenue in the December   quarter to be $89 billion to $93 billion, or 3% growth at the   midpoint. Gross margin should be 38% to 38.5%, with operating   expenses of $8.7 billion to $8.8 billion.The Street had been modeling for $92.9 billion in sales,   meaning Apple will have to hit the high end of its outlook to   meet expectations. So much for a   $100 billion quarter    . At least Apple will end up selling roughly $1 billion worth of   products   per day    over the holidays.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reported its Q4 earnings yesterday, and despite topping expectations for both revenue and profit, Apple stock has been taking a beating in after hours trading. At one point, AAPL was down over 7%.Sales of iPhones were flat and the company's projected numbers for the holiday quarter were lower than analysts were looking for, which didn't help. And in a smartphone market that continues to weaken, the company also announced it will no longer release iPhone sales numbers. Or any individual product line sales numbers…Apple reported its Q4 results yesterday evening and there was some good news for investors. Highlights spiked out by the company for the record-breaking quarter included revenue that was up 20%, a 41% increase in EPS and Service revenue that hit the $10 billion mark for the first time. In addition, AAPL says Mac revenue also broke all-time quarterly records, while iPhone and wearables revenue both set Q4 records. In addition, the average sale price (ASP) of the iPhone shot up to $793 on the quarter . That's up 28% from last year's big jump, and way above the $750 range that analysts were expecting.That all sounds pretty positive, so why is Apple stock being hammered?Apple released guidance for Q1 2019 that has revenue between $89 billion and $93 billion. That's slightly lower than analyst expectations of $93.02 billion. And iPhone sales were lower than expected (46.89 million versus 47.5 million), although iPhone revenue was way up at $37.2 billion (compared to $28.8 billion last year), despite the flat growth.But the big story is the company's announcement that starting in Q1, it will no longer break out quarterly unit sales numbers for its products. Investors are worried this is a signal from AAPL that iPhone sales are moving from an era of stagnant growth to one of decline .Back in 2016, AAPL announced it would no longer release launch weekend iPhone sales numbers . That was a metric that investors had relied on, with Apple smashing records year after year. The decision to stop providing that information was taken as a sign that the days of massive iPhone growth were over. No one wanted investor panic if a new iPhone actually failed to beat the launch numbers from a previous year. In Q4 2017, worldwide smartphone sales recorded their first ever quarterly drop . Any hope that was an anomaly were shattered yesterday when IDC released its report for Q3 2018, showing a 6% year-over-year decline , making four straight quarters where global smartphone sales were shrinking.That's a trend, and the trend is not good. At least not if you're an AAPL investor. Launch weekend sales are one thing, but this is a trend that that spells trouble for quarterly iPhone units sold.The phenomenal increase in Apple stock that made it a trillion dollar company was fuelled by iPhone sales that grew at a rapid pace. It makes sense that with the smartphone market softening, the company would try to shift investors focus from that one number. Apple faces similar challenges in other hardware divisions: in Q4 the number of Macs and iPad sold both dropped compared to last year.There was some good news in Other Products, which saw 31% revenue growth - but Apple doesn't release unit sales for that division, so we can't really tell if Apple Watch sales were up, or if the HomePod was a failure. All we know is revenue grew in a big way. And that's what AAPL would rather have investors focus on going forward: revenue instead of unit sales numbers. Doing so not only helps to hide a slide in unit sales (avoiding investor panic), it also makes it tougher to point to specific products as flops.Now that the days of record iPhone sales driving Apple stock are over, the company would rather investors not gauge the performance of the company and its valuation on whether it booked a big increase in number of units sold.And with new Apple product releases including the iPhone XS Max, Apple Watch Series 4, the latest iPad Pro and the new MacBook Air all seeing big price increases , it's clear AAPL has no plans to rely on sales volume alone to boost those revenue numbers.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s.The post Apple Will No Longer Report iPhone Sales - Why You Shouldn't Panic appeared first on InvestorPlace .
It seems that Apple (AAPL) just can’t win with some people. Yesterday, AAPL announced earnings for the third calendar quarter (their financial Q4) that beat expectations on the top and bottom line, yet the stock took a hit and is trading around six percent lower than yesterday’s close in this morning’s premarket.In announcing the spectacular results for last quarter, they once again made clear that the critics who had maintained that higher-priced iPhones would be a disaster were completely wrong, but the naysayers still found reasons to sell.The most obvious reason was a guidance for the holiday quarter that fell short of expectations. Forward guidance tends to have the most influence on stock prices of anything announced by any company, and Apple are forecasting revenue of $89-93 billion versus a consensus estimate of $92.6 billion. That is somewhat disappointing, but in context it should not be enough on its own to justify the decline in price.That context is that guidance from Cupertino tends to be conservative. This forecast for calendar Q4, for example, suggests only about five percent growth from last year’s quarterly record of $88.5 billion. On the earnings call that followed the release Apple execs gave several reasons for that, including forex rates, the timing of product launches that front-loaded some sales and the possibility of an imbalance between supply and demand.Those could all be concerns, but history shows that the company finds a way to deal with problems. They have beaten estimates for EPS in each of the last four quarters, and more importantly, in the last four calendar Q4s.The other thing that is weighing on AAPL this morning is the announcement that the company will no longer break down their sales into units and average selling prices (ASPs) for individual products. It is little wonder that today, when crazy conspiracy theories are so popular at the highest levels of politics, there is a common feeling that this is an attempt to hide something sinister.Reduced transparency is never a good thing, but it could just be that Apple is tired of the nitpicking based on those numbers that seems to follow every beat of expectations. They rightly point out that none of their competitors give that kind of breakdown, and what really matters is the bottom line.As a Wedbush analyst said this morning on CNBC, “we understand the logic of not providing these metrics anymore given that ASPs are all over the map and a slew of new smartphone releases has catalyzed Apple to focus more on overall segment revenue rather than myopic quarterly unit sales.”Regular readers will know that while I have been bearish on AAPL in the past I have had a positive view for a while now, and yesterday’s earnings didn’t change that view. It seems to me that people are overthinking things here. They are viewing solid growth in sales despite some understandable headwinds as a major disappointment and seeing evil intent in the decision to fall in line with competitors in how they report results. As a result, they can’t see the forest for the trees.The simple fact is that Apple grew sales a stunning twenty percent last quarter and is doing that even as they increase margins. They have proven that people will pay the higher prices asked for the new phones and are growing their high-margin services business.As is their wont, they have come up with fairly conservative guidance for next quarter, but as it becomes clear that they will once again beat that over the next couple of months, this dip will, with hindsight, look like a great opportunity to buy stock in the most successful company in the world at a discount.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWednesday's opening gap wasn't a screaming problem on Thursday after all. The S&P 500 managed to log a 1.06% gain yesterday, putting what was likely to be a significant low from Monday further back in the rearview mirror. Still, the buying volume is getting progressively weaker, so don't be shocked should the bears take a swipe. It's what happens after that swipe that matters.Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) was the day's most pleasant surprise, up a whopping 25.8% after swinging back to a nice profit thanks to the relatively new Versa watch. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) was at the other end of the win-loss spectrum … at least after the market closed. Although its 1.5% advance during the regular session was a big boost for the broad market, AAPL tanked in the after-hours session in response to a lackluster fourth quarter iPhone salesand lackluster guidance.It's the kind of volatility that makes both names too tough to trade. Rather, it's stock charts of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), Altria Group (NYSE: MO ) and L Brands (NYSE: LB ) that are dropping hints that traders can at least somewhat trust. Here's a closer look.Exactly one week ago Intel shares had pushed up and off a major support line . It could have been the beginning of something bullish, but as of that time, the stock hadn't fully backed away from the danger of a breakdown.It did in the meantime. And yet, as bullish as INTC may look now, it's been suspiciously unable to hurdle a major technical ceiling.The rally from Altria Group shares since May are the real deal. Although back and forth, in a bigger-picture sense it's been reliable. More than that though, the path MO stock has traveled since bottoming and turning in May has been right as cued by Fibonacci retracement lines, and by Fibonacci fan lines in particular. The stock's due for a dip, but it's pretty clear where those dips are apt to stop and reverse.Finally, the bears had plenty of opportunity and time - and reason - to keep L Brands shares held down. And, with some help from a key moving average line, they've been able to do just that since early this year.Things changed dramatically this week, however, when LB shares finally hurdled the technical ceiling in question. Thursday's high-volume buy-in suggests there may be a bunch of buying pressure waiting in the wings.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Stocks Set for Another Impressive Open as Trade-Fueled Chatter Overshadows Flat iPhone Sales; Jobs Report Crushes Expectations
Fueled by reports that the White House is orchestrating a trade deal with China, US stock futures were catapulted higher overnight with the Dow indicated to open almost 200 point shigher. Weighed down by disappointing Apple ( AAPL  ) after the company said iPhone sales were flat in the third quarter, the Nasdaq has surrendered all of its overnight gains and drifted into negative territory.After a torrid overnight session that saw Dow futures almost 400 points higher, the major indices retreated from their session highs on the heels of a CNBC report denying claims of an imminent trade deal until after the midterm elections. However, futures have since regained traction after the US Labor Department reported that the economy created 250,000 non-farm payrolls last month, comfortably beating expectations of a 190,000 gain.Even more impressive, the annual rate of wage growth reached 3.1%, its highest level since April 2009, as the tight labor market finally translates into higher income for employees.The jobs data upstaged the swelling US trade deficit, now at $54.0 billion, as imports into the US reach a record high. And despite efforts by Washington to curtail Chinese imports, the US trade deficit with China set another record high.During the overnight session, buying erupted in the wake of a Bloomberg report that said the president told his cabinet to draw up a trade deal after his friendly conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Markets across the globe rallied with China's Shanghai soaring almost 3% and the Hang Seng racing more than 4% higher.The trade-fueled rally compensated for bearish European manufacturing data and Apple's quarterly results after Thursday's close. Although reporting better-than-expected Q3 results, investors were disappointed by flat iPhone sales and a 15% drop in iPad sales.

On Friday defensive stocks, which held up relativelyrobustly compared with cyclicals and growth sector during theOctober sell-off, were out of favour, providing the mostpressure on the blue chip index.

Fueled by reports that the White House is orchestrating a trade deal with China, US stock futures were catapulted higher overnight with the major market indices all indicated to open with significant gains. Dow futures are outperforming and are expected to open more than 340 points higher leaving the Nasdaq to lag as a result of disappointing Q4 iPhone sales from Apple ( AAPL  ), which also said it will no longer provide iPhone unit sales data starting with the next quarter.Wall Street was also motivated by the likelihood that the US job market remains strong and wages continue to accelerate. Average hourly earnings are forecast to increase by 0.2% in October, but the more important annual component should top 3% for the first time since 2009. Additionally, the economy is expected to have created 190,000 new non-farm jobs last month, keeping the jobless rate at a decades-low 3.7%.

Stocks Remain Mostly Lower After Early Downturn - U.S. Commentary
  (RTTNews.com) - Stocks have moved mostly lower over the course of the trading session on Friday after failing to sustain an initial move to the upside. The major averages have pulled back into negative territory, giving back ground after moving sharply higher over the past few sessions. Currently, the major averages remain firmly in the red. The Dow is down 113.82 points or 0.5 percent at 25,266.92, the Nasdaq is down 73.91 points or 1 percent at 7,360.15 and the S&P 500 is down 19.04 points or 0.7 percent at 2,721.33. The downturn on Wall Street has been led by Apple ( AAPL ), with the tech giant tumbling by 6.8 percent. Apple is on pace to end the session at a nearly three-month closing low. The steep drop by Apple comes after the company reported fiscal fourth quarter earnings and revenues that exceeded estimates but weaker than expected iPhone shipments. Apple also forecast fiscal first quarter revenues of $89 to $93 billion, with the midpoint below the consensus estimate of $93 billion. The pullback by stocks also reflected waning optimism about a potential agreement to alleviate the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. A Bloomberg report indicating President Donald Trump has asked key U.S. officials to begin drafting potential terms of a trade deal with China contributed to the initial strength on Wall Street. However, three senior administration officials subsequently told CNBC there is no indication of an imminent trade deal, despite some progress being made behind the scenes. Traders are also digesting a closely watched Labor Department report showing stronger than expected job growth in the month of October. The Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment surged up by 250,000 jobs in October after rising by a downwardly revised 118,000 jobs in September. Economists had expected an increase of about 190,000 jobs. The report also said the unemployment rate in October was unchanged from the previous month at 3.7 percent, its lowest level since hitting 3.5 percent in December of 1969. Average hourly employee earnings rose by $0.05 to $27.30 in October, reflecting a 3.1 percent increase compared to the same month a year ago. The annual rate of hourly earnings growth accelerated from 2.8 percent in September, reaching the fastest pace since April of 2009. The upbeat jobs data paints of positive picture for the U.S. economy but has also led to renewed concerns about the outlook for interest rates. "The U.S. jobs market remains incredibly strong and with wages starting to accelerate, domestic price pressures will increase," said ING Chief International Economist James Knightley. He added, "This will keep the Federal Reserve on its path of 'gradual' interest rate hikes with next week's FOMC meeting set to signal a December move." Sector News Natural gas stocks have moved sharply lower over the course of the trading session, dragging the NYSE Arca Natural Gas Index down by 2.1 percent. Within the natural gas sector, Newfield Exploration (NFX) is pulling back sharply after jumping on Thursday after agreeing to be acquired by Encana (ECA) in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $5.5 billion. Significant weakness also remains visible among semiconductor stocks, as reflected by the 1.7 percent slump by the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. The index is giving back ground after moving notably higher over the past few sessions. Commercial real estate, pharmaceutical and utilities stocks are also seeing considerable weakness in mid-day trading, while telecom stocks have pulled back off their best levels but remain notably higher. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved sharply higher during trading on Friday. Japan'sNikkei 225 Index shot up by 2.6 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index spiked by 4.2 percent. The major European markets have also moved to the upside on the day. While the U.K.'sFTSE 100 Index is up by 0.4 percent, the French CAC 40 Index is up by 0.9 percent and the German DAX Index is up by 1.1 percent. In the bond market, treasuries have moved notably lower following the upbeat employment data. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is up by 5.7 basis points at 3.201 percent. For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com 
 On Oct. 30,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) introduced its   third generation of iPad Pro tablets    . These devices represent dramatic upgrades from their   predecessors, sporting an all-new design, new processor,   TrueDepth camera (adding support for Face ID), and support for   the company's new Apple Pencil.They're really good devices that Apple, frankly, has every   reason to be proud of.  Image source: Apple.What's interesting is that when Apple released its   second-generation iPad Pro tablets back in June of 2017, it   simply discontinued the prior-generation models instead of   keeping them around at potentially lower price points. With   this product launch, Apple did something different. Instead of   dropping the older iPad Pro models altogether and offering the   new ones at the same prices as the older models, it kept the   older   10.5-inch model    around with pricing unchanged and introduced the newer models at   higher prices than the price at which their predecessors   launched.Let's go over why Apple would embark on such a strategy.The new iPad Pro tablets are probably significantly more   expensive to produce than their predecessors were -- Apple really   packed these products with a slew of feature upgrades. If this is   the case, Apple likely was faced with two options with respect to   pricing. First, it could keep pricing the same but take a hit on   gross margins and, ultimately, net profitability.The other option would be simply to price the new devices   higher in the hopes that customers would find value in the added   features and be willing to pay more. Those customers who   didn't    find value would then have the choice of buying the older iPad   Pro models at the same prices that they launched at. Apple likely   can get away with that because, to be blunt, the company's   last-generation iPad Pro tablets are already head and shoulders   above competing products.This second option is the one that's most likely to maximize   the profitability of Apple's iPad business. Since Apple has a   history of making smart business decisions that generate fat   profits for its shareholders, it's not surprising that it chose   that route.You might be wondering why Apple didn't keep its older but   larger 12.9-inch iPad Pro around as well. I think the answer is   quite simple. Since Apple didn't reduce the prices on the   10.5-inch model, it would have been inconsistent to decrease the   price of the older 12.9-inch iPad Pro. The device started at $799   for a 64GB version with only Wi-Fi connectivity.In this case Apple would be giving customers a choice between   a large, bulky previous-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro -- the   10.5-inch model is noticeably sleeker with slimmer bezels -- and   the new 11-inch iPad Pro for the same price. I believe that   consumers would overwhelmingly pick the new 11-inch iPad Pro, so   maintaining availability of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, at least   without a price cut, is practically pointless.

Google's top Washington lobbyist stepping down
 By David Shepardson WASHINGTON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Google's top lobbyist in Washington is stepping aside as the U.S. technology company faces criticism on Capitol Hill on issues including privacy protections and its investment plans in China, the Alphabet Inc  unit said on Friday. Former U.S. Representative Susan Molinari, who has run Google'sWashington office and its Americas Policy team for nearly seven years, will move to a new job as senior advisor in January, the company said in a statement. Google is seeking a new head of Americas policy, it added. Alphabet faced criticism from Republicans and Democrats for refusing to send parent company Chief Executive Larry Page or Google CEO Sundar Pichai to a Senate hearing in September, where senators left an empty chair next to Twitter Inc's  CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook Inc's chief operating officer. Pichai in September canceled a trip to Asia to meet with lawmakers and agreed to testify before Congress later this year. Google also has faced this year numerous accusations from President Donald Trump and other Republican leaders that its search results promote content critical of conservatives and demote right-leaning news outlets, a charge that Google denies. Lawmakers have questioned whether it would accept China's censorship demands as it considers reentering the search engine market there. Last month, Vice President Mike Pence called on Google to abandon the Chinese project. Pichai said at a forum on Thursday that the project was "more of an experiment" and reiterated that there is "nothing imminent" on a whether it will launch a search engine in China. In June, Google hired Karan Bhatia as global head of policy from General Electric Co. Bhatia served as deputy U.S. Trade Representative for former President George W. Bush. The company also named Pablo Chavez, a MicrosoftCorp  lobbyist and former senior aide to Republican John McCain, as another senior lobbyist in June. Alphabet said last month it would shut down the consumer version of its failed social network Google+ and tighten its data-sharing policies after announcing that the private profile data of at least 500,000 users might have been exposed to hundreds of external developers. "Google must be more forthcoming with the public and lawmakers if the company is to maintain or regain the trust of the users of its services," three senior Republicans told Google in an Oct. 11 letter. They said they were "especially disappointed" that Google did not disclose the issue at a privacy hearing two weeks earlier. In 2012, Google agreed to pay a then-record $22.5 million civil penalty to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that it misrepresented to users of AppleInc's  Safari internet browser that it would not place tracking "cookies" or serve them targeted ads. 
 
 By David Randall NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Concerns that a trade deal between the U.S. and China may not be imminent reined in a rally in world equity markets and reversed gains on Wall Street on Friday, while strong U.S. wage growth boosted U.S. bond yields. Markets had earlier climbed on hopes that the world's two biggest economies were mending their shaky trade relations. A senior official in the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday dismissed as untrue a media report that said Trump was preparing a possible trade deal with China, a CNBC reporter said in a post on Twitter. "There is a long way to go" on negotiations, the unnamed official told CNBC's Eamon Javers, according to his tweet.  That erased earlier gains in the U.S. stock market and curtailed a rally in global shares that had lifted emerging market stocks up by their largest daily gain since 2016. In Europe, Germany's export-heavy DAX  had jumped as much as 1.5 percent, its best session since July, before giving up most of its gains. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  rose 0.30 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe  gained 0.13 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 125.44 points, or 0.49 percent, to 25,255.3, the S&P 500  lost 20.32 points, or 0.74 percent, to 2,720.05 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 89.41 points, or 1.2 percent, to 7,344.65. Apple's shares tumbled 6.8 percent, taking its market value below $1 trillion, after the iPhone maker warned sales for the crucial holiday quarter would likely miss expectations.  U.S. job growth rebounded sharply in October and wages recorded their largest annual gain in 9-1/2 years, pointing to further labor market tightening that could encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again in December.  Benchmark 10-year notes  last fell 13/32 in price to yield 3.1931 percent, from 3.144 percent late on Thursday. The dollar index, tracking the greenback against six major currencies, rose 0.05 percent, with the euro  up 0.04 percent to $1.1411. Oil prices were weighed down by a report that the U.S. government has agreed to let eight countries, including close allies South Korea and Japan, as well as India, keep buying Iranian oil after Washington re-imposes sanctions.  U.S. crude  fell 0.44 percent to $63.41 per barrel and Brent  was last at $73.04, up 0.21 percent on the day. 
 World shares bounce after bear mauling 
 
  Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) has an incredible internal chip-development   organization, which designs the applications processors for core   products such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. The   capabilities of these processors directly affect the user   experiences that the company delivers, so it's important for it   to continue to engineer cutting-edge chip technologies in support   of these products.Back in September, Apple introduced a trio of new iPhones, all   of which are powered by the   A12 Bionic chip    . The chip incorporated improvements to CPU and graphics   processing unit (GPU) performance, a dramatically faster Neural   Engine for machine-learning calculations, and enhancements to the   image signal processor, which helped Apple deliver a   significantly better camera in these phones versus last year's   iPhones.  A new iPad Pro, with the new A12X Bionic chip. Image source:     Apple.During its product launch on Oct. 30, Apple announced a pair   of new iPad Pro tablets, replacing the aging models that it   introduced in June of 2017. Inside those devices is a chip dubbed   the A12X Bionic -- a beastlier version of the A12 Bionic found in   this year's iPhones.Here's what you need to know about it.The A12 Bionic incorporates two so-called "performance" cores   to process tasks that are more CPU intensive, and four   "efficiency" cores to more efficiently process tasks that don't   need the power that the performance cores bring to the table.Since the A12X is designed specifically for larger devices   with bigger batteries (meaning that it can be allowed to draw   more power than a phone chip can), Apple has kept the number of   efficiency cores at four, but it's doubled the number of   performance cores inside.Apple claims that the A12X Bionic can deliver "up to 35   percent faster single-core performance" and "an up to 90 percent   boost during multithreaded tasks" compared with the A10X Fusion   found in the company's prior-generation iPad Pro tablets.With the A11 Bionic, Apple introduced its first in-house GPU.   The company followed that up with a more powerful   second-generation design with the A12 Bionic. With the A12X   Bionic, Apple is now bringing its in-house GPU chops to its iPad   Pro family of devices.The GPU in the A12X Bionic looks like it's based on the same   fundamental design as the one in the A12 Bionic, but it sports   seven cores instead of the four cores in the A12 Bionic --   something that's undoubtedly enabled by the greater thermal   headroom that a tablet processor has versus a phone   processor.Like the A12 Bionic, the A12X Bionic is manufactured using a   7-nanometer technology    , which means that   Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company     is responsible for building it. The chip, Apple vice   president of hardware engineering John Ternus observes, "has more   than 10 billion transistors."Ternus has also stated that the A12X Bionic-powered iPad Pro   tablets "are faster than 92% of all the portable PCs sold in the   last 12 months, including the most popular Core i7 models from   the top manufacturers."Core i7 is the chip giant   Intel    's highest-end mainstream notebook PC processor (although   for high-power laptops, the company now offers a Core i9 chip,   too)."To put it another way, the iPad Pro delivers Xbox One S-class   graphics performance in a product that's 94% smaller," Ternus   said. "And there's no AC cord required."The A12X Bionic in Apple's new iPad Pros represents an   excellent achievement in silicon engineering. Well done,   Apple.

  (RTTNews.com) - After initially moving to the upside, stocks have come under pressure over the course of morning trading on Friday. The major averages have pulled back well off their highs of the session and into negative territory. Currently, the major averages are all in the red, although the tech-heavy Nasdaq is underperforming its counterparts. While the Nasdaq is down 85.34 points or 1.2 percent at 7,348.72, the Dow is down 63.73 points or 0.3 percent at 25,317.01 and the S&P 500 is down 15.11 points or 0.6 percent at 2,725.26. The downturn on Wall Street is partly due to a sharp drop by shares of Apple ( AAPL ), with the tech giant plunging by 6.5 percent on the day. The steep drop by Apple comes after the iPhone and iPad maker reported fiscal fourth quarter results that exceeded estimates but forecast weaker than expected revenues for the current quarter. Early in the session, buying interest was generated in reaction to a report from the Labor Department showing stronger than expected job growth in the month of October. The Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment surged up by 250,000 jobs in October after rising by a downwardly revised 118,000 jobs in September. Economists had expected an increase of about 190,000 jobs compared to the addition of 134,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month. Meanwhile, the report said the unemployment rate in October was unchanged from the previous month at 3.7 percent, its lowest level since hitting 3.5 percent in December of 1969. Average hourly employee earnings rose by $0.05 to $27.30 in October, reflecting a 3.1 percent increase compared to the same month a year ago. The annual rate of hourly earnings growth accelerated from 2.8 percent in September, reaching the fastest pace since April of 2009. "The U.S. jobs market remains incredibly strong and with wages starting to accelerate, domestic price pressures will increase," said ING Chief International Economist James Knightley. He added, "This will keep the Federal Reserve on its path of 'gradual' interest rate hikes with next week's FOMC meeting set to signal a December move." Traders also reacted positively to a report from Bloomberg indicating President Donald Trump has asked key U.S. officials to begin drafting potential terms of a trade deal with China. People familiar with the matter told Bloomberg the push for a possible trade deal was prompted by Trump's phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday. In a post on Twitter, Trump said he had a "very good" conversation with Xi on trade, adding that the "discussions are moving along nicely." The people told Bloomberg that Trump asked key cabinet secretaries to have their staff draw up a potential deal to signal a ceasefire in an escalating trade conflict. Trump and Xi are expected to meet on the sidelines of a Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina, beginning November 30th. Semiconductor stocks have shown a significant move to the downside on the day, giving back ground after moving notably higher over the past few sessions. Reflecting the pullback by semiconductor stocks, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is slumping by 1.7 percent. Natural gas and commercial real estate stocks have also moved notably lower, while considerable strength remains visible among telecom stocks. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved sharply higher during trading on Friday. Japan'sNikkei 225 Index shot up by 2.6 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index spiked by 4.2 percent. The major European markets have also moved to the upside on the day. While the U.K.'sFTSE 100 Index is up by 0.4 percent, the French CAC 40 Index is up by 0.9 percent and the German DAX Index is up by 1.1 percent. In the bond market, treasuries are pulling back following the upbeat employment data. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is up by 2.8 basis points at 3.172 percent. For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com 
 6:27 a.m. Apple  (AAPL) is down more than 5%, but sometimes the market is bigger than its biggest stock.That's the case this morning as S&P4 500  futures have risen 0.8%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average  futures have gained 234 points, or 0.9%. Nasdaq Composite  futures have advanced 0.2%. Apple's earnings  had caused the major indexes to drop into the red  immediately following its release, but investors have chosen to focus instead on reports that U.S. President Donald Trump has requested his advisors write up a trade deal with China.As big a drag as Apple is, the trade war has been a bigger one. If it really does come to something resembling an end, today's rally might only be the beginning. Write to  Ben Levisohn at  Ben.Levisohn@barrons.com 
 After seven quarters in a row of accelerating revenue growth,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) managed to grow its business even faster in its   fiscal fourth quarter. Revenue soared 20% year over year as the   company benefited from surging iPhone revenue and big gains in   the company's services and "other products" segments.As investors digest the company's strong quarter, which was   reported Thursday, here's a look at some key takeaways from the   period, including why investors shouldn't expect Apple's streak   of accelerating growth to continue in the first quarter of fiscal   2019.  Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller reveals the iPhone XR.     Image source: Apple. Metric  Q4 2018  Q4 2017  Year-Over-Year Change Revenue$62.9 billion$52.6 billion20%Earnings per share$2.91$2.0741%Gross profit margin38.3%37.9%N/AData source: Apple   fourth-quarter operating summary    and   financial statements    .Apple's results demonstrated monstrous momentum, with revenue   rising 20% year over year to $62.9 billion. Not only was this an   acceleration from the 17% revenue growth Apple posted in its   fiscal third quarter, but it was the company's fifth quarter in a   row of double-digit revenue growth.Earnings-per-share growth of 41% year over year was also an   acceleration from 40% growth for the key metric in fiscal Q3.   This significant outsize growth in earnings per share compared   with revenue growth during the period was driven by a combination   of Apple's   aggressive share repurchase program    and gross margin expansion. Apple's gross profit margin expanded   from 37.9% in the year-ago quarter to 38.3%.

Revenue for Apple's smartphone segment   increased an impressive 29% year over year. What's particularly   interesting is that this occurred on flat growth in iPhone unit   sales. This year-over-year gain in iPhone revenue, therefore, was   driven entirely by higher average selling prices for the key   product. The iPhone's average selling price surged from $618 in   the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 to $793 in the fourth quarter   of fiscal 2018.  Data source: Apple fourth-quarter operating summary. Chart     by author.Other standout segments from the period were services and   "other products." Revenue from the two segments increased 17% and   31% year over year, respectively. This extended the two segments'   recent strong momentum    as the services business benefits from fast-rising App Store   sales and the other products segment is aided by surging growth   in wearables products.A glance at Apple's revenue guidance implies the company's   streak of accelerating growth is about to come to an abrupt end.   The tech giant guided for fiscal first-quarter revenue between   $89 billion and $93 billion, representing year-over-year growth   of about 1% to 5%.Despite the expected slowdown in the important holiday   quarter, Apple CEO Tim Cook is confident in the company's product   lineup, which has seen lots of refreshes in two recent Apple   events. "Over the past two months, we've delivered huge   advancements for our customers through new versions of iPhone,   Apple Watch, iPad and Mac as well as our four operating systems,"   Cook said in the company's fourth-quarter earnings release, "and   we enter the holiday season with our strongest lineup of products   and services ever."

 By Vibhuti Sharma and Jasmine I S Nov 2 (Reuters) - Shares in Apple Inc  fell 6 percent on Friday, cutting its market value back to less than $1 trillion after it forecast softer-than-expected sales for the holiday quarter and fueled nerves over iPhone sales by saying it would no longer release the figures. The dip in Apple's shares to $208.50 knocked around $67 billion off its value, and put Amazon and Microsoft Corp  back in the mix in the race among the United States' big tech players to be the world's most valuable company. Most analysts were still upbeat on fourth-quarter results, and there was no obvious fallout for rest of the FAANG group of major U.S. tech stocks. Shares in Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc  and Google-owner Alphabet Inc  all rose on a generally buoyant Wall Street. Eight brokerages cut their price targets for Apple, but only one - Bank of America Merrill Lynch - cut its rating on the stock, to neutral from buy. "Time for investors to adjust to the new disclosures," analysts from the brokerage said. "Although the long term opportunity is significant, we expect near term pressure on shares." The move announced on Thursday to stop reporting unit sales data for iPhones, iPad and Mac computer products was widely criticized, with some arguing it meant Apple expected sales of iPhones have now peaked.  "While the company believes units are a less relevant metric, we strongly disagree - particularly since we believe iPhone units will begin to decline y/y as a result of higher average selling prices," Raymond James analysts said. Apple shares were down 6.4 pct at $208.05 before the bell. 
 
Futures higher on trade deal optimism; jobs data in focus
 By Shreyashi   Sanyal Nov 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures pointed to a fourth day of gains for Wall Street on Friday, fueled by hopes that the United States and China were starting to work toward a resolution of their bitter trade war that has weighed on expectations of global growth, and ahead of the closely watched monthly jobs report. The S&P 500 futures  and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures  pointed to a near 1 percent rise for the indexes at open, but gains in Nasdaq futures  were limited by losses in shares of Apple Inc. But markets got a lift from the latest development on the trade front, as President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping expressed optimism about resolving the trade dispute ahead of a high-stakes meeting at the end of November in Argentina.  The positive signals also triggered a global surge in risk appetite. Shares of trade-sensitive industrial bellwethers, Caterpillar Inc, Boeing Co  and 3M Co, rose between 1 percent and 2.5 percent. The Labor Department's employment report will likely show that U.S. job growth rebounded in October, with wages expected to have recorded their largest annual gain in 9-1/2 years. The report, due at 8:30 a.m. ET (1230 GMT), is also forecast to show the unemployment rate steady at a 49-year low of 3.7 percent. Sustained labor market strength could ease fears about the economy's health following weak housing data and stalling business spending.  At 7:11 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis  were up 242 points, or 0.96 percent. S&P 500 e-minis  were up 19.75 points, or 0.72 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis  were up 8 points, or 0.11 percent. Wall Street had been rocked in October, on fears of a widening global trade dispute, rising borrowing costs and that U.S. earnings growth may slow more than forecast in 2019. Amazon.com Inc, Google-parent Alphabet Inc, Facebook Inc  and Netflix Inc  were trading higher, despite Apple's disappointing forecast. Among other stocks trading before the bell, Starbucks Corp  jumped 9.2 percent after the coffee chain reported same-store sales that beat estimates, benefiting from higher prices in the United States and a rebound in China.  Kraft Heinz Co  dropped 8 percent, after the company missed quarterly earnings estimates on steep commodity costs.

 By Stephen Nellis Nov 1 (Reuters) - First Apple Inc  took away the headphone jack on its iPhones. Then it took away the home button. And now, it has taken away a closely watched performance metric that it has disclosed to investors for 20 years. Apple said the data is less relevant to the strength of its business as customers bundle products, such as an iPhone paired with its wireless AirPods headphones, along with paid subscription services like Apple Music to listen to songs and iCloud storage for photos. Analysts were skeptical. "Companies typically stop reporting metrics when the metrics are about to turn. This is not a good look for Apple," said analyst Walter Piecyk from BTIG Research. The move cost Apple dearly, helping to send shares down about 7 percent in after-hours trading. They later settled at $207.81, about 6.5 percent below their previous close. "Apple is a complex company with lot of moving parts," said analyst Ivan Fienseth from Tigress "I think they need to give more transparency to their shareholders and not less." But now, Apple will give cost-of-sales data for both its total product businesses and its total services business, which will let investors evaluate a gross margin for both. In the past, Apple gave only an overall gross margin figure for the company. The new numbers are important for two reasons. First, they will show just how lucrative Apple's hardware business really is. But more importantly, for the first time they give margin information on Apple's services business, which reached $10 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter, up 17 percent. Many of Apple's fastest-growing businesses are subscription based, like its $9.99 a month Apple Music service. And investors tend to value subscription business through a combination of their revenue growth rate and margins - information that Apple investors will now have, said Tien Tzuo, chief executive of Zuora Inc, a company that helps subscription businesses track their finances. But one problem Apple investors will face is not knowing what the margin mix is within the services business. Some parts of it, like iCloud storage, are likely lucrative, but others, like Apple Music, are probably less so because Apple has to pay music licenses costs and competes with rival Spotify Technology SA. "You would value the music business with one (revenue) multiple closer to Spotify, and the cloud business with a (subscription software) multiple," said Tzuo. "Having some sense of which business is growing faster would be nice." 
 
 By Julien Ponthus LONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - European shares joined a global relief rally on Friday after after U.S. President Donald Trump fueled hopes among investors that a deal to end a prolonged dispute over trade could be made with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping later this month. The pan-European STOXX 600  rose 0.9 percent by 0936 GMT, hitting its highest since Oct. 10, although companies and indexes most exposed to trade surged further. Fears of a full-blown trade war, rising U.S. bond yields, slowing Chinese growth, political risk in the form of Brexit or Italy's populist government have all been blamed for last month "red October" during which indexes worldwide sustained some of their worst losses since the 2008 financial crisis. Markets' new found optimism is however pushing European shares up over four percent this week, their best performance since December 2016.  Germany's DAX  jumped 1.6 percent, in what would be its biggest daily rise since July, lifted by the big exporters among its constituents, such as car maker Volkswagen, up 4 percent. The European automotive index  was the best performing one, jumping 3.5 percent and all other sectors were in positive territory except for a minority of defensive sectors. Both telecoms or utilities traded slightly or on the verge of negative territory.   Boosted by a upgrade from Goldman Sachs, France'sKering topped the euro zone blue chip index  with a 5.5 percent rise. Other luxury stocks such as LVMH  or Burberry  did well, up 3.1 percent and 3.5 percent.   Following Asia's lead, European tech stocks shrugged off Apple's  disappointing results, which saw the iPhone marker's shares tumbled about seven percent after the bell.  Apple supplier AMS however was down 5.3 percent and suffered the worst losses in the pan-European index.  The banking sector  was showing no angst about the results of European stress tests which will be divulged after the close. Italian lenders are under the spotlight with their heavy exposure to sovereign Italian debt, which is suffering from the populist government's spending plans and its row with the EU's executive body. 
 
 By Andrew Galbraith and Hideyuki Sano SHANGHAI/TOKYO, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Asian shares rocketed to three-week highs on Friday while the dollar softened on a report that U.S. President Donald Trump is taking steps to resolve a damaging trade war with China that has cast a pall over the global economy and financial markets recently. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  jumped 2.7 percent to hit its highest level since Oct. 10. It is up 6.4 percent on the week, on course to mark its best weekly performance in three years. "Asia is the most sensitive to trade wars so Asian shares naturally have the most to gain from the prospects of a trade deal," said Makoto Sakuma, researcher at NLI Research Institute in Tokyo. Japan's Nikkei stock index  rose 2.6 percent higher while U.S. S&P500 e-mini futures  rose 0.7 percent. European stocks are expected to follow suit, with financial spread-betters seeing Britain's FTSE  rising 0.9 percent and France's CAC  and Germany's DAX  1.0 percent each. Chinese shares surged and the yuan firmed. Chinese blue-chips  gained 3.3 percent, and its start-up board  added 4.5 percent, also buoyed by President Xi's pledge on Thursday of more support for private firms.  MSCI China  gained 7.9 percent so far this, about the double the 3.5 percent gains in MSCI's broadest gauge of global stocks, ACWI. Bloomberg reported that Trump is interested in reaching a trade agreement with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 nations summit in Argentina later this month and has asked key U.S. officials to begin drafting potential terms, citing people familiar with the matter. One person said a sticking point in any potential deal is intellectual property theft, where the Trump administration has sought to take a hard line, and it was unclear if Trump was easing up on U.S. demands that China has resisted. Earlier this week, Trump was quoted as saying Beijing wasn't ready to do a deal and he was prepared to slap more tariffs on China if his meeting with Xi was not productive. The Bloomberg report came after the two leaders expressed optimism on Thursday about resolving their bitter trade disputes, one of the major factors behind a recent global equity market rout.  "While we are still cautious over a full resolution of recent tensions in the medium term, resumption of dialogue between Washington and Beijing would be good enough to investors for now," said Tai Hui, chief market strategist, Asia Pacific, at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. "The next four weeks between the U.S. mid-term elections and the G20 meeting in Argentina on Nov 30 will be important to see how things progress."      On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  and the S&P 500  each gained 1.06 percent while  the Nasdaq Composite  rallied 1.75 percent. A combination of bargain-hunting following steep losses in equities last month and some strong corporate earnings have helped power Wall Street's bounce. After the bell, though, shares of Apple  tumbled about 7.0 percent after it said sales for the crucial holiday quarter could miss Wall Street expectations due to weakness in emerging markets and foreign exchange costs. Apple suppliers in Asia largely shrugged off the news as investors hoped some progress was being made on trade. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co  gained 1.4 percent, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co  added 0.4 percent. Tech rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  also rallied, rising 4.7 percent. 
 IN THE (DATA) DUMPS Investors will be looking ahead to a U.S. jobs report, due at 1230 GMT, for more indications on the health of the U.S. economy and the clues on the pace of further interest rate rises. U.S. nonfarm payroll figures are expected to rise 190,000 in October from 134,000 a month earlier, with average hourly earnings seen increasing 0.2 percent in October after a 0.3 percent gain the previous month. Those numbers follow data this week revealing slower factory growth around the world, adding to worries about the outlook for corporate earnings, business investment and trade. Data from the U.S. showed cooling manufacturing activity in October as a measure of new orders hit a 1-1/2 year low. That came after manufacturing surveys showed factory activity and export orders weakening across Asia as the impact of the trade war deepened.  In currency markets, the dollar eased off as improved risk sentiment helped to boost other currencies. The yuan strengthened to a high of 6.9092 per dollar in onshore markets  and also firmed in offshore trade, pulling away from the sensitive 7 level. The euro edged up 0.15 percent to $1.1426  while the risk-sensitive Australian dollar gained 0.5 percent to $0.7240. The dollar gained 0.3 percent against the safe-haven yen to 113.00 yen. Oil prices reversed earlier losses, with U.S. crude  flat at $63.73 a barrel. Brent crude  was 0.5 percent higher at $73.24. 
 
 
European Shares Set To Open On Steady Note
  (RTTNews.com) - European stocks may open higher on Friday, with sentiment likely to remain supported by signs of potential progress in U.S.-China trade relations and hopes for China stimulus. Technology stocks could be in focus after underwhelming news from Apple Inc. Asian stocks extended gains and remain on track to post their biggest weekly rally since July 2016 after comments from U.S. President Donald Trump suggested the door is still open for U.S-China trade talks. Benchmark indexes in China, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan climbed 2-3 percent. The dollar steadied ahead of the closely watched U.S. jobs report later in the day, with economists expecting employment to climb by 190,000 jobs in October after an increase of 134,000 jobs in September. The jobless rate is expected to hold at 3.7 percent. It will be the final jobs report before next Tuesday's congressional elections. Factory Purchasing Managers' survey data from euro area is due later in the session, headlining a light day for the European economic news. Gold held steady after a 1.5 percent gain in the previous session, while oil remained on track for its biggest weekly loss since February on signs of rising U.S. supply and amid concerns that the U.S.-China trade war would dent fuel demand in the near term. Overnight, U.S. stocks rose to extend gains from the previous two sessions after Trump said he had a "long and very good" conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping on trade and North Korea, and that the two planned to meet at the upcoming G-20 summit. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1.1 percent, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped as much as 1.8 percent and the S&P 500 added 1.1 percent. European markets ended Thursday's session with mixed results as investors digested encouraging corporate earnings results, the BoE rate decision and reports of Brexit breakthrough. The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index rose 0.4 percent. The German DAX also inched up 0.2 percent, while France's CAC 40 index and the U.K.'sFTSE 100 both dipped 0.2 percent.

 By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Asian shares jumped to three-week highs on Friday and U.S. equity futures rebounded on a report that U.S. President Donald Trump has asked officials to draft terms for a potential trade deal with China following a phone call with leader Xi Jinping.

It gained 0.3 percent against the safe-haven yen to 113.04 yen  but otherwise it was under pressure as improved risk sentiment helped to boost other currencies. The dollar had fallen across the board on Thursday as the pound rallied on reports that London is close to sealing a financial services deal with Brussels, and after the Bank of England hinted at slightly rate rises in future.  "A corrective setup is in place for the USD, with overbought valuations and a series of reversals across various currency pairs arguing for a short-term pullback," RBC Capital Markets analysts said in a note. The pound  stood flat on Friday at to $1.2997. U.S. crude  was flat at $63.68 a barrel. Brent crude  was 0.2 percent higher at $73.04.

Tim Cook    --   Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Nancy. Good afternoon everyone and thanks for   joining us. I just got back from Brooklyn where we marked our   fourth major launch of the end of the year. In addition to being   a great time, it put an exclamation point at the end of a   remarkable fiscal 2018. This year we shipped our 2 billion iOS   device, celebrated the 10th anniversary of the App Store and   achieved the strongest revenue and earnings in Apple's   history.In fiscal year '18 our revenue grew by $36.4 billion, that's   the equivalent of a Fortune 100 company in a single year, and   recapping all that all with our best September quarter ever.   Revenue was $62.9 billion, ahead of our expectation. That's an   increase of 20% over last year and our highest growth rate in   three years. We also generated record Q4 earnings with 41%   year-over-year growth in EPS. Record results from iPhone,   Services and Wearables drove our momentum and we produced strong   double-digit revenue growth in all of our geographic segment.It was a big year and a big quarter for iPhone. Q4 revenue was   up 29% over last year, an increase of over $8 billion to a new   September quarter record, fueled by continued momentum for iPhone   8, 8 Plus and 10 and the very successful launch of iPhone XS and   iPhone XS Max.These latest devices are our most advanced iPhones ever, with   the industry's first 7 nanometer A12 Bionic chip with an Apple   design 8-core neural engine capable of executing an astounding   five trillion operations per second. The A12 Bionic is many years   in the making and a huge technological leap forward. It sets the   iPhone experience far apart from the competition, using real-time   machine learning to transform the way we experienced photos,   gaming, augmented reality and more. It makes full use of the dual   camera system that shoots portrait mode photos with smart HDR and   dynamic depth of field and Face ID is even faster. The response   has been powerful.As one reviewer put it, iPhone XS and XS Max are the perfect   blend of design and craftsmanship as well as seamlessly intuitive   user experience. We're not done yet. Just last week, we began   shipping iPhone XR, bringing the latest iPhone breakthroughs to   even more users with an all-screen glass and aluminum design and   the most advanced LCD in a smartphone, the product reviews have   been overwhelmingly mainly positive.iOS 12 has gotten off to an incredible start. It's been   installed on more systems in its first month in any version of   iOS ever. iOS 12 is delivering systemwide performance   enhancements Siri Shortcuts and new tools to help people reduce   interruptions and manage screen time for themselves and their   kids. Siri shortcuts in particular is already deeply integrated   with some of the most popular apps out there. Whether you're   tracking your workouts or rushing to catch a flight, you can be   sure, all of your most relevant apps are working together with   Siri in the driver seat.iOS 12 also features a ARKit 2, a major upgrade to our   augmented reality engine. ARKit 2 makes possible simultaneous   multi-user experiences and real world object incorporation. Our   developer community is really running with this technology. From   gaming to shopping, we're seeing great new use cases emerge. iOS   devices delivered the best AR experiences of any products in the   market today, and with the announcement of our new iPad Pro this   week, we've made that gap even wider. More powerful than the vast   majority of PC laptops, the new iPad Pro is unrivaled in its   versatility and performance compared with the beautifully refined   Apple Pencil and a new streamlined full-sized smart keyboard,   iPad Pro will extend its lead as the ultimate creativity and   productivity device.And finally, just this week we delivered the highly   anticipated Group FaceTime functionality to all FaceTime enabled   devices. For services, it was our best quarter ever with revenue   of $10 billion. Excluding the impact of a favorable onetime   accounting adjustment of $640 million a year ago, our services   growth was 27%. We set new Q4 records in all of our geographic   segments and new all time revenue records for the App Store,   Cloud Services, Apple care, Apple Music and Apple Pay. We also   continue to see strong growth in paid subscriptions reaching over   330 million in our ecosystem.I want to spotlight the exceptional performance of Apple Pay   which is by far the number one mobile contactless payment service   worldwide. Transaction volume tripled year-over-year. And to put   that into perspective, Apple Pay generated significantly more   transactions than even PayPal Mobile with over four times the   growth rate. As a testament to accelerating US growth, Costco   completed the roll out Apple Pay to over 500 US warehouses last   quarter while Neiman Marcus is now accepting Apple Pay at over 40   stores across the country.With these additions, 71 of the top 100 merchants and 60% of   all US retail locations support Apple Pay. We continue to invest   in our strategy to replace the wallet with the recent launches   student ID passes at several major US universities. And 10 months   following its launch, Apple Pay Cash is the highest rated mobile   peer-to-peer service by consumer reports, based on exceptional   payment authentication and data privacy.We set an all-time quarterly record for Mac revenue. Thanks to   strong performance of MacBook Pro and the impact of the   back-to-school season. In September we delivered macOS Mojave,   bringing powerful new features to Mac like dark mode stacked in a   completely redesigned Mac App Store. Considered alongside the   release of iOS 12, watchOS 5 and a new TV OS, macOS Mojave tells   a powerful story of the seamless integration of world-class   hardware, software and services that define the Apple   ecosystem.As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, earlier this week   we announced exciting updates to the Mac lineup. The all-new   MacBook Air brings a stunning retina display, Touch ID, the   latest processors and an even more portable design to the world's   most beloved notebook.We also unveiled the biggest update ever to Mac mini, the   small yet muscular desktop that powers everything from the music   and sound effects at broadway shows to the developers who build   some of the most popular apps in the App Store.The new Mac Mini boast an amazing five times faster   performance than before. With revenue growth over 50%, it was   another record quarter for wearables which includes Apple Watch,   AirPods and Beats product. With the highest customer satisfaction   in the industry, Apple Watch has become an essential part of   people's lives. The customer response to the Apple Watch Series 4   has been overwhelmingly positive, driven by it's all new design,   larger display, faster performance, fall detection, enhanced   cellular reception and electrical heart sensor.Later this year, the ECG app will be available to Apple Watch   Series 4 customers in the US, giving them the ability to take an   electric cardiogram anytime, right from their wrist. And for US   customers with Apple Watch Series 1 and later watchOS will soon   enable periodic checks for a regular heart rhythms that may be   suggestive of AFib. These are unprecedented and potentially   life-changing features, showing how Apple Watch is not only an   indispensable communication and fitness companion but also an   intelligent guardian for your health.More broadly, we see this as just one further example of the   kind of contribution we can make in the health space and we look   forward to making more in the future. We are proud to bring home   HomePod to new customers. I was in Spain last week as HomePod   became available there and in Mexico. HomePod delivers the   highest fidelity audio quality working together with an Apple   Music subscription to stream over 50 million songs into any room   of your home.Our retail team posted record Q4 results to conclude their   biggest year ever. They are transforming our stores into places   where customers come to connect learn and be inspired together   with people from their community. Our Today at Apple sessions are   terrific example of what that looks like in practice. We hosted   over 250,000 Today at Apple sessions this quarter, connecting   aspiring creators with local photographers, illustrators and   other experts who can help them get the most out of their   devices.Apple stores also hosted 74,000 kids at Apple Camp. The   relationship Apple has with our customers is about more than just   making a purchase. With the recent addition of beautiful new   stores in Italy, Japan, China and in just a few weeks Thailand,   we will have 506 stores where we can further those relationships,   almost half of which are outside the United States.Before I turn the call over to Luca, I'd like to touch on two   items that may not show up in our financial statement but are   just as integral to Apple's mission and our commitment to making   the world a better place. First, education. More than 5,000   schools, community colleges and technical colleges worldwide are   now using Everyone Can Code, our free coding curriculum. Ideas,   creativity and passion for technologies potential aren't limited   by ZIP code or country and we don't think opportunity should be   either. We're also excited that educators in more than 350   schools around the world have started working with Everyone Can   Create, the free collection of tools and project guides we   introduced this Spring, designed to help unleash kids creativity   throughout their school day with the help of iPad.Next is the environment. This was a milestone year for Apple's   commitment to our planet. In April, we announced that 100% of our   global operations are powered by renewable energy. We also made   progress in doing the same in our supply chain. And just this   week, we announced that the inclosures of new products like   MacBook Air and iPad Pro will be made from 100% recycled   aluminium, a strong, durable and beautiful new alloy designed by   Apple. This is a great example of how our commitment to do right   on the issues that matter can drive one's unimaginable   innovation, new ways of approaching old problems and beautiful   solutions that set us apart.I'd like to thank all of our employees, customers, developers   and business partners for helping us deliver outstanding results   across our fiscal 2018. We are headed into the holidays with our   strongest product lineup ever and we could not be more bullish   about Apple's future.And now, Luca has more details to share with you on the   September quarter. Luca? Luca Maestri    --   Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We are extremely   pleased to report the record results for our September quarter,   which capped a tremendously successful fiscal 2018, a year in   which we saw double-digit revenue growth in every geographic   segments and established new revenue and earnings records in   every single quarter.Revenue in the fourth quarter was $62.9 billion, up 20% and   more than $10 billion over last year, with strong double-digit   growth in each of our geographic segments and record Q4 revenue   in the Americas, in Europe, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. In   fact, we set new revenue records in almost every market we track,   with especially strong growth in Germany, Italy, Sweden,   Switzerland, Japan and Korea, all major markets where revenue   growth was 25% or higher. We also set new fourth quarter revenue   records for iPhone and wearables, a new all-time records for   Services and Mac.Gross margin was 38.3%, flat sequentially and in line with our   expectations as leverage from higher revenue offset seasonal   transition costs. We set new September quarter records for net   income, EPS and cash flow from operations. Net income was $14.1   billion, up $3.4 billion or 32% over last year. Diluted earnings   per share were $2.91, up 41%. Cash flow from operations was $19.5   billion, up $3.8 billion from a year ago.iPhone revenue grew 29% with growth of more than 20% in every   geographic segment. iPhone ASP was $793 compared to $618 a year   ago, driven by strong performance of iPhone X, iPhone 8, iPhone 8   Plus, as well the successful launch of iPhone XS and iPhone XS   Max in the September quarter this year while we launched iPhone X   in the December quarter last year.We sold 46.9 million iPhones during the quarter, with growth   of 20% or more in several markets, including Japan, Australia,   New Zealand, Sweden Norway, Chile and Vietnam. Customer   satisfaction with iPhone continues to be outstanding and it's the   highest in the industry. The latest survey of US consumers from   451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone X,   iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus combined, and among business buyers   who plan to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 80%   plan to purchase iPhones.Turning to Services. It was our best quarter ever, in total   and virtually in every market around the world with revenue of   $10 billion. A year ago, we had a one-time $640 million favorable   impact to Services revenue due to an accounting adjustment. And   taking that into account, our services growth in Q4 this year was   27%. As Tim mentioned, we reached new all-time quarterly revenue   record for many services categories and we are well on our way to   achieve our goal to double our fiscal 2016 services revenue by   2020.We now have over 330 million paid subscriptions on our   platform, an increase of over 50% versus a year ago. We are very   pleased, not only with the growth, but also with the breadth of   our subscription business. In fact, 30,000 third-party   subscription apps are available on the App Store today and the   largest of them all represents less than 0.3% of our total   services revenue.Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We saw great response to   our new MacBook Pro models that we launched in July with strong   double-digit revenue growth, driving an all-time quarterly record   for Mac revenue. We were especially pleased with Mac momentum in   emerging market with strong growth in Latin America, in India,   the Middle East and Africa and Central and Eastern Europe. At   over 100 million units, our active installed base of Mac is at an   all-time high and the majority of customer purchasing Macs in the   September quarter were new to Mac.We sold 9.7 million iPads during the quarter, gaining share in   nearly every market we track, based on the latest estimates from   IDC. We generated iPad growth in a number of key regions around   the world, including Latin America, Europe, Japan, the India and   South Asia. Among customers around the world purchasing iPads   during the quarter, nearly half were new to iPad and our active   installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high.NPD indicates that iPad has 58% share of the US tablet market   in the September quarter, up from 54% share a year ago. And the   most recent customer consumer survey from 451 Research measured,   iPad customer satisfaction ratings of 96% for both iPad and iPad   Pro. And among business customers, who plan to purchase tablets   in the December quarter, 74% plan to purchase iPads.Other Products revenue grew 31% to a new September quarter   record, with an increase of over $1 billion compared to a year   ago. Thanks to wearables growth of over 50% and the strong   performance of Apple TV, in addition to the introduction of   HomePod earlier this year.As we look back across fiscal 2018, we have made great   progress in the enterprise market where iOS is transforming our   business gets done across multiple industries. In fact, over 450   airlines and 47 of the top 50 around the world have adopted iOS   to have pilots life safer, more efficient flight and many   airlines are also using iOS to support better customer   experiences and improve maintenance operations. We're also making   great strides in the retail sector where nine of the top 10   global retailers use iOS devices to transform their customer and   employee experiences.We are seeing industry wide adoption of iOS at thousands of   retailers from neighborhood boutiques to many of the best-known   retailers in the world. Deployment of iOS devices is growing   steadily as retailers replaced their traditional point of sales   systems and use custom iOS apps on iPhones and iPad to provide a   highly personalized shopping experiences.Our success in enterprise is supported by our key   partnerships. Since launching our first strategic partnership   with IBM, 240 large customers have signed MobileFirst for iOS   deals. Additionally, earlier in the year, we introduced two new   technology offerings. IBM Watson services for Core ML and the IBM   Cloud Developer Console for Apple, that are enabling businesses   to combine machine learning and cloud for a new generation of   dynamic, smart apps made for iOS. Over 60 new signings across   numerous industries have been added since launching these new   tools.In our new partnership with salesforce, we're excited to bring   together the number one customer relationship management platform   in iOS. Together with Apple Salesforce is redesigning its apps to   embrace the native mobile platform with exclusive new features on   iOS. The companies will also provide tools and resources for   millions of Salesforce developers to build their own native apps   with the new Salesforce mobile SDK for iOS.And finally, we recently announced Apple Business Manager, a   new way for IT teams to deploy Apple devices at scale. The   response from companies around the world has been tremendous with   over 40,000 companies currently enrolled.Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter   with $237.1 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We also   had $102.5 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial   paper outstanding for a net cash position of $122.6 billion. As   explained earlier this year, it is our plan to reach a net cash   neutral position over time. As part of this plan, we returned   over $23 billion to investors during the quarter. We repurchased   92.5 million Apple shares for $19.4 billion through open market   transactions and we paid $3.5 billion in dividends and   equivalents.For our fiscal year 2018, revenue grew over $36 billion to   $265.6 billion, an all-time record. Every geographic segments   grew double-digits with new records in the Americas, Europe,   Japan and rest of Asia Pacific. We also set new all-time records   for net income up 23% versus last year and EPS up 29%. And we   returned a total of almost $90 billion to our investors during   the year, including almost $14 billion in dividends and   equivalents and over $73 billion in share repurchases.Before we discuss our December quarter outlook, I'd like to   describe a number of changes in our financial reporting that we   are implementing as we enter our new fiscal year. First, given   the increased importance of our Services business and in order to   provide additional transparency to our financial results, we will   start reporting revenue as well as cost of sales for both total   products and total services beginning this December quarter.   Second, also beginning this December quarter, we are adopting the   FASB's new standard for revenue recognition. This will not result   in any change to our total revenue, but it will impact the way we   report the classification of revenue between products and   services. In particular the revenue corresponding to the   amortization of the deferred value of bundled services such as   maps, Siri and free iCloud services was previously reported in   product revenue. After adopting the new standard, this revenue   will now be reported in Services revenue. The change in   classification between products and services will also apply to   the costs that are associated with the delivery of such bundled   services.After we file our 10-K, we will post a scheduled to our   Investor Relations website, showing the reclassification of   fiscal 2018 revenue from products to services, in connection with   the adoption of the new standard. The size of this   reclassification amounts to less than 1% of total company   revenue. And for clarity this reclassification was not   contemplated in our previously stated goal of doubling our fiscal   '16 services revenue by 2020, that goal remains unchanged and   excludes the revenue is now shifting from products to services   over that timeframe. Third, starting the December quarter, we   will no longer be providing unit sales data for iPhone, iPad and   Mac.As we have stated many times, our objective is to make great   products and services that enrich people's lives and to provide   an unparalleled customer experience so that our users are highly   satisfied, loyal, and engaged. As we accomplish these objectives,   strong financial results follow.As demonstrated by our financial performance in recent years,   the number of units sold in any 90-day period is not necessarily   representative of the underlying strength of our business.   Furthermore a unit of sale is less relevant for us today than it   was in the past given the breadth of our portfolio and the wider   sales price dispersion within any given product line. Fourth,   starting with the December quarter, we will be renaming, the   other products category to wearables, home, and accessories to   provide a more accurate description of the items that are   included in this product category.As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review   our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking   information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.   We have the strongest lineup ever as we enter the holiday season   and we expect revenue to be between $89 billion and $93 billion,   a new all-time record. This range reflect a number of factors to   be considered. First we consider the effect on Q4 and Q1 of the   launch timing of our new iPhones this year versus last year.   Second we expect almost $2 billion of foreign exchange headwinds.   Third, we have an unprecedented number of products ramping and   while our ramps are going fairly well, we have uncertainty around   supply and demand balance and fourth we also faced some   macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly in emerging markets.We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect   OpEx to be between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. We expect   OI&E to be about $300 million and we expect the tax rate to   be about 16.5% before discrete items. Also today, our Board of   Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.73 per share of   common stock, payable on November 15, 2018 with shareholders of   record as of November 12, 2018.With that I'd like to open the call to questions. Nancy Paxton    --   Senior Director of Investor Relations Thank you, Luca. And we'd like to ask that you limit yourself   to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question   please. Operator Certainly. Our first question will come from Wamsi Mohan with   Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Wamsi Mohan    --   Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Yes. Thank you. Tim there has been some real deceleration in   some of these emerging markets, partly driven by some concerns   around some of the rules, administration is contemplating and   partly driven by things that are more specific to China, for   instance, like some of the regulations around gaming. So can you   talk about how you see the trajectory there for the business and   what you think of the initiatives of some companies like Netflix   and Fortnite trying to bypass the App Store around subscriptions   and I have a follow up. Tim Cook    --   Chief Executive Officer Sure. Great question. Starting with emerging markets. The   emerging markets that we are seeing pressure in our markets like   Turkey, India, Brazil, Russia. These are markets where currencies   have weekend over the recent period, in some cases that resulted   in us raising prices and those markets are not growing the way we   would like to see. To give you a perspective at some detail, our   business at India in Q4 was flat. Obviously, we would like to see   that'd be a huge growth. Brazil was down somewhat compared to the   previous year, and so I think at least the way that I see this is   each one of the emerging markets has a bit of a different story.   And I don't see it as an some sort of issue that is common   between those for the most part. In relation to China   specifically, I would not put China in that category. Our   business in China was very strong last quarter. We grew 16%,   which we're very happy with. iPhone in particular was very   strong. Very strong double-digit growth there. Our other products   category was also stronger, in fact a bit stronger than even the   company, overall company number.The App Store in China, we have seen a slowdown or a   moratorium to be more accurate on new game approvals. There is a   new regulatory setup in China and there are not moving the way   they were moving previously. We did see a few games approved   recently, but it's very far below the historic pace. And as   you've probably seen some of the larger companies there that are   public have talked about this, as they've announced their   earnings as well. We don't know exactly when this will, the   approvals will sort of return to a normal pace. So I would not   want to predict that. I do not view -- just for avoidance of   doubt here, I don't view that issue has anything to do with the   trade related discussions between the countries. I think that is   strictly a domestic issue in China.In terms of larger developers, if you sort of step back and   look at the value proposition for people from the App Store,   there are two key constituencies in that equation, there's the   user and there's the developer. If you start with the user, what   the App Store provides people is sort of the best and safest   place for users to get at. And we put a -- we have a tremendous   process and infrastructure around achieving that and we where it   is not perfect, we wind up, reviewing 100,000, over 100,000 apps   per week between new apps and updates for existing app and then   work with developers quickly to fix the issues and we also   provide the user a one-payment model for purchasing apps and   subscriptions and in-app purchases, et cetera, et cetera. They   are not in a position that they have to share their private   information across many companies. And so that's sort of the   proposition for the user. For the developer, we obviously provide   the developers, a tremendous amount of developer tools, programs,   compilers languages, of course the operating system APIs, SDK and   have a huge developer relations team. And we do a tremendous   amount of marketing for developers including the new Today   editorial that we just started in the past few months, personal   recommendation, search tools and so on and so forth.If -- there will be, there's no doubt in my mind, there have   already been some large developers that concluded that they could   do something on their own, we're fine with that. I think Luca   mentioned in his comments that the largest, if I look at the   largest developer, they make up less than 0.3% of the services   revenue. So it's probably good to think about that in that   context, and there are millions of apps on the store obviously   and 30,000 or so subscription apps. And so the subscription   business itself is nearly as broad as the App Store itself is.   And so that's the value proposition. I think that the vast   majority of people are very happy with it and including the most   important people at all, which is the user. Wamsi Mohan    --   Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Thank you, Tim. I appreciate the response. If I could just ask   you really quick on Apple's role in healthcare, it's been growing   significantly since the early introduction in the Watch and then   the various kits for developers, including HealthKit, CareKit   etcetera. And when you combine that with your restaunch advocacy   for privacy, I see, Apple could become a really large this   intermediating force in all the friction in the healthcare   industry today in the way, medical information is shared and   distributed. Is this the way that you see the future for Apple   and healthcare, and do you see a means to also grow your services   business through the healthcare offerings that could become   subscriptions to your customers? Thank you. Tim Cook    --   Chief Executive Officer I think Apple has a huge opportunity in the -- in health. And   you can see from the, our past several years that we have intense   interest in the space and are adding products and services,   non-monetized services so far to that and I don't want to talk   about the future because I don't want to give away what we're   doing but this is an area of major interest to us. Thank you. Nancy Paxton    --   Senior Director of Investor Relations Thank you Wamsi. Could we have the next question, please. Operator Shannon Cross from Cross Research has the next question. Shannon Cross    --   Cross Research -- Analyst Thank you very much for taking the question. Given the $4   billion range in revenue that you're giving for the quarter and   all of the, all the things that are going on the world right now,   can you maybe give a little detail about the variables that you   took into account when you were coming up with this, geopolitical   trade macro component costs, I don't know if you can just give us   some ideas of what the puts and takes were? Thank you. Luca Maestri    --   Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes, Shannon, I'll take this one. At the revenue level, we   started from the fact that, we are very, very excited about the   lineup of products and services that we have, getting into the   holiday season. It's a strongest lineup that we've ever had, and   our guidance range by the way represent a new all-time quarterly   revenue record. As I explained in my prepared remarks, there are   a number of things that need to be considered as part of this   guidance range. The first one is, the fact that the launch timing   of the new iPhones this year is essentially in reverse order   versus last year. And that has had an effect on Q1 -- on Q4 and   we'll have an effect on Q1. Last year we launched the top end of   our iPhone lineup, which was iPhone 10 during Q1 and placed the   entirety of the channel field for iPhone 10 in Q1. This year, we   launched the top end of the lineup, which is the XS and the XS   Max during Q4. Obviously, this resulted in a more pronounced ASP   growth in Q4 of '18 and obviously a tougher compare for Q1. So I   think it's important to keep that in mind as you look at the   revenue guidance that we provided.The second point that needs to be kept in mind, it is a fact   of live and we've dealt with for a number of years now, is the   fact that when I look at currencies around the world, virtually   every foreign currency has depreciated against the US dollar in   the last 12 months. And when we look at the impact of foreign   exchange on our revenue for the December quarter, we are looking   at 200 basis points of headwinds, which translates given our, the   size of our business to almost $2 billion of headwind to our   revenue.The third point that I think it's important to keep in mind,   and Tim has talked about this, we are launching -- in the last   six weeks we've launched an unprecedented number of new products.   They're all ramping right now. The ramps are going fairly well   but obviously we have some uncertainty around supply demand   balance for some of these products. And then, finally the last   point that we've taken into account is what Tim has talked about   in terms of some level of uncertainty at the macroeconomic level   in some emerging markets where clearly consumer confidence is not   as high as it was 12 months ago. So take that into account, and   that's how we got to the range. Shannon Cross    --   Cross Research -- Analyst Okay. Thank you. And then, I just want to talk a little bit   about the pullback in terms of guidance from a unit perspective.   I understand, you don't want to give guidance because 90 days is   a short period of time, and it can be -- fluctuate. But what kind   of qualitative commentary do you think you'll be able to provide,   because it's obviously, investors have spent the last, however   many years going P times Q. So how should we think about, what we   can expect and sort of how, how are you going to manage this   process as we go through? I know it's all our job to forecast,   but -- Luca Maestri    --   Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Let me walk you through the rationale that we've used,   and then I'll talk about this qualitative commentary that you   were mentioning. As I said our objective is to make great   products provide the best customer experience and get our   customer satisfied, engaged and loyal to our ecosystem. When you   look at our financial performance in recent years, take the last   three years for example, the number of units sold during any   quarter has not been necessarily preventative of the underlying   strength of our business,if you look at our revenue during the   last three years, if you look at our net income during the last   three years, if you look at our stock price in the last three   years, there is no correlation to the units sold in any given   period.As you know very well, in addition, our product ranges for all   the major product categories become wider over time, and   therefore a unit of sale is less relevant for us at this point   compared to the past, because we got this much wider sales price   dispersion. So unit of sale per se becomes less relevant. As I   know, you're aware, by the way our top competitors in   smartphones, in tablets, in computers do not provide quarterly   unit sales information either. But of course, we understand that   this is something of interest and when we believe that providing   qualitative commentary on unit sales offers additional relevant   information to investors, we will do so. Tim Cook    --   Chief Executive Officer Let me make one additional point there, just for clarity, is   that, Shannon, our intention is to continue to give revenue   guidance at the company level and gross margin guidance in the   other categories that we've been providing. And so -- our   guidance isn't changing, it's the -- it's the actual report   that's changing. Nancy Paxton    --   Senior Director of Investor Relations Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question   please? Operator The next question comes from Mike Olson with Piper   Jaffray. Michael Olson    --   Piper Jaffray & Co. -- Analyst Thanks very much and good afternoon. With the staggered iPhone   launch were you able to discern any impact on the XS and XS Max   from buyers potentially waiting for the XR, and what if anything   can we take away from the December quarter guidance related to   what you're seeing for early demand of the 10R? And then I have a   follow-up. Thanks. Tim Cook    --   Chief Executive Officer Mike, its Tim. The XS and XS Max got off to a really great   start, and we've only been selling for a few weeks. The XR, we've   only got out there for, I guess five days or so at this point.   And so that it's -- we have very, very little data there. Usually   there is some amount of wait until a product shows -- another   product shows up and look, but -- and looking at the data, on the   sales data for XS and XS Max, there's not obvious evidence of   that in the data as I see it. Michael Olson    --   Piper Jaffray & Co. -- Analyst Got it. And you mentioned record levels for various components   of the services business. As we look forward if growth of   services is to maintain something close to the recent pace, what   are the components of services that you're particularly excited   about, that could drive that and be the strongest drivers. And   maybe an offshoot to that, it seems like the news flow around   augmented reality slowed a little bit in recent months. Is that   potentially a material contributor to services in the near   future? Thanks. Luca Maestri    --   Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mike, as we said, during the September quarter we set new   records for many, many services categories right from Apple Music   to Cloud Services, to the App Store to AppleCare and Apple Pay   really has an exponential trajectory right now.When we look at our services business, we think about the fact   that we had a very large and growing installed base. The   installed base of all our major product categories is at an   all-time high and it's been growing over the last several   quarters. So the opportunity for us to monetize our services   business continues to grow over time. Of course, we are also   improving the quality of the services that we provide, and if you   look back, during the last three years, we've added new services   to our portfolio, we added Apple Pay, we added Apple Music, we   added these advertising business on our AppStore, and clearly we   will want to continue to offer new services over time.So there are a number of vectors that allow us to continue to   grow the business over time. We have stated that, we want to   double the size of the services business from the level that we   had in fiscal '16 by 2020. We are well on pace to achieve that   and we feel very, very confident about the future of -- and the   opportunities that we have in the services space. Tim Cook    --   Chief Executive Officer Mike, in terms of your question on AR, I have a different view   than you do on this one. We, just a year ago -- practically, a   year ago, we came out with a ARKit 1, six months or so after that   we came out with 1.5, we then recently came out with ARKit 2. The   number of things that you can do are growing significantly, the   number of developers that either have done something or even more   the case that are working on things that I've seen are growing   tremendously. There's a lot of interest out there, and the number   of categories that I'm seeing from gaming to shopping to -- I was   in China a few weeks ago and saw AR in the -- in an art sense, an   art exhibit. I was in Berlin last week and saw it being used in a   historical educational kind of sense. I'm seeing it sort of   everywhere I go now. And so, I think we are in the early days and   it will keep getting better and better but I'm really happy with   where things are at the moment. Nancy Paxton    --   Senior Director of Investor Relations Thank you, Mike. Could we have the next question please? Operator Next, we'll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Huberty    --   Morgan Stanley & Co. -- Analyst Thank you, Tim. Given the current trade negotiations and   broader geopolitical risk, do you have any plans to consider   diversifying the supply chain and if you were to do that either   on your own or sort of forced, do you think it would have   significant impact on the business or profitability? Tim Cook    --   Chief Executive Officer Katy, if you look at the products that we have created and are   manufacturing, they're really manufactured everywhere. We have   significant content from the US market, we have content from   Japan, to Korea, to many countries and we have great content from   China as well. And so, there are many hands in the product, the   vast majority or almost all of the R&D is in the United   States as well as a lot of the support organizations and -- so as   I think that basic model where you look around the world and find   the best in different areas, I don't expect that model to go out   of style, so to speak. I think there is a reason why things have   developed in that way and I think it's great for all countries   and citizens of countries that are involved in that. And I'm   still of the mindset that I feel very optimistic and positive,   the discussions that are going will be fruitful. These   relationships, these trade relationships are big and complex and   they clearly do need a level of focus and a level of updating and   modernization and so I'm optimistic of that the countries in the   US and China and the US and Europe and so forth can work these   things out and work for the benefit of everyone. Kathryn Huberty    --   Morgan Stanley & Co. -- Analyst That's helpful color. And Luca, as a follow-up. NAND prices   fell significantly during the September quarter. Why aren't we   seeing that flows through to margin expansion for the overall   company? Luca Maestri    --   Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer You are referring to the guidance that we provided for Q1, I   imagine and -- Kathryn Huberty    --   Morgan Stanley & Co. -- Analyst Yes. Luca Maestri    --   Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Let me give you the puts and takes Katy. You're correct, so we   are going to be getting some benefits from commodities in general   and memory in particular, memory on a sequential basis, it's   about 30 basis points favorable for us, going into the December   quarter, and obviously we're going to be benefiting from the   leverage which is typical of our seasonality in the December   quarter. On the other hand, as I mentioned before, currencies   have weekend against the US dollar and the impact that we expect   at the gross margin level from foreign exchange is 90 basis   points headwind sequentially. And, of course, at this point in   the cycle, we also have higher cost structures, because as I   said, we've launched so many new products in the last six weeks.   So those are the puts and takes, leverage and commodity savings   on one side and FX and the new products on the other side. Nancy Paxton    --   Senior Director of Investor Relations Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please? Operator Next we'll go to Jim Suva with Citigroup. Jim Suva    --   Citigroup -- Analyst Thank you very much. A question for Tim and a question for   Luca and I'll ask them at the same time, so you can decide who   wants to go first or second. But operationally Tim, I think your   company is at a disadvantage relative to others in India, giving   where items are produced versus shipped versus tax versus   installed as well as ability to own stores. So can you help us   address that, is India going to potentially be a big area? I   think you got about only 1% market share, but it sounded like   things maybe softened there.And then for Luca, there will probably be a lot of pushback   about not giving iPhone unit data. It sounds like you're still   going to give revenue data if I heard that correctly. But some   people may fear that this now means that the iPhone units are   going to start going negative year-over-year because it's easy to   talk about great things and not show the details of things that   are so great. So thank you very much, gentlemen. Tim Cook    --   Chief Executive Officer Okay. I'll start with India. We've had really great productive   discussions with the Indian government and I fully expect that,   at some point they will agree to allow us to bring our stores   into the country. We've been in discussions with them and the   discussions are going quite well. There is, as you point out,   there are import duties in summer, most of the product categories   that we are in some cases they compound and this is an area that   we're giving lots of feedback on. We do manufacture some of the   entry iPhones in India and that project has gone well. I am a big   believer in India, I'm very bullish on the country and the people   and our ability to do well there. The currency weakness has been   part of our challenge there as you can tell from just looking at   the currency trends. But I sort of view these as speed bumps   along a very long journey through. And the long-term is -- I   think is very, very strong there. There is a huge number of   people that will move into the middle class. The government has   really focused on reform in a major way and made some very bold   moves and I applaud them for doing that and sort of can't wait   for the future there. Luca Maestri    --   Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer And Jim, let me take the question on units. First of all, as   Tim said, our approach to guidance -- providing guidance doesn't   change at all. And we continue to provide the same metrics that   we're providing before. In terms of reporting results, one of the   things that we're doing and it's new and it's an addition to the   information that we provide to investors because we've heard some   significant level of interest around this is starting with the   December quarter for the first time, we are going to be providing   information on revenue and cost of sales and therefore gross   margins for both products and services. And this will be the   first time that we're going to provide gross margin information   for our Services business which we believe it is an important   metric for our investors to follow.I've given that the rationale and why we do not believe that   providing unit sales is particularly relevant for our company at   this point. I can reassure you that it is our objective to grow   unit sales for every product category that we have. But as I said   earlier, a unit of sale is less relevant today than it was in the   past. To give you an example, the unit sales of iPhone at the top   end of the line have been very strong during the September   quarter. And that's very important because we are attracting   customers to the most recent technologies and features and   innovation, that we bring into the lineup. But you don't   necessarily see that in the number that is reported. And so,   therefore, we will -- as I said, we will provide the qualitative   commentary, when it is important and relevant but at the end of   the day, we make our decisions to -- from a financial standpoint   to try and optimize our revenue and our gross margin dollars and   that we think is -- the focus that is in the best interest of our   investors. Tim Cook    --   Chief Executive Officer Jim, let me just add a couple of things to the -- for color.   Our installed base is growing at double-digit and so there is no   -- and that's probably a much more significant metric for us from   a ecosystem point of view and the customer loyalty et cetera. The   second thing is, this is a little bit like if you go to the   market and you push your cart up to the cashier and she says or   he says, how many units you have in there? It's sort of, it   doesn't matter a lot, how many units that are in there in terms   of the overall value of what's in the cart.

 By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Asian shares jumped on Friday after a phone call between the U.S. and Chinese presidents raised hopes of a thaw in trade tensions, but gains were checked by signs of slowing global  growth and a warning from tech giant Apple Inc on holiday sales. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  touched a two-and-a-half-week high and was last up 1.4 percent, adding to the previous session's strong gains. Chinese blue-chips  gained 1.7 percent, and China's start-up board  added 3 percent after President Xi Jinping promised more support for private firms.  Japan's Nikkei stock index  was 1.2 percent higher. The cheerier mood in Asian trade followed a rise in U.S. shares overnight, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average  and the S&P 500  each gaining 1.06 percent while  the Nasdaq Composite  rallied 1.75 percent. A combination of bargain-hunting following steep losses in equities last month and some strong corporate earnings have helped power Wall Street's bounce. After the bell, though, shares of Apple  tumbled about 7.0 percent after it said sales for the crucial holiday quarter could miss Wall Street expectations due to weakness in emerging markets and foreign exchange costs. Apple suppliers in Asia largely shrugged off the news as investors hoped some progress was being made on trade. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co  gained 1.5 percent, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co  added 0.2 percent. Tech rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  also rallied, rising 2 percent. Global investors lapped up news that the leaders of the world's two largest economies may be ready to take concrete steps to resolve their bitter trade dispute - one of the major factors behind the recent equity market rout. U.S. President Donald Trump said trade discussions with China were "moving along nicely" and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping expressed hopes of expanding trade cooperation. Trump said he planned to meet with Xi at an upcoming G-20 summit  Earlier this week, Trump had been quoted as saying China was not ready to make a deal yet and he would impose more tariffs on Chinese goods unless he and Xi had productive talks. "While we are still cautious over a full resolution of recent tensions in the medium term, resumption of dialogue between Washington and Beijing would be good enough to investors for now. Hence the next four weeks between the U.S. mid-term elections and the G20 meeting in Argentina on Nov 30 will be important to see how things progress," said Tai Hui, chief market strategist, Asia Pacific, at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. "Combined with the prospects of more economic stimulus from China and reasonable valuations in Asian equities, investors could use this opportunity to reload on emerging market and Asia assets," he said. All the same, a U.S. Justice Department indictment said companies based in mainland China and Taiwan had conspired to steal trade secrets for a U.S. semiconductor firm, underscoring Sino-U.S. trade tensions.  
 IN THE (DATA) DUMPS Investors will be looking ahead to a U.S. jobs report, due at 1230 GMT, for more indications on the health of the U.S. economy and the clues on the pace of further interest rate rises. U.S. nonfarm payroll figures are expected to rise 190,000 in October from 134,000 a month earlier, with average hourly earnings seen increasing 0.2 percent in October after a 0.3 percent gain the previous month. Those numbers follow data this week revealing slower factory growth around the world, adding to worries about the outlook for corporate earnings, business investment and trade. Data from the U.S. showed cooling manufacturing activity in October as a measure of new orders hit a 1-1/2 year low. That came after manufacturing surveys showed factory activity and export orders weakening across Asia as the impact of the trade war deepened.  In currency markets, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was up 0.1 percent at 96.367 after a sharp drop on Thursday. The dollar had fallen across the board as the pound rallied on reports that London is close to sealing a financial services deal with Brussels, and after the Bank of England hinted at slightly rate rises in future.  "A corrective setup is in place for the USD, with overbought valuations and a series of reversals across various currency pairs arguing for a short-term pullback," RBC Capital Markets analysts said in a note. The pound  fell 0.16 percent to $1.2988. The weaker dollar also boosted the offshore yuan  after it touched 6.9800 per dollar on Thursday, its weakest level since January 2017. By 0306 GMT Friday the currency was changing hands at 6.9300. The onshore yuan  was 0.14 percent weaker at 6.9295. The dollar inched up against the yen to 112.72, and the euro  was down 0.11 percent on the day at $1.1394. U.S. crude  dipped 0.6 percent to $63.31 a barrel. Brent crude  was 0.5 percent lower at $72.51. Spot gold  eased 0.08 percent to $1,232.81 per ounce.

"Trade issues are not something the U.S. and China can solvein a short-term. The market has accepted that it will take along-time to solve," said Toru Ibayashi, executive director ofWealth Management at UBS Securities Japan. With the first-half earnings season in focus, Ibayashi saidthat the market's concern is how cautious Japanese companieswill be with their earnings forecasts amid worries about theimpact from the trade war.

Apple (AAPL) Beats but Sells Off; Plus SBUX, CBS & More
 The much-awaited Apple Inc. AAPL   fiscal Q4 earnings results have hit the tape a half hour after the end of regular-day trading, with headline beats for both earnings and sales: $2.91 per share was both above the $2.79 expected and 40% higher than the year-ago quarter, and revenues of $62.9 billion topped the $61.5 billion Zacks consensus estimate. However, shares are selling off 3.7% in late trading as analyst peek under the hood:   Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside? Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.  See the pot trades we're targeting>>    
Apple (AAPL) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.91 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.79 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.07 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.30%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $2.17 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.34, delivering a surprise of 7.83%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Apple, which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, posted revenues of $62.90 billion for the quarter ended September 2018, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.29%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $52.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Apple shares have added about 29.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 1.4%.What's Next for Apple?While Apple has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $4.79 on $91.32 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $13.52 on $279.34 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Mini computers is currently in the top 42% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

5 Top Stock Trades for Friday: AAPL, BABA and Fitbit Earnings
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMore bullish follow through on Thursday is giving investors some confidence, as key stock market leaders continue to burst higher. The key now? What will Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock do when it reports earnings? Not surprisingly, it's the first name on our list of top stock trades.Shares of Apple are roughly flat as the company's fourth-quarter results are due up about 30 minutes after the stock market's close. Investors will watch to see which way this $1 trillion market cap stock leans, likely dragging the rest of the market with it.For Apple and stock trading in general, let's keep it simple. Right now the market is factoring in an $11.30 move in either direction. Above and that puts us near the $230 highs. Below and that puts us near $208.If support near $205 holds up, investors have a limited risk/reward buy. Over channel resistance (blue line), as well as the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, Apple has a shot at taking out the $230 highs and rallying to its all-time high near $233.What a sight for a sore eyes this rally in NXP Semi (NASDAQ: NXPI ) is. Shares are up 13% after the company reported earnings and provided in-line guidance. The stock is cheap and has solid growth forecasts for 2019, but is getting no love at the moment.Part that's due to the beating in the semiconductor group, the other comes after the acquisition of NXP by Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) failed to gain approval. If you recall, QCOM had to revise its bid higher to $127.50 a share because its initial deal price didn't value NXP high enough.Now shares are at $85 and recently hit a low of $70. Oh yeah, did I mention it trades at sub-10 times forward earnings?It doesn't matter. On the charts, we have trouble. While shares have cleared downtrend resistance, they are running full steam into the 50-day moving average - and halting. I don't love that action, especially as the 50-day has been resistance in the past.Some follow through and/or consolidation near current levels would be a next great step for the stock. I'd expect $90 to give NXP some trouble and while not all that related, Apple's impact on tech over the next few days may be the deciding factor for NXP. I'd be cautious on NXP below $82.50 and even more so below Thursday's lows. At the very least, it needs to stay above its 20-day moving average.What a power move by Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ), which is rallying nearly 30% post-earnings and into its vital holiday season . With momentum back, I think we can see a move up to the $6.80 to $7 range. Above and we get the recent highs of $7.75 on the table.Will it happen? Gapping above all three major moving averages and downtrend resistance certainly makes the chart look much healthier. They key will be holding onto these gains and squeezing higher from here.Unfortunately, it's too volatile of a name for me to take a position in and with Apple's earnings on deck - it has the Apple Watch, don't forget - I'm leery of Fitbit. Plus, the risk/reward is tough to justify right here. I just can't find a reasonable stop-loss point, not from Thursday's level anyway. That leaves too much potential risk on the table for me, and regardless of the potential reward, that's what's matters most.Let's see how it settles out over the next few days. Good jobs, bulls.A nice rally over the past few days has elevated Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) off its lows. For shorts though, it's giving them an opportune risk/reward.A close above downtrend resistance, the 50-day and 100-day moving average can act as the stop-loss. Should they hold as resistance though, Goldman looks like it's heading lower, at least temporarily. A close above this mark can get investors in on the long side, as they look for a rally up to the 200-day.Positive comments from President Trump regarding Chinese-U.S. trade relations sparked a rally in Chinese equities - even if they have nothing to do with trade. Stocks like Huya (NASDAQ: HUYA ), Sogou (NYSE: SOGO ), iQiyi (NASDAQ: IQ ) and others all surged. So too did Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) and JD.com (NASDAQ: JD ). As for the latter, we've mapped out the perfect buy zone on this stock at least a dozen times here on InvestorPlace, which called for a buy at $22 to $23 . So what do we do with Alibaba then?Alibaba is trickier and even though shares up more than 5% so far today, we will need more follow through to repair these charts. Remember, this thing was beaten badly. It will take more than a day to fix it.Shares are rallying into downtrend resistance and short-term resistance near $150. I would love to see another strong day and for BABA to get up over the 50-day. If anything though, getting above and staying above $150 would be a great first start. From there, we can target the key $165 to $170 area, but this would be an important first step. Keep in mind, Alibaba reports earnings on Friday before the open and we're less than two weeks away from Singles' Day.All that said, I wouldn't chase BABA up 20 points from where it traded a few days ago. Let's see the earnings and go from there.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell . As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long AAPL and NXPI. The post 5 Top Stock Trades for Friday: AAPL, BABA and Fitbit Earnings appeared first on InvestorPlace .
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDespite the positive news from Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ), the company's cash flow problems, and the resulting drag on TSLA stock, will not go away anytime soon. But TSLA has a strong brand which it can leverage for the next few quarters. Moreover, TSLA has already shown great product development capabilities compared to other auto companies that have more resources.Using those two strengths, Tesla can start selling electronics products, enabling it to build a strong cash flow machine that can fund its ambitions in the electric vehicle (EV) and solar segments.Currently, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is the only U.S. company among the world's top five smartphone manufacturers. Overseas smartphone makers  Huawei , Xiaomi and Oppo have faced regulatory hurdles in launching their products in the U.S market. Tesla can take advantage of this situation by entering the electronics segment, enabling it to build a business with strong cash flow and huge margins. Such an initiative would also help the company build a better ecosystem for its cars.Solving Tesla's Cash Flow ProblemAs TSLA ramps up production of its Model 3, it has proved most of the naysayers completely wrong. A huge amount of attention is devoted to the actual production levels of the company's Model 3 cars every month. It would be better to focus on long-term production trends and let the company's management iron out any production issues.But it is quite obvious that Tesla's biggest hurdle is actually its cash burn rate. Bloomberg has built a nice tool which shows Tesla's cash burn rate.It is possible that TSLA will need to raise more money if its cash burn continues at its present rate. A recent report by Goldman Sachs estimated that Tesla would require a whopping $10 billion by 2020 to fund the launch of new models, bankroll its expansion in China and make its cars. That is a staggering number. but Musk has said that it would be able to continue its operations without additional funding.However, even if Model 3 production accelerates meaningfully and the company successfully launches new models, the company's cash flow problem will not be solved. So TSLA immediately needs to enter asegment within its core competence which can provide it with sufficient margins.TSLA has a huge brand presence with a strong fan following. As a result, it has been able to maintain its customer base and its Model 3 deposits while it solved the production issues. Earlier this year, Musk was able to sell 20,000 flamethrowers for $500 apiece, generating $10 million, of revenue within a few days and without any marketing.Tesla has built a strong brand, but it needs to provide customers with the ability to buy the brand at a much lower price point. A college graduate might not have enough money to buy a Tesla car, but he would still like to experience the Tesla brand. The ideal option is to sell smartphones or other electronic products which cost less than $1,000 and still provide the company with sizable margins and free cash flow.The Total Addressable MarketAAPL sold 216 million iPhones in its last fiscal year. These smartphones generate close to two-thirds of its total revenue and possibly a higher percentage of its net income. Apple's annual free cash flow has been relatively stable at $50 billion for some time. If TSLA was to start competing with AAPL, it would ideally target the premium category within smartphones and wearables, in order to protect and enhance its brand image.A significant percentage of Tesla's customers has supported it because of its mission of bringing clean energy into the mainstream. Any customer who buys a $1,000 Tesla phone can be assured that any profits that the company makes on the product would directly fund the development of better EV vehicles and platforms. That is a much more appealing use of profits than using them to fund the buybacks of billions of dollars of stock, as AAPL is doing every quarter.Can Tesla Build a Profitable Electronics Segment?An entrance by TSLA into the electronics segment would carry less risk than other initiatives it has undertaken, while allowing the company to leverage some of its core strengths.Tesla has shown that it can sell tens of thousands of cars annually without spending any money on any advertising. Its product development has also been superior to other, much larger companies. Another one of the advantages of the strategy I've proposed is that TSLA can easily outsource the manufacturing of smartphones and other electronics. Tesla's manufacturing abilities have not been great, to put it mildly. Finally, TSLA wouldn't need to invest that much in R&D to launch and sell its own line of electronic products.One of the smartphone manufacturers which has recently gone public is Xiaomi. It currently commands a market cap of close to $50 billion. It spent 3.2 billion yuan  or roughly $500 million on R&D in 2017. Last year it shipped 91 million smartphones.Tesla is already increasing the amount of electronics within its cars. A recent teardown by Munro & Associates shows that TSLA will be able to increase its margins by integrating more electronics within its cars. By entering the smartphone segment, TSLA can not only add millions of new customers but also expand its own electronic ecosystem.Overall, it looks like Tesla can afford to take this step. However, the company's management is already busy with a whole host of difficult problems which include ramping up Model 3 production, running the company's solar business and bringing new models to the market. Any additional business segments will reduce the amount of time that management can spend on dealing with car production issues. Ideally, once TSLA starts producing 10,000 Model 3 vehicles per week, the operation  should become much smoother, enabling the company's management to oversee other businesses.Tesla's ability to leverage its brand image to build new profitable segments is not reflected in the current price of TSLA stock.The Bottom Line on TSLATesla desperately needs to build a new segment which can meaningfully boost its free cash flow, helping to support its auto production. The ideal choice for this new segment would be electronics in general and premium smartphones in particular, since they have high margins. Tesla has a great brand and tremendous product development capabilities. As a result, it can bring new, innovative electronic devices to the market.As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post How Tesla Can Solve Its Cash Flow Problems And Boost TSLA Stock appeared first on InvestorPlace .
 By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Nov 1 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose for a third straight session on Thursday as President Donald Trump said trade talks with China were "moving along nicely," reviving hopes that the two countries can resolve their trade dispute. Adding to the upbeat mood, the latest round of results from companies was mostly positive. U.S. stock futures fell late Thursday. S&P 500 e-mini futures  were down 0.4 percent in trading for the overnight session. During the regular session, the technology index  rose 1.2 percent, continuing to recover from the recent selloff. Earlier, Trump said he plans to meet with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit in Argentina at the end of the month. The trade-sensitive S&P industrial sector  rose 1.7 percent, with Boeing Co  and Caterpillar Inc  among companies leading the gains. "Maybe there's going to be some hope that a trade deal with China will actually come through," said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. Beyond that, investors are feeling a bit more comfortable after gains this week, he said. "Now you get a little bit of fear of missing out, mixing in with, 'I don't believe this is actually happening'," he said. "The fear of missing out seems to be on the winning side." Despite ending higher on Wednesday, the S&P 500 closed out its worst month in seven years, following fears of a widening global trade dispute, rising borrowing costs, and that U.S. earnings growth may slow more than forecast in 2019. The S&P materials index  was up 3.0 percent, with DowDuPont Inc  surging 8.1 percent after it reported strong results and plans for a $3 billion share buyback.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 264.98 points, or 1.06 percent, to 25,380.74, the S&P 500  gained 28.63 points, or 1.06 percent, to 2,740.37 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 128.16 points, or 1.75 percent, to 7,434.06. Also helping were robust earnings reports from three Apple suppliers, NXP Semiconductors, Dialog Semiconductor  and Qorvo Inc. Technology-related stocks, which have led the stock market's bull run in recent years, helped lead the selling in October, with the S&P 500 tech index down 8 percent in the month. The Nasdaq is up 5.4 percent for the last three sessions, its biggest three-day gain since February 2016. Of the 348 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported results so far, 77 percent have reported earnings above analysts' expectations, pushing the aggregate third-quarter earnings growth estimate for S&P 500 companies to 26.2 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Friday brings the U.S. monthly jobs report for October. Investors will look for further signs of tightening labor market conditions.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.46-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 32 new highs and 57 new lows. About 9.1 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 8.7 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days.

 By Stephen Nellis Nov 1 (Reuters) - Apple Inc  on Thursday warned that sales for the crucial holiday quarter would likely miss Wall Street expectations, which Chief Executive Tim Cook blamed on weakness in emerging markets and foreign exchange costs. The disappointing forecast by the world's most valuable technology company helped send shares down as much as 7 percent, taking roughly $70 billion off Apple's market value and forcing that value below $1 trillion. The forecast could also deepen concerns for technology companies that saw a sell-off after misses by Amazon.com Inc  and Google parent Alphabet Inc. Cook in an interview with Reuters said that Apple is "seeing some macroeconomic weakness in some of the emerging markets." He later told investors on a conference call that weak markets included Brazil, India, Russia and Turkey. Sales were flat in the fourth quarter in India, Cook said. "Obviously, we would like to see that be a huge growth," Cook said on the call. Executives said they also would quit giving the number of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers, leading to a further drop in the share price, since iPhone unit sales was long the key indicator of quarterly success.  Withholding that number will make it impossible to calculate the average selling price of phones, another key measure. Apple executives said unit sales are becoming less relevant as customers buy bundled products that include subscription services like Apple Music. Apple said it would start giving cost-of-sales data for its services business, an important metric for subscription businesses. But investors reacted negatively. "Companies typically stop reporting metrics when the metrics are about to turn. This is not a good look for Apple," said analyst Walter Piecyk from BTIG Research. Apple sold 46.9 million iPhones in the fiscal fourth quarter, missing analyst expectations of 47.5 million iPhones, according to FactSet. But the average selling price of iPhones was $793, well above analyst estimates of $750.78, according to FactSet. "Our worry is there must be a limit to Apple's pricing power," said George Salmon, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. "The group is now charging close to $800 per phone, and while that's helping revenues climb despite flat sales volumes, one has to wonder how the strategy to shimmy up the price ladder fares in a downturn. If consumers start feeling the pinch, those price tags could put the punters off." In an interview with Reuters, Cook said his caution on holiday sales was in part due to Apple's earlier-than-normal launch of its top-end iPhone models, the XS and XS Max. Cook also said foreign exchange rates would have a $2 billion negative impact on Apple's sales forecast. Apple was unsure whether it can make enough new iPhones, Apple Watches, iPads and Mac models it released in recent weeks, Cook told Reuters. Apple is widely expanding the use of its facial recognition unlocking system in iPhones and iPads, which uses special lasers that are produced by only a handful of suppliers. Elazar Advisors analyst Chaim Siegel said that China trade issues could be making it difficult for Apple to get the supplies it needs. "As for emerging markets slowing, that's also contagion from China. Both trade war issues coming to reality," he said. But Cook stressed that Apple was happy with its performance in China, where revenue grew 16 percent to $11.4 billion, the fifth quarter in a row the company has had double-digit growth in the region. Apple's cautious forecast could accelerate investor fears that have in turn erased stock market gains for much of the year. At market close on Thursday, Apple shares had been up more than 25 percent for the year - supported by purchases by Warren Buffett and a $100 billion share buy-back program - while the Nasdaq Composite Index is nearly flat for the year. Apple said revenue from services, which includes iCloud, the App Store and Apple Music, reached $10 billion, in line with analyst estimates. Apple investors have been increasingly focused on growth in the company's services business as consumer markets become saturated with smartphones. Apple forecast a tax rate of 16.5 percent for the December quarter, above analyst expectations of 15.9 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. For its full fiscal 2018 ended in September, Apple reported revenue of $265.6 billion and profits of $11.91 per share, beating analyst estimates of $264 billion and $11.79 per share.

Initial Jobless Claims last week were down to 214k, well within the historically robust range we have seen recently, while Labor Costs data showed that wages were ticking higher amid tight employment conditions.However, at least a few trendy stocks were down in morning trading after disappointing earnings announcements. Notably, Spotify SPOT  posted modest subscriber growth and narrowed its expectations for full-year monthly listeners slightly, sending its shares sharply lower.

Dave has confidence that a strong economy will inspire a great holiday quarter for Apple, but he did suggest that investors using Apple as a lynchpin for the broader market does present some risk here.Dave also explains why investors should keep a close eye on the upcoming jobs report. The risk with these numbers, according to Dave, is that wage-based inflation will force the Fed to grow even more hawkish. This would create more short-term volatility for stocks, as we saw this month. However, as Dave explains, higher wages should be a long-term buoy for stocks.Finally, Dave concludes by giving investors a strategy for navigating a market rebound.

 By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Nov 1 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose for a third straight session on Thursday as President Donald Trump said trade talks with China were "moving along nicely," reviving hopes that the two countries can resolve their trade dispute. Adding to the upbeat mood, the latest round of results from companies was mostly positive. The trade-sensitive S&P industrial sector  rose 1.7 percent, with Boeing Co  and Caterpillar Inc  among companies leading the gains. "Maybe there's going to be some hope that a trade deal with China will actually come through," said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. Beyond that, investors are feeling a bit more comfortable after gains this week, he said. "Now you get a little bit of fear of missing out, mixing in with, 'I don't believe this is actually happening'," he said. "The fear of missing out seems to be on the winning side." Despite ending higher on Wednesday, the S&P 500 closed out its worst month in seven years, following fears of a widening global trade dispute, rising borrowing costs, and that U.S. earnings growth may slow more than forecast in 2019. The S&P materials index  was up 3.0 percent, with DowDuPont Inc  surging 8.1 percent after it reported strong results and plans for a $3 billion share buyback.  Share of Apple Inc, which rose in regular trading, were down about 4 percent after the bell in volatile trading following the release of its results.  During the regular session, the technology index  rose 1.2 percent, continuing to recover from the recent selloff. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 264.98 points, or 1.06 percent, to 25,380.74, the S&P 500  gained 28.63 points, or 1.06 percent, to 2,740.37 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 128.16 points, or 1.75 percent, to 7,434.06. Also helping were robust earnings reports from three Apple suppliers, NXP Semiconductors, Dialog Semiconductor  and Qorvo Inc. Technology-related stocks, which have led the stock market's bull run in recent years, helped lead the selling in October, with the S&P 500 tech index down 8 percent in the month. The Nasdaq is up 5.4 percent for the last three sessions, its biggest three-day gain since February 2016. Of the 348 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported results so far, 77 percent have reported earnings above analysts' expectations, pushing the aggregate third-quarter earnings growth estimate for S&P 500 companies to 26.2 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Friday brings the U.S. monthly jobs report for October. Investors will look for further signs of tightening labor market conditions.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.46-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 32 new highs and 57 new lows. About 9.1 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 8.7 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days.

Apple Profit, Revenues Top Wall Street View, Outlook Disappoints; Shares Down 4%
  (RTTNews.com) - Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) Thursday reported an earnings and revenues for the fourth quarter that trumped Wall Street estimates, helped by strong demand for its pricier iPhone X and XS. However, shares slipped over 4 percent in extended session after the iPhone maker issued a weak revenue outlook for the holiday season quarter. Apple sold 46.89 million iPhone units during quarter, generating $37.19 billion in revenues, compared with 46.68 million units and $28.85 billion in revenues last year. Analysts' expected iPhone sales of 47.5 million handsets. Although, iPhone units sales for the quarter were relatively flat, iPhone revenues jumped a sharp 29 percent largely helped by premium iPhone X and XS, which carry a significant price premium over the iPhone 8 and previous models. "We're thrilled to report another record-breaking quarter that caps a tremendous fiscal 2018, the year in which we shipped our 2 billionth iOS device, celebrated the 10th anniversary of the App Store and achieved the strongest revenue and earnings in Apple's history," said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. "Over the past two months, we've delivered huge advancements for our customers through new versions of iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad and Mac as well as our four operating systems, and we enter the holiday season with our strongest lineup of products and services ever." Apple's bottom line continues to be buoyed by iPhone sales, as it contributes about two-thirds of Apple's revenues and a major part of its profit. "We concluded a record year with our best September quarter ever, growing double digits in every geographic segment. We set September quarter revenue records for iPhone and Wearables and all-time quarterly records for Services and Mac," said CFO Luca Maestri. Meanwhile, Apple's services business, which includes digital content and other services, revenues reached an all-time high of $10 billion. Apple reported fourth-quarter profit of $14.12 billion or $2.91 per share, up from $10.71 billion or $2.07 per share last year. On average, 34 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected earnings of $2.78 per share for the quarter. Apple said its revenues climbed 20 percent to $62.90 billion from last year's $52.58 billion. Analysts had a consensus revenues prediction of $61.57 billion. Looking forward to the first quarter, Apple expects revenue between $89 billion and $93 billion. Analysts currently project revenues of $92.91 billion. Apple also declared a cash dividend of $0.73 per share, payable on November 15 to shareholders of record on November 12. AAPL closed Thursday's trading at $222.22, up $3.36 or 1.54% on the Nasdaq. The stock, however, slipped $9.22 or 4.15% in the after-hours trade.

 By Stephen Nellis Nov 1 (Reuters) - Apple Inc  on Thursday warned that sales for the crucial holiday quarter would likely miss Wall Street expectations, which Chief Executive Tim Cook blamed on weakness in emerging markets, foreign exchange costs and uncertainty whether the iPhone maker can keep up with demand for new products. The weak forecast by the world's most valuable technology company sent shares down as much as 4.3 percent to $212.46 in after-hours trading, taking roughly $40 billion off Apple's market value of more than $1 trillion at market close Thursday. Apple said it expects between $89 billion and $93 billion in revenue for its fiscal first quarter ending in December, with a midpoint of $91 billion coming in below Wall Street expectations of $93 billion, according Refinitiv data. In an interview with Reuters, Cook said some of the forecast was explained by Apple releasing its top-end iPhone models, the XS and XS Max, in the fiscal fourth quarter. Cook also said foreign exchange rates would have a $2 billion negative impact on Apple's sales forecast. Apple was unsure whether it can make enough new iPhones, Apple Watches, iPads and Mac models it released in recent weeks, Cook told Reuters. Apple is widely expanding the use of its facial recognition unlocking system in iPhones and iPads, which uses special lasers that are still produced by only a handful of suppliers. Cook said that Apple is "seeing some macroeconomic weakness in some of the emerging markets," without specifying which ones. But Cook stressed that Apple was happy with its performance in China, where revenue grew 16 percent to $11.4 billion, the fifth quarter in a row the company has had double-digit growth in the region. Apple's cautious forecast could accelerate investor fears that have in turn erased stock market gains for much of the year. At market close on Thursday, Apple shares were up more than 25 percent for the year - supported by purchases by Warren Buffett and a $100 billion share buy-back program - while the Nasdaq Composite Index is nearly flat for the year. "I think they've always been fairly conservative with the guidance they've given out," said Trip Miller, managing partner at Apple shareholder Gullane Capital Partners. "I hope that's the case here." Apple sold 46.9 million iPhones in the fiscal fourth quarter, missing analyst expectations of 47.5 million iPhones, according to FactSet. But the average selling price of iPhones was $793, well above analyst estimates of $750.78, according to FactSet. Apple said revenue from services, which includes iCloud, the App Store and Apple Music, reached $10 billion, in line with analyst estimates. Apple investors have been increasingly focused on growth in the company's services business as growth in the global market for smartphones levels off in terms of unit sales. Apple forecast a tax rate of 16.5 percent for the December quarter, above analyst expectations of 15.9 percent, according to data from Refinitiv. "There's going to be a minimum tax on foreign earnings coming from the new tax legislation" passed in the United States, Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters. For its full fiscal 2018 ended in September, Apple reported revenue of $265.6 billion and profits of $11.91 per share, beating analyst estimates of $264 billion and $11.79 per share.

Despite ending higher on Wednesday, the S&P 500 closed out its worst month in seven years, following fears of a widening global trade dispute, rising borrowing costs, and that U.S. earnings growth may slow more than forecast in 2019. The S&P materials index  was up 3.0 percent, with DowDuPont Inc  surging after it reported strong results and plans for a $3 billion share buyback.  Apple Inc  was up slightly ahead of its results, due after the bell. The technology index  rose 1.2 percent, continuing to recover from the recent selloff. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 264.98 points, or 1.06 percent, to 25,380.74, the S&P 500  gained 28.63 points, or 1.06 percent, to 2,740.37 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 128.16 points, or 1.75 percent, to 7,434.06. Also helping were robust earnings reports from three Apple suppliers, NXP Semiconductors, Dialog Semiconductor  and Qorvo Inc. Technology-related stocks, which have led the stock market's bull run in recent years, helped lead the selling in October, with the S&P 500 tech index down 8 percent in the month. The Nasdaq is up 5.4 percent for the last three sessions, its biggest three-day gain since February 2016. Of the 348 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported results so far, 77 percent have reported earnings above analysts' expectations, pushing the aggregate third-quarter earnings growth estimate for S&P 500 companies to 26.2 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.46-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 32 new highs and 57 new lows. About 9.1 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 8.7 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days.

Stocks Move Sharply Higher On Optimism About Trade Talks - U.S. Commentary
  (RTTNews.com) - After initially showing a lack of direction, stocks moved sharply higher over the course of the trading session on Thursday. With the gains on the day, the major averages extended the strong upward move seen over the two previous sessions. The major averages ended the day just off their highs of the session. The Dow surged up 264.98 points or 1.1 percent to 25,380.74, the Nasdaq soared 128.16 points or 1.8 percent to 7,434.06 and the S&P 500 jumped 28.63 points or 1.1 percent to 2,740.37. The continued strength on Wall Street came after President Donald Trump said he had a "very good" conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping about trade. "Just had a long and very good conversation with President Xi Jinping of China. We talked about many subjects, with a heavy emphasis on Trade," Trump said in a post on Twitter. "Those discussions are moving along nicely with meetings being scheduled at the G-20 in Argentina," he added. "Also had good discussion on North Korea!" The tweet from Trump comes following recent reports the U.S. will impose tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports if the talks on the sidelines of the G20 summit fail to ease the trade war. On the U.S. economic front, the Labor Department released a report showing a slight drop in first-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits in the week ended October 27th. The report said initial jobless claims edged down to 214,000, a decrease of 2,000 from the previous week's revised level of 216,000. Economists had expected jobless claims to come in unchanged compared to the 215,000 originally reported for the previous week. A separate report from the Labor Department showed a slowdown in the pace of labor productivity growth in the third quarter. The Labor Department said labor productivity climbed by 2.2 percent in the third quarter after jumping by 3.0 percent in the second quarter. Economists had expected productivity to increase by about 2.0 percent. Meanwhile, the report said unit labor costs surged up by 1.2 percent in the third quarter after slumping by 1.0 percent in the second quarter. The rebound in labor costs matched economist estimates. The Institute for Supply Management also released a report showing a bigger than expected slowdown in the pace of growth in manufacturing activity in the month of October. The ISM said its purchasing managers index dropped to 57.7 in October from 59.8 in September, although a reading above 50 still indicates growth in the manufacturing sector. Economists had expected the index to edge down to 59.0. With the much bigger than expected decrease, the manufacturing index fell to its lowest level since hitting 57.3 in April. Sector News Biotechnology stocks moved sharply higher over the course of the trading session, driving the NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index up by 5 percent. Celgene (CELG), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), and Biogen (BIIB) turned in some of the biotech sector's best performances on the day. Substantial strength was also visible among gold stocks, as reflected by the 4.8 percent spike by the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index. The rally among gold stocks came amid a sharp increase by the price of the precious metal, with gold for December delivery soaring $23.60 to $1,238.60 an ounce. Semiconductor stocks also saw significant, resulting in a 4.6 percent jump by the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. The index continued to recover after ending Monday's trading at its lowest closing level in well over a year. Computer hardware, chemical, housing, and retail stocks also moved notably higher, reflecting broad based buying interest on Wall Street. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Thursday. Japan'sNikkei 225 Index slumped by 1.1 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index spiked by 1.8 percent. The major European markets also ended the day mixed. While the German DAX Index rose by 0.2 percent, the French CAC 40 Index and the U.K.'sFTSE 100 Index both dipped by 0.2 percent. In the bond market, treasuries regained ground after moving notably lower over the past few sessions. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, edged down by 1.5 basis points at 3.144 percent. Looking Ahead The Labor Department's closely watched monthly employment report is likely to be in the spotlight on Friday, overshadowing separate reports on the U.S. trade deficit and factory orders. Employment is expected to climb by 190,000 jobs in October after rising by 134,000 jobs in September, while the unemployment rate is expected to hold at 3.7 percent. On the earnings front, tech giant Apple ( AAPL ) is among the companies releasing their quarterly results after the close of today's trading along with CBS Corp. (CBS), GoPro (GPRO), MetLife (MET), and Starbucks (SBUX). Energy giants Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) are also among the companies due to report their quarterly results before the start of trading on Friday.

 Wall Street witnessed wild swings in October fueled by a myriad of woes, ranging from rising interest rates, Italy's political turbulence, and Saudi tensions to tech sell-offs, escalating U.S.-China trade war and mid-term election.  However, the stocks rebounded from the lowest level to close the month. Nasdaq tumbled 9.2%, its biggest monthly drop since November 2008 while the S&P 500 shed 6.9%, its biggest one-month slide since September 2011. The Dow Jones lost 5.1%, its biggest monthly fall since January 2016. A slew of strong earnings releases as well as rounds of upbeat economic data helped to revitalize investors' sentiment somewhat.    That said, a few sectors easily survived the market rout and traded in the green last month. Below we have highlighted such three sectors and their best ETFs & stocks that have gained handsomely in October and could be better plays in the months ahead should the trends prevail.   Gold Mining    Gold generally acts as a store of value and hedge against market turmoil. Acting as a leveraged play on the underlying metal prices, metal miners tend to experience more gains than their bullion cousins in a rising metal market. Hence, mining stocks and ETFs outperformed last month.   Market Vectors Gold Mining ETF GDX  :  This is the most-popular and actively traded gold miner ETF with AUM of $9.2 billion and average daily volume of around 40.7 million shares. The fund follows the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, holding 48 stocks in its basket. Canadian firms account for half of the portfolio, while the United States (16.5%) and Australia (15.9%) round off the top three. The fund charges 53 bps in annual fees and gained 2.2% last month (read: Gold Mining ETFs Slide on Dull Earnings  ).   Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited HMY  :  This is a mining company which produces gold from its operations in the district of Virginia, Orange Free State. The stock saw positive earnings estimate revision of seven cents over the past month for this year and has estimated growth of 130.8%. It has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of C. The stock gained about 17.6% in October.   Utilities    The utilities sector is making the most of all the uncertainty that's looming around. Being the low-beta sector, utility is relatively protected from large swings (ups and downs) in the stock market and is thus considered a defensive investment or safe haven amid economic or political turmoil (read: 5 ETF Areas That Didn't Trick Investors in October  ).   Utilities Select Sector SPDR XLU  :  With AUM of $7.6 billion, this fund provides exposure to a small basket of 29 securities by tracking the Utilities Select Sector Index. It is heavily concentrated on the top firm while other firms hold no more than 8.3% share. Electric utilities take the top spot in terms of sectors at 62.6%, closely followed by multi utilities (32.2%). The product charges 13 bps in annual fees and sees a heavy volume of around 16.2 million shares on average. XLU gained 2% in October and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook.   Polar Power Inc. POLA  :  This is engaged in designing, manufacturing and selling direct current power, systems and cooling systems for telecommunications, military, hybrid power station, DC marine and rapid charging electric vehicle. The stock saw no earnings estimate revision for this year in the past month and its earnings are expected to grow 187.5%. It has a Zacks Rank #3 and VGM Score of B. It was up 6.5% last month.   Consumer Staples    The consumer staples sector is also viewed as defensive as it includes a variety of items like food & beverages, non-durable household goods, hypermarkets and consumer supercenters that are essential for daily needs. These products see steady demand even during an economic downturn due to their low level of correlation with economic cycles. As such, these generally act as a safe haven amid political and economic turmoil. Stocks in these sectors generally outperform during periods of low growth and high uncertainty (read: Shrug Off Rate Fears, Consumer Staples ETFs Are on a Tear  ).   Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund XLP  :  This is the most-popular consumer staples ETF with AUM of $9.1 billion and follows the Consumer Staples Select Sector Index. The fund charges 13 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in heavy volume of nearly 14.5 million shares a day. In total, the fund holds about 32 securities in its basket with heavy concentration on the top three firms. From a sector look, beverages takes the largest share at 25%, while food and staples retailing, household products, and food products round off the top four. XLP was up 2% last month and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a Medium risk outlook.   The Boston Beer Company Inc. SAM  :  This is America's leading brewer of world-class beer. The company witnessed solid earnings estimate revision of 39 cents in the past month and its earnings are expected to grow 24.46% this year. The stock has gained 14.6% in October. It carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has a VGM Score of B.   Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

  Apple AAPL  is looking to boost holiday season sales with the recent launch of iPad Pro. The latest device is equipped with new features including Face ID and TrueDepth camera.        Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM)    |      Apple Inc. Quote   Can New Features Boost Device Sales?      Apple looks to boost iPad sales and engagement levels by   introducing features that "help deliver immersive augmented   reality, provides unmatched portability and ease of use."        Apple used to be a dominant player in the EdTech industry on the   back of its iPad and Mac computer offerings. However, with the   introduction of Alphabet's   GOOGL    lower-priced Chromebook, Apple as well as Microsoft   MSFT    began to lose market share.        This led to a decline in both iPad unit sales and revenues. In   the last reported quarter Apple sold 11.55 million iPads, down 5%   year over year. Revenues (8.9% of sales) of $4.74 billion   decreased 5% year over year.        Apple is also facing tough competition in the smartphone market.   The company lost its spot to Huawei, which became the second   largest smartphone seller in terms of shipment, per latest data   from research firm Gartner. South Korean handset maker Samsung   SSNLF    retained its top ranking in second-quarter 2018.        To regain its market share and survive intensifying competition,   Apple is launching devices with new features and technology,   which is expected to catch user attention. Expanding product   portfolio base that now comprises iPhone XR, iPhone XS, iPhone XS   MaxApple Watch Series 4and new iPads is expected to boost Apple's   sales in the holiday season.        Moreover, iPhone sales, which continue to benefit from higher   average selling price (ASP) and loyal customer base, may also see   momentum with the release of the latest low priced iPhone XR.        Apple currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see    the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)     stocks here.    Wall Street's Next Amazon      Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just   begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all   time.

 U.S. stocks notched their second consecutive day of gains on Wednesday, fueling optimism that investors had found a bottom to the recent bout of selling. October was certainly a month that Wall Street will want to forget, but with some external headwinds cooling down, traders are once again meeting the positives-such as strong earnings results-with bullishness.It has been another busy week for earnings announcements, with several key companies posting impressive numbers at just the right time. Notably, Facebook FB  managed to relieve fears about its future, while General Motors GM  tallied sturdy sales of SUVs and trucks. Both stocks surged in the wake of their reports.One company moving higher after reporting before the bell Thursday is LendingTree ( TREE )  . The online financial services firm reported adjusted earnings of $1.92 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.78 and improving 64% from the year-ago quarter. Revenue in the period was $197.1 million, which marked year-over-year growth of 15%.LendingTree also raised its full-year 2018 guidance. The company now expects revenue to be in the range of $765 million to $775 million, up from the prior range of $745 million to $765 million. Investors loved this beat-and-raise quarter, and LendingTree was up more than 18% in early morning trading today.However, not every pre-marker reporter was moving in a positive direction Thursday. One notable company selling off after its earnings announcement is Spotify ( SPOT )  . The music streaming giant recorded quarterly revenue of 1.35 billion euros ($1.54 billion), which did edge out Street estimates of 1.33 billion euros.   Spotify also reported that its monthly subscribers, which account for about 90% of its revenue, increased to 87 million from 83 million in the previous quarter. However, the Swedish company narrowed its expectations for full-year monthly active listeners slightly, and Wall Street was not impressed. Shares of Spotify opened more than 10% lower this morning.Another trendy stock making a sharp move to the downside in early trading is Wayfair ( W )  . On an adjusted basis, Wayfair saw a quarterly loss of $1.28 per share, which was wider than the $1.12 loss expected by the Zacks Consensus.Revenue was slightly higher than expectations, coming in at $1.71 billion against a consensus estimate of $1.67 billion. Active users were up a healthy 35%, but Wayfair's earnings miss underscored fears that the e-commerce marketplace will struggle to turn profitable with its current business model.Looking ahead, investors still have a number of marquee earnings announcements to prepare for in this Q3 report season, including that of Apple AAPL  -due out this afternoon. While today's pre-market results were mixed, Wall Street will be hoping that the overall trend is positive as earnings season winds down.

 By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Nov 1 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose for a third straight day on Thursday as President Donald Trump said trade talks with China were "moving along nicely," reviving hopes that the two countries can resolve their trade dispute. Adding to optimism, the latest round of results from companies were mostly upbeat. The trade-sensitive S&P industrial sector  rose 2 percent, with Boeing Co  and Caterpillar Inc  among companies leading the gains. "Maybe there's going to be some hope that a trade deal with China will actually come through," said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist, senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. The S&P materials index  was up 2.7 percent, with DowDuPont Inc  surging after its strong results and a $3 billion share buyback.  Apple Inc  was up slightly ahead of its results, due after the bell.

Also helping was robust earnings reports from three Apple suppliers, NXP Semiconductors, Dialog Semiconductor  and Qorvo Inc. Technology-related stocks have led the stock market's bull run in recent years. The S&P tech index's 8 percent pullback in October was its worst monthly loss since March 2012. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.80-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 31 new highs and 48 new lows.

Comparing units outstanding versus one week ago at the coverage universe of ETFs at ETF Channel, the biggest inflow was seen in the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF ( IVV  ), which added 9,800,000 units, or a 1.7% increase week over week. Among the largest underlying components of IVV, in morning trading today Apple ( AAPL  ) is down about 0.4%, and Microsoft ( MSFT  ) is lower by about 0.7%.        VIDEO: IVV, GUSH: Big ETF Inflows  
Wall Street witnessed wild swings in October, thanks to multiple woes including rising interest rates, political turbulence in Italy, Saudi tensions, tech sell-off, escalating US-China trade war and the prelude to mid-term election. The chaos resulted in S&P 500 posting its worst monthly performance since 2011.
 After slipping into a correction territory, the index rebounded somewhat this week to close at down 6.9% for the month, buoyed by a slew of strong earnings as well as upbeat economic data that lifted investors' sentiment. According to data from Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices, the S&P 500 plunge shaved off $1.91 trillion in market cap last month with Amazon AMZN , Microsoft MSFT , NVIDIA NVDA , Facebook FB and Apple AAPL bearing the brunt.
 The slowdown in global growth, especially in a few developing and developed economies, added to the woes.

 Another Thursday morning, another terrific Initial Jobless Claims headline: 214K new claims arrived last week, down from the upwardly revised 216K (215K originally reported last week) and squarely within the historically robust 200-225K weekly jobless claims number. As the summer turned to autumn we saw these weekly headlines dwindle toward sub-200K, which would present another leg up in a long-term extraordinary jobs growth picture.Continuing Claims also trickled lower last week, from 1.638 million the previous week to 1.631 million in this latest read. This is consistent with what we've seen in past months and with weekly claims: a perpetual lowering of the numbers in this metric, from well above 300K following the Great Recession a decade ago to breaking beneath 200K in the past year or so.
 We saw ADP's ADP private-sector payroll numbers hit the tape yesterday, for a total of 227K - well above the 100K or so new jobs we need to offset retiring Baby Boomers on a month-to-month basis, and pushing analysts to increase their expectations for tomorrow's non-farm payroll results from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) from the 180-190K range to 200K or higher. We also look forward to a new Unemployment Rate, last read at another historically low number, 3.7%, which many analysts also see going down to sub-3.5% in the near future.U.S. Productivity in Q3 came in a tad light from expectations to 2.2%, and lower than the previous read of 3.0% (which was itself revised upward by 10 basis points). Commensurate Unit Labor Costs ticked up higher than expectations to +1.2%, and a swing to positive on costs from -1.0% last quarter. This nudges along the narrative that wage increases are on the move upward as the strong labor market continues to tighten. It's been a long time for wage growth metrics to start hitting the economic numbers, but there are unmistakably here now. We'll be playing close attention to these numbers in tomorrow's BLS report.
 While this is all great news for the U.S. economy and its workforce overall, it's less than scintillating for those investors hoping the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates lower for longer. At a bank-to-bank range of 2.00-2.25%, interest rates aren't close to inverting the yield curve and are no longer outpacing inflation. Rising interest rates are intended to curb inflation hitting the economy, among other things, which we're clearly seeing in our aforementioned jobs reports, and there's no reason to suspect at this time that the Fed will choose to do anything other than raise rates another 25 basis points to 2.25-2.50% at its December meeting.
 Q3 earnings season continues as well today, with no report more important than that of the world's largest publicly traded company, the $1.05 trillion market-cap Apple Inc. AAPL , whose earnings release comes out after the closing bell this afternoon. With 8 upward analyst revisions on the company in the past 60 days, the Zacks consensus estimates going into the earnings report are for $2.79 per share on $61.49 billion in quarterly sales. These represent year over year gains of 35% and 17%, respectively.
 However, this being the period of volatility it is, many think that should Apple merely meet these still-impressive forecasts, the stock will sell off in late trading today. The company has not missed earnings expectations since Q1 2016, which was its only miss in the last 20 quarters. The 4-quarter average positive earnings surprise for Apple is roughly 5.5%.
 But if Apple does not put out strong numbers on its key segments beyond iPhone sales - Services, China and its App Store, in particular - expect traders to sell shares of the largest Dow component going into tomorrow's opening bell. Apple is trading up 27% year to date in an overall market that is basically flat. Then again, a blowout fiscal Q4 2018 report could send futures higher overall.
 We're all counting on you, Tim Cook…

Investors in Apple Inc.AAPL need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Nov 2, 2018 $207.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?
 Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?
 Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Apple shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Apple is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Computer - Mini computers industry that ranks in the Top 44% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, four analysts have increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a $2.75 per share to $2.79 in that period.
 Given the way analysts feel about Apple right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there's a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?

Can a strong Apple (AAPL) earnings report and confident guidance stop the decline in tech stocks?Fresh on the heels of sprucing up its hardware line with new Macs and iPads, Apple will report earnings results after the closing bell Thursday. Apple is the only remaining FAANG — Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google (GOOG , GOOGL) — that has yet to report, and what the company reveals Thursday could be the catalyst the market needs to reverse the downward spiral investors have experienced.In the three months that ended September, Wall Street expect the Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant to earn $2.78 per share on revenue of $61.59 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to $2.07 per share on revenue of $52.58 billion. For the full year, earnings are expected to rise 29% year over year to $11.79 per share, while full-year revenue of $264.03 billion would rise 15.2% year over year.Apple shares have held up much better than most tech stocks during the recent selloff. The shares have actually risen some 13% in the past three months, compared to the 5% decline in the S&P 500 index during that same span. And much of Apple’s strength has been due to the company’s stellar earnings track record.It’s likely for this reason Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives last week noted Apple shares can reach $310, assigning Apple with the highest price estimate on the Street, suggesting some 45% upside from current levels of around $213. How quickly Apple can reach that target depends on how many iPhones, particularly the more expensive iPhone X models, Apple sold during the quarter. Ives believes that about 350 million iPhones could be upgraded in the next 12-18 months.The Street will be looking for fourth quarter iPhone unit sales of 47 million, which would market a 1% increased year over year. And this is where higher average selling prices (ASP) will provide a boost to revenue despite the meager unit growth. The company, as recent as September, introduced the new iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max. Contribution from these three new models will be minimal. But the bet is on the all-important holiday quarter when those devices are expected to pay huge dividends.On Thursday analysts will also focus on Apple’s sales figures in China — its second largest market. Reports of the recent decline of the Chinese Yuan, which makes iPhones in China more expensive, has been a concern. In the third quarter, Apple experience sequential declines in revenue across all geographic regions. Sales in Greater China came in at $9.55 billion, which was down 27% on the quarter but up 19% on the year. It remains to be seen what impact the Chinese Yuan and the tariffs will have on this quarter.Services revenue, which has a current run rate of $33.4 billion and includes Apple Music, the App Store and Apple Pay, will be another area of focus. Third quarter Services revenue surged 31%  year over year to the all-time high $9.55 billion, topping the $9.2 billion analysts were looking for. Another solid showing in the Services segment, combined with stronger APS’s, should affirm the strong relative support the share price has already demonstrated.

A Key Detail of Apple's 2019 iPhones May Have Just Been Confirmed
 In its 2016 and 2017 flagship iPhone products,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) used cellular modems sourced from both wireless   leader   Qualcomm    (NASDAQ: QCOM) as well as challenger   Intel    (NASDAQ: INTC) . This meant that for those two product   generations, the advertised cellular capabilities of the devices   were limited to what Intel's modems could deliver.Then, earlier this year, Apple announced three new iPhones,   all of which are powered exclusively by Intel's XMM 7560 LTE   modem. It was possible for Apple to use Intel modems in all its   iPhones because Intel added support for the CDMA and EVDO   standards in the XMM 7560, allowing devices powered by the modem   to be used on networks that utilize those standards. Last   quarter, Intel reported that its modem revenue   grew 131% from the same period a year ago    .  Image source: Intel.Just recently, Intel published a product brief for its   upcoming XMM 7660, which I expect Apple will use in its 2019   iPhone lineup. Let's look at the implications for those   devices.Intel says that the XMM 7660 supports "LTE Advanced Pro speeds   up to 1.6 [gigabits per second] download and 150 [megabits per   second] upload."According to the company, the XMM 7560 solution that's   currently being shipped supports speeds "exceeding 1 [gigabit per   second] download and 150 [megabits per second] upload." So, at   least on paper, peak download speeds go up by about 60% while   peak upload speeds stay the same.What this all means is that when Apple announces its new   flagship iPhones in less than a year, it will be able to tell   customers that the new devices support much faster download   speeds than the previous generation did.Apple has been using Intel's LTE modems for three generations   now, starting with the XMM 7360 in 2016, moving to the XMM 7480   in 2017, and the XMM 7560 this year. With each successive   generation, the number of simultaneous LTE bands that the   company's modems support has steadily risen.Source: Intel.Back in 2015, analyst Pat Moorhead   explained    that because Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus came in variants   that "in some cases support 20 Bands at the same time," this   "gives Apple the ability to support many regions at once and   simultaneously gives consumers the freedom to switch between   carriers freely as well as travel internationally without too   much concern for coverage."With the XMM 7660, Intel seems to have delivered its biggest   jump yet in the number of simultaneous LTE bands that it can   support in a single phone   SKU. A little while back, analysts with Bernstein Research   claimed    that the baseband processor that would be part of the XMM 7660   solution would be manufactured using Intel's 14-nanometer (nm)   technology. That's the same technology used to build the XMM   7560's baseband processor, known as the X-GOLD 756.As it happens, the analysts were right, and Intel confirmed in   its product brief that XMM 7660's baseband -- known as the X-GOLD   766 -- is also crafted using 14nm technology. Intel didn't   specify in its XMM 7660 brief that it was referring to its own   14nm technology, as it had in the XMM 7560's product brief. But   the company tells me that this, in fact, refers to Intel's own   14nm technology.Over the span of three generations, Intel has evolved from a   second source in Apple's latest iPhones to its sole source. That   has added noticeable revenue to the company's client computing   group. And according to interim CEO and CFO Bob Swan, the growth   in modem shipments is "accretive to [Intel's] year-on-year   earnings growth," though he conceded that it's "dilutive to   [Intel's]   gross margins    ".Intel now needs to hang on to its sole-source position in   iPhones. This means that the company must continue to   successfully crank out modems that keep pace with Apple's annual   iPhone product lineup. Over the next couple of years, that will   entail delivering on the XMM 7660 and making sure the roll-out of   its first 5G modem -- known as the XMM 8060 -- goes smoothly.

Here are highlights from Wednesday's Analyst   Blog:   Apple Roundup: Regulatory, Privacy, TV, iPhone &     More  Apple had an eventful month that included regulatory pressures, privacy issues, Apple TV advancements, positive reviews and an acquisition to boost Music, ending with upgrades to its iPads and MacBooks. Here is a brief recap, as we prepare for its earnings report tomorrow- Italy Fines Apple Software updates slowing down older devices is an old problem but Italian authorities taking exception to it is a new one. Last week, they fined Apple and Samsung 5 million euros ($5.7 million) each for issuing updates that seriously slowed down devices and caused them to malfunction. This pushed customers to upgrade their devices.An additional 5 million euros was demanded of Apple for failing to give clients clear information about how to maintain or eventually replace handset batteries.Apple admitted last year that some updates did slow down devices and subsequently agreed to partly cover battery replacement cost. Apple Opposes Aussie Bill Earlier this month, Apple raised concerns regarding Australia's Access and Assistance Bill 2018. While appreciating certain aspects of the bill, Apple says the government's move to mandate backdoors for access to user data is dangerous and could help hackers instead. The main problems highlighted were:·         Overly broad powers that could weaken cybersecurity and encryption·         A lack of appropriate independent judicial oversight·         Technical requirements based only on the government's subjective view of reasonableness and practicability·         Unprecedented interception requirements·         Unnecessarily stifling secrecy mandates·         Extraterritoriality and global impactSubmissions were accepted til Oct 12. Other Privacy Matters A new tool will allow Apple customers in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand see and download all information that Apple has collected on them and make changes to the data, suspend their Apple account or even permanently delete it. The feature is a necessary part of the EU's GDPR that Apple is taking elsewhere.Being a hardware-focused company with a highly overpriced product line, Apple usually maintains the data on the users' devices and encrypts it upon transfer.Apple has used its position on data collection as a competitive differentiator against Facebook and Google, which don't charge for their basic services and instead use the data collected on devices to sell ads and develop artificial intelligence. Of course there are both positive and negative sides to this data collection that the world of technology and governments haven't resolved yet. On Apple TV As a result of the close integration of PlayStation Vue, Sony's streaming video service, PS Vue subscribers can now watch their favorite shows whether on-demand or live not only from the PS Vue app but also from the TV app on Apple TV, iPhone and iPad.Once users log in to their Vue account, Apple will start pulling in shows, including on-demand programming from cable channels and live sports from national and regional networks, displaying it in its "Watch Now" (on-demand offerings) and "Up Next" (helps you pick up where you left off watching programs) sections.Meanwhile, Apple is also getting ready to launch its own Pay TV subscription service in 100+ countries to compete with rival offerings from Netflix and Amazon, starting with the U.S. in early 2019. Analyst Sees Surge In Cheaper iPhone XR Famed Apple Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has high expectations of the lowest-priced of Apple's latest iPhone models, the XR. The accuracy of his predictions stems from his close ties with people in Apple's supply chain.The model didn't look as popular at first because pre-orders didn't sell out, but Kuo points out that demand was still stronger than the 8 and 8 Plus. Moreover, preorders sell out because of enthusiast demand whereas the typical XR, which has an entry-level price of $749 attracts the kind of person who is probably used to operating iOS, who favors the Apple brand, has a limited budget or no urgent replacement demand.For such people, the "larger display, longer battery life, dual SIM-support, and new form factor design" of the LCD device are attractive. This is a solid group of Apple loyalists who can ultimately help the XR outsell the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max.Based on these factors, Kuo raised his iPhone XR shipment estimate in the fourth quarter by 10% to 37 million. He also expects shipments to decline 25-30% in the first quarter, beating the typical 30-40% seasonal decline on most consumer electronics and the 45-50% decline seen by the iPhone 8. This will push total iPhone shipments to 77.5 million in the current quarter and 57.5 million in the following quarter, with XR accounting for half of all sales. Buys Music Analytics Company Asaii After swallowing music discovery company Shazam, Apple has moved on to other fish. Asaii, the company's latest acquisition that was reportedly acquired for less than $100 million, will further boost its Music offerings once Apple puts its signature dashboard to work for it.The company pulls in data from both music services and social media in a way that surfaces artists that are most likely to make it big. So while it also allows record labels plan marketing campaigns and live tours, it helps them sign on the people that will make them a lot of money.Apple may also use its recommendation algorithm to boost its playlists the way Spotify does with its Daily Mix and Discover Weekly services. News Success The New York Times reports that Apple news has around 90 million voracious readers, generating a million page views per story. Editor in Chief Lauren Kern feels that Apple's success stems from its hand curated reading list that uses only trustworthy sources and does away with fake news.This differs she feels from the algorithmic approach that other news aggregation services take. But advertisers get jittery because they don't get much ad revenue and also can't access customer data. There's also the concern that some bias comes in, which of course is also a part of the algorithmic approach that is ultimately set up by humans.

 6:24 a.m.  The Dow is trying to start November the way it ended October  -with some still elusive gains. S&P 500  futures have risen 0.4%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average  futures have gained 110 points, or 0.4%. Nasdaq Composite  futures have advanced 0.3%.And why shouldn't they? Facebook's  (FB) earnings after Tuesday's close  convinced at least some investors that it was safe to go back in the tech water, while Wednesday's ADP report  suggested that the U.S. economy was still strong. Those, however, were just the appetizers for the main course: Apple's  (AAPL) earnings after Thursday's close  and Friday's nonfarm payrolls release. Both could confirm what we saw-or cause investors to start selling once again. "[Solid] ADP employment data helped calm investors' nerves propelling the major indices upwards," writes Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADSS. "We expect this rebound to extend until tomorrow's NFPs report and depending on how this prints we may see a further continuation or a reversal lower  again."But at least we can enjoy today.

One Last Chance to Capitalize on High Volatilities During Earnings Season
Thursday after the close, Apple (AAPL) will be the last big-cap tech stock to report earnings this season. We've seen fairly good results so far, but in some cases, various items have given investors cause for concern. Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG) both beat estimates on the bottom line but saw their shares punished because of concerns about slowing revenue growth. Microsoft (MSFT) saw a 6% rally the day after it reported top and bottom line beats and Facebook (FB) traded in both positive and negative territory after a strong report, eventually finishing up almost 4% on the day after earnings.Throughout the month of October, volatility was the rule and unfortunately for the big tech stocks, the results were mostly negative. The S&P 500 gave up nearly 10% - essentially all of its gains for the year - and most of the big tech stocks fared about the same. Amazon did much worse - losing 20% of its value on the month - and giving up its spot in the Trillion Dollar market-cap club.The steadiest and best performer during the October volatility was Apple, which lost less than 4% and experienced significantly less price volatility than even the broad market indexes.Though shares of Apple have been less volatile than the indexes, implied option volatilities on Apple are higher. Because of Apple's enormous market cap, it is the largest holding in index funds and ETFs, at 6% of the S&P 500 and 13% of the Nasdaq 100. Thanks to high implied volatilities in the indexes and the associated volatility arbitrage opportunities, Apple vols rise when market vols rise. The upcoming earnings announcement exacerbates the effect.Over the past four years, Apple has made a habit of just slightly beating the consensus earnings estimates. Take a look at the Price, Consensus and Surprise chart below. You'll notice 18 small green arrows signifying small positive earnings surprises and one small red arrow - a small earnings miss.The average move in AAPL shares the day after earnings reports during the last nine quarters is just 4.15%. The November 200 strike straddle is currently priced at approximately $16, implying a 7% move between now and expiration which is 16 days away.This appears to represent a selling opportunity, but simply selling a straddle is fairly dangerous because if Apple were to experience a significant move between now and expiration, the risk is theoretically unlimited.We can control that risk and still capitalize on relatively high implied volatilities by selling an "iron butterfly" in which we sell the at-the-money straddle and simultaneously purchase an out-of-the-money strangle.The current market prices of the options are:                                                Bid                          Ask210 put                                  $4.50                     $4.70220 put                                  $8.10                     $8.40220 call                                 $7.10                     $7.30230 call                                 $2.95                     $3.10If we sell the straddle and buy the strangle near the middle of the bid-ask spreads, we can collect $7.70.  Because the most this spread can be worth is $10, our maximum loss is only $2.30 per spread.If Apple shares are lower than $210 or higher than $230 at expiration, we will suffer the maximum loss, but at only $230/spread, the max loss is quite manageable. If Apple stays close to $220, we will collect most or even all of the premium we collected.Of course, the chance of predicting the exact price of any stock on a particular day  - especially options expiration - is quite small, and so therefore are the chances of making the maximum profit on this trade. The goal is to collect as much of the relatively high premiums as possible.One more thing to keep in mind is that since we'll be short the higher premium options, we will have to either buy back one or both of the short options or trade the stock to close the trade. If we simply keep the spread on until expiration, and the stock is between $210 and $230/share, we'll end up either long or short 100 shares of Apple as a result.Wall Street's Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It's a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius. Click for details >>

As American technology companies anxiously await results from midterm elections  next week that could result in a spurt of regulatory measures if Democrats win the House, they might also want to pay close attention to Europe.Multiple tech taxes are in play in the region, led by a 2% levy on sales of digital services in the United Kingdom that could significantly impact Google parent Alphabet  (GOOGL), Amazon  (AMZN), and Facebook  (FB) starting in April 2020. (Those companies currently pay taxes on U.K. profits.)The proposed U.K. Digital Services Tax  is "narrowly targeted" at "U.K.-generated revenues" of profitable tech companies with global revenues of at least £500 million ($640 million) a year. "It will be carefully designed to ensure it is established tech giants, rather than our tech startups, that shoulder the burden," U.K. Finance Minister Philip Hammond said in a speech before the House of Commons this week.Hammond did not mention companies by name, but the tax is intended for digital business platform services such as search engines, online marketplaces, and social media firms.Amazon and Facebook declined comment. Google and Apple  (AAPL) did not respond to e-mail messages seeking comment.Amazon, Facebook, and Google have long been criticized for underpaying taxes in the U.K. Facebook's revenue in the U.K. quadrupled to $985 million on increased ad sales in 2016, but it paid just $6 million in corporation tax, according to a 2017 report in The Guardian  . As public anger has escalated over the amount of taxes paid by Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google in the U.K., the British government has repeatedly floated the idea of imposing a tax on tech giants without stifling innovation from startups and driving away established businesses. The enmity extends at least to 2012, when a British parliamentary committee accused executives from Amazon and Google of tax dodging.Conversely, at least one tech association in Britain says the proposed tax goes too far and would ensnare smaller companies, jeopardizing investments in the U.K. and harming the economy. "This approach risks undermining the U.K.'s reputation as the best place to start a tech business or to invest," techUK Chief Executive Julian David said in a statement."The tax is an acknowledgment of the financial force of the digital economy, and an attempt to address it under an existing tax system," Samuel Brunson, a tax law professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law, told Barron's. "I don't think this would dissuade a tech company from locating in the U.K."The new tax, which Hammond intends to introduce, many other countries are contemplating similar moves. France, Germany, Italy, and Spain have called for a turnover tax on U.S. tech companies to compensate for tax-avoidance maneuvers. Europe has already been a trailblazer in legislation around large tech companies. The General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect in May, imposes stricter online privacy rules. Violators face fines of 20 million euros or 4% of global revenue, whichever is higher.Governments worldwide lose up to $240 billion annually from tax-avoidance strategies, according to a 2015 estimate by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. For example, the tech industry's practice of using Ireland  as a tax haven has saved it billions of dollars for years. Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft  (MSFT), Twitter  (TWTR), and eBay  (EBAY) have corporate facilities in Ireland, where they have benefited from significantly lower corporate tax rates (12.5% compared with 21% currently in the U.S.).Facebook is an interesting case study. In April 2016, it changed U.K. operations so that revenue from customers there was supported by its local sales support and recorded in the U.K.. Any taxable profit from such income is subject to U.K. corporation tax. Facebook in the last year has built and opened a new London office and said it plans to hire 500 employees in 2018 to bring its U.K. work force to about 2,300.

Spotify faults itself for margin gains; stock hits new lows
 By Eric Auchard and Olof Swahnberg LONDON/STOCKHOLM, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Spotify  sent its shares tumbling as much as 10 percent on Thursday after the world's most popular paid music streaming service said it would continue to sacrifice profit margins to generate future growth. The Swedish company came close to making its first-ever operating profit in the third quarter, years ahead of schedule,  which the company said was because it had not been spending heavily enough to hire more engineers. Spotify pledged to accelerate the pace of investments in research and development in new music services and additional content during 2019, which the company said would reduce its operating margins "for the foreseeable future." Hit by the global tech stock sell-off over the past month, Spotify's shares have given up their 30 percent gain since their stock market debut in April on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares dropped to $137.73 in early trading following the third-quarter report, which showed gains in paid subscribers, revenue and gross margins that were roughly in line with market expectations. The stock closed at $149 on its first trading day. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst George Salmon said the performance was much better than forecast. "However, much of this improvement is due to costs not increasing as fast as expected, due to shortfalls in hiring," he said, noting that these issues have continued in fourth quarter. Third-quarter operating margin shrank to a negative 0.5 percent from negative 7.1 percent in recent quarters. Spotify reported an operating loss of 6 million euros after previously guiding investors to expect losses between 10-90 million euros. "Unfortunately profitability is no good (and) that's too bad," Tomas Otterbeck, an analyst with research firm Redeye in Stockholm, said, referring to the company's determination to prioritise revenue growth over profitability for years to come. The company tightened its expectations for full-year 2018 monthly active listeners to between 199 million to 206 million users. Analysts, on average, had been predicting 208 million users by the end of the year. Monthly subscribers, which deliver 90 percent of revenue, rose to 87 million, up from 83 million in the second quarter ending June, it said. The latest results matched the average forecast in a Thomson Reuters analyst poll. Total users rose to 191 million, including free, advertising-supported listeners. 
 BALANCING ACT Spotify is seeking to develop a "two-sided marketplace" that connects both artists and recording industry labels to consumers but in non-traditional ways, using data on listener behaviour to generate popular playlists that drive revenue to rights holders. During the third quarter, Spotify expanded its direct licensing of musicians and their recordings, which it says about 250,000 artists have signed up for so far. But Spotify still relies on striking licensing agreements with major record labels, which account for the vast majority of music streams on its service. The company is entering into re-negotiations with the labels during 2019. "We've made it clear that our strategy is not to become a label, and not to compete with labels," Chief Financial Officer Barry McCarthy told reporters on a conference call. "(Spotify and the labels) have developed a mutual dependency on each other. It's in both our economic interest to achieve a constructive outcome," he said. McCarthy said he aimed to convince music labels that Spotify remained a music industry ally and that its efforts to support independent artists and other distribution partners would expand the market for all major parties. In the previous round of music licensing negotiations, record labels increased Spotify's share of royalties to around 25 percent of revenues from around 15 percent. McCarthy declined to comment when asked if the label renegotiations would potentially mean improved margins for Spotify. Gross margins rose to 25.3 percent from 22.3 percent in the third quarter of 2017. Analysts were looking for margins around 24.9 percent, according to the Thomson Reuters poll. ($1 = 0.8789 euros) 
 
Music streaming leader Spotify reports modest rise in paid users

 By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Global stocks began the new month buoyantly on Thursday after a brutal October while the pound rallied on reports that Britain and the European Union were close to a post-Brexit deal on financial services. A hint from the Bank of England of slightly faster future rate rises also helped the pound further. October was the index's worst month since May 2012 - a loss of 7.5 percent - as shares globally took a battering on a number of factors ranging from trade wars to concerns about the global economy and higher U.S. interest rates. European markets followed a strong start in Asia, with robust company earnings helping the pan-European STOXX 600  index touch a two-week high.  Britain's FTSE 100  was flat, however, as the pound strengthened on a report Britain and the EU were advancing towards a deal that would give financial services firms in the UK continued access to European markets once Brexit happens.  The pound extended its rally on Thursday after the Bank of England kept interest rates on hold and hinted at slightly faster future rate rises if Brexit goes smoothly.  S&P 500 futures were up about 0.3 percent. Eyes were on iPhone-maker Apple, reporting its third quarter results later in the day.  The MSCI index of developing-world stocks  rose 0.8 percent and was on track for a one-week high, as Chinese stocks,  rose on the latest in a round of official measures to support the domestic markets.  "It is worth noting that such a sharp month of (equity) outflows - a rare occurrence - tends to be a buying opportunity," the Institute of International Finance (IIF) said in a note, referring to emerging markets in the October exodus. "In the 4 months we have on record since the 2008-09 crisis that have seen least $10 billion in equity outflows. The subsequent 12 months saw an average of $65 billion in inflows." Onshore, China's yuan  strengthened past 6.95 per dollar. A Reuters poll of analysts showed Chinese authorities will defend the yuan from weakening past 7 per dollar, although some expected the currency to breach that level. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  rose 0.7 percent, adding to modest gains the previous day. The index had fallen 10.2 percent in October, its worst monthly performance since August 2015. The improved mood had filtered down to Asia from Wall Street, which rose for a second day on Wednesday as strong company results and bargain hunting of beaten-down technology and internet favourites lifted spirits.  Hong Kong's Hang Seng  rose 1.5 percent on Thursday and the Shanghai Composite Index  climbed 0.2 percent. Japan's Nikkei  bucked the trend and slipped 1 percent following two days of big gains. 
 RISK SENTIMENT RECOVERS In currencies, sterling's rally nudged the dollar off its recent peak. The index measuring the greenback's strength against a basket of six major currencies  was down 0.7 percent at 96.437.  The index had spiked to a 16-month high of 97.20 overnight on a ADP national employment report showing U.S. private sector payrolls increased by the most in eight months in October.  The dollar has enjoyed a boost from robust data, including last week's GDP numbers which showed the U.S. economy slowed less than expected in the third quarter. The Australian dollar and the Kiwi dollar were up 1.4 percent and 1.7 percent respectively after strong domestic trade data helped offset some of the concerns about slowing growth in China - Australia's biggest trading partner. "We've got a reasonably risk-friendly market, and with the new month we have some dollar selling," said Kit Juckes, a strategist at Societe Generale. In another sign of improving risk sentiment, Scandinavian currencies - the Norwegian crown and Swedish crown - rallied as well. The euro rose over 0.75 percent to $1.1376  after retreating to $1.1302 on Wednesday, its lowest since mid-August.  The single currency has been weighed by less-than-stellar economic news from the euro zone. In commodities, U.S. crude futures  were down 0.35 percent at $65.08 per barrel, while Brent crude  lost 0.5 percent to $74.62 per barrel.  The two benchmarks remained on the back foot after falling more than $10 from a four-year peak reached early in October as broader market ructions were seen hurting demand for fuel. 
 
 By Douglas Busvine FRANKFURT, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Dialog Semiconductor  expects revenues to grow in the mid-teens after a $600 million deal with Apple  to transfer patents and programmers key to making the iPhone's main power chip. The landmark deal buys time for the Anglo-German chip designer, which relies on Apple for three-quarters of sales, to reinvent itself as a more diversified firm that will target new markets such as the Internet of Things.  "We are not going to fall off a cliff," Chief Executive Jalal Bagherli told Reuters in an interview. The longer-term forecast for revenue growth in the mid-teens applies to the Dialog operations not covered by the Apple deal. Dialog's shares jumped by a third on Oct. 11, the day of the Apple deal. They gained another 7 percent following the strategy update, extending their rally on the back of Wednesday's forecast-beating third-quarter results.  Bagherli was due to hold a strategy briefing with analysts in London on Thursday and ahead of the event the company provided its first guidance on its outlook for 2019. The Apple deal will not have any impact on the current year. With the proceeds from the deal adding to the $617 million already on hand, Bagherli said Dialog would seek to grow through mergers and acquisitions. He said that Dialog was looking at several potential targets to supplement its existing strengths, but would exercise financial discipline. "We are not looking at acquisitions that require massive leverage," he told Reuters. Around half of the proceeds of the Apple deal would go towards running the business, leaving the remainder, plus cash on hand, free for takeovers or share buybacks. Dialog said on Wednesday it would spend up to 150 million euros on buying back nearly a tenth of its shares. 
 STABLE MARGINS, NEW PRODUCTS Dialog's longer-term guidance telegraphed a message of continuity. The company expects underlying gross margins of between 47 and 48 percent, a fraction below its third-quarter performance of 48.6 percent. It sees its underlying operating margin at between 18 and 23 percent, compared to a third-quarter outturn of 21.8 percent. Dialog, which has no chip production assets of its own, is more tied to the fortunes of Apple than it is to the broader semiconductor industry cycle, where Korean electronics giant Samsung Electronics  has warned that a two-year boom in memory chips could be ending. It wants to shake off that image by deploying its expertise in so-called mixed-signal integrated circuits - which can handle both analogue and digital signals - to capture new market opportunities. Dialog claims market leadership in rapid-charging and configurable chips that are used, for example, to power up smartphones. It is number two in Bluetooth low-energy products that connect wearable devices like fitness trackers. Bagherli said he saw new opportunities in the Internet of Things that comprises connected 'smart' devices, such as Bluetooth-enabled styluses for tablets or for tyre-pressure monitors. Dialog is also talking to pharmaceutical companies about designing chips for devices such as insulin pumps and glucose meters, part of an e-healthcare trend where patients can self-medicate while their condition is monitored remotely. Another new product area Dialog hopes to move into is gaming consoles, whose power-management demands are similar to those of smartphones or tablets, Bagherli said. 
 
 By Douglas Busvine FRANKFURT, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Dialog Semiconductor  expects revenues to grow in the mid-teens next year after a $600 million deal with Apple  to transfer patents and programmers key to making the iPhone's main power chip.

Bagherli was due to hold a strategy briefing with analysts in London on Thursday and ahead of the event the company provided its first guidance on its outlook for 2019. The Apple deal will not have any impact on the current year. The company said overall revenues for 2019 would be roughly in line with this year's forecast of $1.46 billion. On a like-for-like basis, after stripping out the operations that will go to Apple, the top line will grow in the mid-teens. With the Apple deal proceeds adding to the $617 million already on hand, Dialog said it had the financial flexibility to pursue growth, including through mergers and acquisitions, while continuing its policy of returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks. Dialog said on Wednesday it would spend up to 150 million euros on buying back nearly a tenth of its shares.

 Nov 1 Reuters - Apple Inc  has held talks with iHeartMedia Inc  to take a stake in the U.S. radio company, the Financial Times on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter (graphic). The discussions between the two companies remain at a preliminary stage and no deal has been agreed, the report said, citing sources. iHeartMedia is hoping the iPhone maker will take an equity stake worth millions of dollars, the FT reported citing one of the sources. iHeartMedia filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in March, after reaching an agreement with creditors to more than halve its $20 billion debt. In June, John Malone's Liberty Media withdrew its proposal to invest in iHeartMedia.  Apple and iHeartMedia did not immediately respond to requests for comments. 
 
 By Guy Faulconbridge and Paul Sandle LONDON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Silicon Valley technology giants such as Facebook  and Google  have grown so dominant they may need to be broken up, unless challengers or changes in taste reduce their clout, the inventor of the World Wide Web told Reuters. The digital revolution has spawned a handful of U.S.-based technology companies since the 1990s that now have a combined financial and cultural power greater than most sovereign states. "What naturally happens is you end up with one company dominating the field so through history there is no alternative to really coming in and breaking things up," Berners-Lee, 63, said in an interview. "There is a danger of concentration." But he urged caution too, saying the speed of innovation in both technology and tastes could ultimately cut some of the biggest technology companies down to size. "Before breaking them up, we should see whether they are not just disrupted by a small player beating them out of the market, but by the market shifting, by the interest going somewhere else," Berners-Lee said. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook have a combined market capitalisation of $3.7 trillion, equal to Germany's gross domestic product last year. 
 LOVE AND HATE Berners-Lee came up with the idea for what he initially called "Mesh" while working at Europe's physics research centre CERN, calling it the World Wide Web in 1990. When asked who had the biggest intellectual influence on him, he said: "Mum and Dad." "They were building computers, so I grew up living in a world where everything was mathematics and the excitement of being able to programme something was very fresh," he said. There was, he said, no 'Eureka' moment. Instead, it was hard work, the experience of working in computer science and an attempt to overcome the frustrations of trying to share information with colleagues and students. "Eureka moments are complete nonsense. I don't even believe the one about Archimedes. He had been thinking about it for a long time," he said. Now a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Oxford, Berners-Lee expressed dismay at the way consultancy Cambridge Analytica obtained the personal data of 87 million Facebook users from a researcher. That scandal, he said, was a tipping point for many. "I am disappointed with the current state of the Web," he said. "We have lost the feeling of individual empowerment and to a certain extent also I think the optimism has cracked." Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologised after the Cambridge Analytica scandal and pledged to do more to protect users' data. But social media, Berners-Lee said, was still being used to propagate hate. "If you put a drop of love into Twitter it seems to decay but if you put in a drop of hatred you feel it actually propagates much more strongly. And you wonder: 'Well is that because of the way that Twitter as a medium has been built?'" 
 
 Shares of Apple AAPL  climbed 2.6% during regular trading hours Wednesday as part of a larger market resurgence that saw Facebook FB  , Netflix NFLX  , and eBay EBAY  all climb. Apple's jump might signal that investors are excited about the iPhone power's Q4 financial results Thursday. Let's look to see what they should really expect. Q4 Overview Apple recently introduced its new iPad Pros and its latest MacBook Air at a launch event in Brooklyn. In September, Apple CEO Tim Cook and other executives showed off the firm's new iPhone XR, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and the Apple Watch Series 4. But this new lineup of products will hardly, if at all, show up on Apple's fourth-quarter earnings results since its fiscal quarter ended on September 30.Still, Apple's total quarterly revenues are expected to climb by 16.95% to hit $61.49 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. More specifically, Apple's total iPhone unit sales are projected to climb less than 1% to reach 46.954 million, based on our latest NFM estimates. Luckily, higher prices look poised to lift total iPhone revenues in a big way.Apple's Q4 iPhone revenues are projected to hit $35.651 billion. This would mark a roughly 23.5% climb. Investors should also note that Apple's expanding services business, which includes Apple Pay and Apple Music, is projected to jump 24% from $8.501 billion year-ago period to hit $10.546 billion.     Earnings Plus, Apple is projected to see its adjusted Q4 earnings soar by 34.8% to reach $2.79 per share. With that said, we still need to know how likely it is that Apple tops our quarterly earnings estimates.To prepare for this, we can turn to our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file. The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non-financial metrics reported by companies. The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts.The Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter. The Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Apple is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that sports an Earnings ESP of +1.35%. Therefore, investors can consider Apple a company that has a solid chance of topping our quarterly earnings estimate. Apple has also beat our quarterly earnings estimates in nine out of the last 10 periods.Apple is scheduled to report its fourth quarter financial results after the closing bell on Thursday. 3 Medical Stocks to Buy Now   
Why Apple Is Becoming a Major Obstacle to Facebook's Growth
 Last night on   Facebook    's (NASDAQ: FB) third-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg   laid out where the social networking giant's future lies: video,   messaging, and Stories. Messaging in particular is extremely   important to Facebook, as its two primary messaging platforms,   Messenger and WhatsApp, both have well over 1 billion monthly   active users (MAUs). At last count, Messenger had 1.3   billion MAUs while WhatsApp has more than 1.5   billion MAUs.Put another way, two out of Facebook's   four billion-user platforms    are messaging services. Facebook is now tasked with trying to   monetize all those users. Somewhat unexpectedly,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) has emerged as a major obstacle to Facebook's   growth aspirations.  Apple Business Chat (left) vs. Facebook Messenger for     Business (right). Image sources: Apple and Facebook.It's common courtesy to avoid mentioning a rival by name   whenever possible on earnings calls, but Zuck had no qualms   directly naming Apple as Facebook's "biggest competitor" in   the messaging space:We are leading in most countries, but our biggest competitor     by far is iMessage. And in important countries like the U.S.,     where the iPhone is strong, Apple bundles iMessage as the     default texting app and is still ahead. In countries where     there's more competition between iOS and Android like much of     Europe, people tend to prefer our services. Now, it's worth     noting that one of the main reasons people prefer our services     -- especially WhatsApp -- is because of its stronger record on     privacy.Zuck's comment on privacy is a bit hollow considering the   company's recent scandals. Furthermore, despite now publicly   espousing the privacy benefits of encryption, Facebook executives   had reportedly pressured WhatsApp in private to   weaken its encryption    in an effort to strengthen its data collection capabilities. That   clash ultimately culminated in Jan Koum's resignation as WhatsApp   CEO this year. Messenger has   never    been encrypted by default, although it is an option that can be   manually activated. Facebook is also starting to ramp up   ads within Messenger    .In contrast, Apple has positioned itself as a champion of user   privacy in recent years, never missing an opportunity to note   that all iMessage conversations are encrypted. iMessage was   initially launched back in 2012, offering users an integrated   alternative to traditional SMS text messaging that was more   secure, and Apple has made the service into a legitimate platform   in recent years, adding features like payments, stickers, and app   extensions. Apple even   launched Business Chat    last year, directly threatening Facebook's best hopes of   monetizing its messaging services.Even if iMessage and WhatsApp are technically comparable in   terms of encryption and security, Apple has staked much of its   brand on privacy, while Facebook proves time and time again that   it can't be trusted with user data.Facebook has never provided geographical breakdowns of its   Messenger or WhatsApp user bases, although it's widely accepted   that WhatsApp is incredibly popular in many emerging markets.   Zuck's comments are the most direct confirmation yet that neither   of Facebook's messaging services are dominant in the important   U.S. market, where the company enjoys the strongest   monetization.Conversely, that also means you can look at Apple's position   in some geographical smartphone markets to gauge Facebook's   relative strength or weakness in messaging. While Apple is strong   in the U.S., the good news for Facebook is that just about every   other smartphone market on Earth has "more competition between   iOS and Android," so it still has some opportunities in messaging   yet.  10 stocks we like better than Facebook       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Verizon and Google Team Up to Win New Wireless Subscribers
 During the   third quarter of 2018    ,   Verizon    (NYSE: VZ) showed another big year-over-year increase in   equipment sales. That provides evidence that rising smartphone   prices could   lift handset manufacturers    like   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) again, as they have all year. However, Verizon and   Alphabet    's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG)  Google are using the   rising prices to get aggressive with promotions. The strategy   could be a boon for both companies.Verizon's wireless segment equipment sales were up 23% during   the third quarter and are now up 24.4% year to date when compared   with 2017. Much of that is due to higher smartphone pricing, led   by Apple's iPhone X.   This year's models    bring another round of price hikes with them, setting up the   possibility of another year of advancing equipment revenue, if   consumers remain willing to spring for high-end devices.In case swallowing high prices is unpalatable, though, Verizon   is running a buy-one-get-one-free promotion on Google,   Samsung    , and Apple phones. The deal works for new and existing customers   -- though existing customers have to open a new line with the   purchase to qualify. The phones also need to be purchased via an   installment plan. Verizon will credit back the monthly payment on   statements, which should help the company spread out its cost on   the free phone over time.Of the three BOGO offers, Google's is the most aggressive.   Going with Apple means a free iPhone XR -- its cheapest new model   -- or a $750 credit toward another Apple phone. The Samsung deal   is on the Galaxy Note 9, which starts at $999, and comes with a   $999 credit toward a second Note 9.As for the Google Pixel 3 and 3 XL, it's also a   buy-one-get-one at equal or lesser value. Google's new devices   already undercut the competition, though, starting at $799 for   the Pixel 3 and $929 for the 3 XL. Plus, along with the second   free phone, Verizon is also throwing in a free Pixel Stand with   each phone -- a wireless charging dock powered by Google   Assistant that basically turns the phone into a smart-home hub. A   Pixel Stand retails for $79 right now, so that's another $158   value that Google is tossing into Verizon shopping carts.  Image source: Getty Images.The big jump in equipment sales this year has been nice for   Verizon shareholders, but equipment sales are a less profitable   business than wireless subscriptions. Plus, 70% of Verizon's   wireless segment revenue comes from service fees. Offering   free phones is a great way to move the needle there.Changes in service revenue are driven by new customer   acquisitions, fluctuations in average revenue per user, as well   as "churn" -- the rate at which customers leave for greener   pastures. Though the company has had to get   aggressive with its promotions    because of stiff competition from other telecoms, Verizon has   managed decent growth in net subscriber additions this year.   There were 515,000 net wireless additions during the third   quarter.As for Google, the BOGO promotion could be good for its   business as well. The Pixel family of phones is an underdog, as   the smartphone market is currently dominated by Apple and   Samsung. Google is a newcomer, having just brought the   design process in-house    in early 2018.However, while selling hardware would help diversify Google's   advertising-dominated moneymaking model, software is the bigger   opportunity in the long term. At the recent Pixel event that   officially introduced the Pixel 3, the hardware releases took the   backseat as   Google showed off its software    and services prowess using the phones and a new Home Hub as a   canvas.Using a free Pixel (and free Pixel Stands) as a carrot could   help introduce consumers to Google Assistant's artificial   intelligence and all the related capabilities that come with the   Pixel family. The internet search giant thinks its platform will   simplify daily tasks and improve the quality of life of its   users. If it can convince them of that, the hardware shipments   could become a meaningful part of Alphabet's empire, but ad-based   revenue would surely increase, too.This BOGO offer is thus a win-win, especially for Verizon's   arrangement with Google. With the all-important holiday shopping   season drawing near, expect others to get aggressive with deals   as well, to prevent a Pixel upset of the hardware industry.  10 stocks we like better than Verizon     Communications       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

7 Massive Tech Stocks Leading the Way Higher
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsU.S. equities are surging higher thanks to a sharp rebound in large-cap tech stocks. Much of this comeback in the tech space can be placed on the post-earnings move in Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ). But on a technical basis, a rebound was overdue for other tech stocks, with indicators such as the S&P 500's Bullish Percent Index dropping well below the lows seen in February and in early April.The percentage of NYSE stocks above their 50-day moving average also fell back to levels not seen since early 2016. So, by pretty much any measure, it was time for the value hunters to come out in force.And the bulls are returning to an area of the market - mega-cap tech - that they are comfortable with after years of chasing these momentum superstars higher. Here are seven tech stocks that are worth a look right now:One of the kings among tech stocks, Facebook rallied more than 4% and challenged its 20-day moving average, after reporting earnings. The company reported earnings of $1.76 per share, beating estimates by 32 cents, on a 32.9% rise in revenues. Daily active users increased 9% over the previous year, with the company now estimating that more than 2.6 billion people use their family of apps.Analysts at Aegis Capital raised their price target in response, making Facebook stock their top large-cap pick for the next 12 months with potential for 50% upside. The company will next report results on Jan. 29 after the close.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) shares are perking up to challenge their 50-day and 20-day moving averages. This jump in Apple stock is setting the stage for a run at the highs near $235 set in early October. The company recently unveiled a new iPad Pro model with an iPhone X-like full screen design incorporating its FaceID unlocking technology.The company will next report results on Nov. 1 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.79 per share on revenues of $61.4 billion. When the company last reported on July 31, earnings of $2.34 beat estimates by 16 cents per share on a 17.3% rise in revenues.Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) shares are rallying nearly 5% on Wednesday, trying to climb back up and over the 200-day moving average and break the nasty downtrend that's been in play since the beginning of October. The selloff so far has resulted in a loss of roughly 22% from the high set in late August, qualifying for an outright bear market. Analysts at Aegis Capital released a bullish note to clients on Tuesday, saying that history is on the side of shareholders amid expectations of ongoing profit margin expansion.The company will next report results on Jan. 24 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $5.58 per share on revenues of $73.87 billion. When the company last reported on Oct. 25, earnings of $5.75 per share beat estimates by $2.66 per share on a 29.3% rise in revenues.Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) stock has been among the harder hit of the "FAANGs" in recent months. This is especially true after Netflix stock suffered a peak-to-trough decline of nearly 36% from the high set in late June. The fall was the result of ongoing nervousness of production costs and intensifying competitive pressure. But amid the price meltdown, valuations are looking attractive again with RBC analysts recently taking to CNBC to suggest the tech stock could double in the coming year from its current level.The company will next report results on Jan. 15 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of 24 cents per share on revenues of $4.2 billion. When the company last reported on Oct. 16, earnings of 89 cents per share beat estimates by 21 cents on a 34% rise in revenues.Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) shares are enjoying a nice bounce off of their 200-day moving average, setting up a test of the early October high near $115, which would be worth a gain of roughly 7% from here. With the technical bounce, the uptrend Microsoft stock has enjoyed since the summer of 2016 remains intact amid ongoing enthusiasm for its cloud computing business.MSFT will next report results on Jan. 23 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.09 per share on revenues of $32.2 billion. When the company last reported on Oct. 24, earnings of $1.14 per share beat estimates by 18 cents on an 18.5% rise in revenues.Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) stock is popping back up and over its 200-day moving average, rising nearly 40% from the lows seen just a few weeks ago to challenge the highs set in late August. A return to the highs set back in June would result in another gain of nearly 40% from here. Analysts at Aegis Capital recently raised their price target to $41 on improving sales execution and other evidence the company's business fundamentals are improving.TWTR will next report results on Jan. 24 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 15 cents per share on revenues of $843.02 million. When the company last reported on Oct. 25, earnings of 21 cents per share beat estimates by 7 cents on a 28.5% rise in revenues.Shares of Google parent  Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) are rising up off of a test of the late March low near $1,000, setting up a possible test of the falling 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The company had been hit by worries over the possibility that earnings are peaking, growing political pushback from the Trump Administration over allegations of bias and work on a censored version of its search engine for the Chinese marketplace. But as recently noted by RBC analysts, advertising revenue growth remains strong.Alphabet will next report result son Jan. 24 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $11.01 per share on $31.40 billion in revenue. When the company last reported on Oct. 25, earnings of $13.06 beat estimates by $2.65 per share on a 21.5% rise in revenues.As of this writing, William Roth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post 7 Massive Tech Stocks Leading the Way Higher appeared first on InvestorPlace .
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) are down 6% in October - and they were among big tech's best performers for the month. The Nasdaq fell about 11%.  Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) are both down about 10%. Meanwhile for  Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Amazon.Com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) the losses are closer to 20%. Apple shares hung in and are still up nearly 24% on the year as the market opens for business October 31.The reason is no mystery.The whole tech wreck is based on analysts, and investors, switching from a preference for growth to a preference for profit. They want money today, not tomorrow. They want cash in their hands and to heck with the future.Apple gives them that, a 73 cent-per-share quarterly dividend, covered several times over by earnings. Compared to other income producers it's a tiny yield, 1.37%. But it can be enough.Apple is due to report earnings after the market closes November 1. Analysts are expecting $2.79 per share, and hoping for $2.90 , on revenue of $61.57 billion.This would put Apple on track for revenues of $264.03 billion in 2018 . The estimate for 2019 is $281.86 billion in revenue, and that's just a 6.8% growth rate. But it's the steady net income line, an average of $12 billion per quarter going all the way back to 2015, that investors and analysts are looking at.Just because Apple stock has reached that goal of profitability all techs strive for, doesn't meant there's no growth ahead here.iPhone sales have leveled off , but the next-gen iPhones could revitalize the space . But even if iPhone sales remain flat, AAPL has other areas for growth.Last quarter, revenues from Apple's Services sector grew  31% year-over-year , and I believe Services will soon become AAPL's primary growth driver . The Services sector includes Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple Care and iCloud storage among other things.AAPL's second growth driver is the Apple Watch. Apple shipped 4.7 million watches in the second quarter of this year alone, according to IDC, and is now the top wearable company in the world. It has lapped Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) and even overtaken China's Xiaomi (OTCMKTS: XIACY ), with year-over-year growth of 38%.The Apple Watch will, over time, deliver ongoing financial benefits like the iPhone through services revenue. This will include new health services, like fall detection  and the monitoring of blood sugar levels .Rounding it all out, one shouldn't forget the iPads and Mac Pros Apple announced October 30 in Brooklyn .Apple is no longer the growth story it was, but Apple continues to grow, and the bulk of its growth is now coming in the high-margin services sector.Investors can get all this for just 19 times earnings, at a time when the average stock in the S&P 500 is priced at 22 times earnings.Apple, unlike the other FANG stocks, is a good investment in the most conventional terms, the terms the market is imposing now.

However, MAUs in Europe declined 1 million sequentially to 375 million. On a year-over-year basis, the figure increased 11 million. MAUs in the U.S. & Canada grew 3 million on a year-over-year basis and 1 million sequentially.   Private Messaging & Sharing Gain Prominence    Facebook stated that user adoption of its Messenger service and Stories is increasing rapidly. This is due to the growing user preference to share content within smaller groups. The ephemeral feature of Stories is also a significant attraction to these users.    Management observed that almost 100 billion messages are sent on a daily basis using Facebook services, including Messenger, Stories and WhatsApp. On Messenger, more than 10 billion messages are sent between people and businesses on a monthly basis. Further, users share more than 1 billion Stories every day.    The robust growth in private messaging and sharing bodes well for Facebook. However, the company's business model will take some time to catch up with this rapid growth.    Facebook also noted that in the messaging service space, Apple's AAPL  iMessage is its biggest competitor, particularly in the United States where iPhone has significant user base. In other countries, primarily where Android has dominant presence, Facebook's messaging services are gaining traction.    The company believes strong demand for its messaging service, particularly WhatsApp, is due to tightened security features, including end-to-end encryption. WhatsApp doesn't store user messages or keys, anywhere.    Facebook is also focusing on adding user-friendly features like payments to WhatsApp and Messenger. The company is also set to introduce ads in WhatsApp Status in 2019.      The company noted that the connection between WhatsApp business and users is growing rapidly. WhatsApp business currently has more than 3 million accounts. Paid messaging and ads in Stories are two products Facebook is set to release to enhance interaction between users and businesses.   Stories to Eventually Drive Ad growth    Facebook stated that "more than 90 million businesses rely on its pages to reach potential customers for free." Further, 6 million advertisers are active across Facebook, Instagram and other services.    Currently, advertisers reach users on Facebook services through Facebook News Feed and Instagram Feed. Feed ads on Facebook and Instagram drive the majority of the company's revenue growth and are expected to remain so over the next couple of years.    However, due to growing prominence of private messaging and ephemeral sharing, Stories are expected to become a bigger driver in the long haul.    Keeping this in mind, Facebook rolled out ads in Facebook Stories during the quarter. The company also worked on improving the looks of the ads to make them suitable for Stories.    During the quarter, Facebook expanded Marketplace ads to nearly 70 marketers. In Faceboook Watch, the company introduced "a way for advertisers to buy video placements from a selection of the most engaging publishers, choose specific content categories they want their ads to play alongside and pay only for ads that are watched till the end."    Facebook also added tools that help advertisers to see the placement of their ads on audience network, Instant Articles and Watch.    Facebook is also working on finding ways to help advertisers reach Messenger users through sponsored and inbox ads.   Video Initiatives to Boost Community Feeling    Moreover, the company's focus on "community" and "meaningful social interaction" are long-term growth drivers.    The company's initiative to build communities is gaining traction. Marketplace is now used by 800 million people. It has become a well-known place to buy vehicles online. Moreover, Facebook's new job tool has helped people find more than 1 million jobs. The company also helped people raise more than $300 million for charities through fundraisers.    In case of Instagram, the company is focusing on helping users explore their interests. The company is adding new features in the form of IGTV, new shopping experiences and Explorer tab.    Watch on Facebook core app and IGTV on Instagram are two video initiatives that are expected to promulgate "meaningful social interaction" in News Feed on both the platforms. Management believes that the availability of these dedicated video services will not displace social interactions in Feeds, be it on Facebook or Instagram.    However, Facebook stated that these video services are well-behind in terms of competition, primarily from Alphabet's GOOGL  YouTube. Moreover, video services generate less revenue per minute compared with other money generating services.    Further, Facebook is heavily investing in augmented and virtual reality (AR and VR), as well as hardware to foster more community feeling and social interactions. The launch of hardware products like Portal and Oculus Quest are steps toward that direction.   Revenue Details    Advertising revenues soared 33.5% year over year to $13.54 billion. Asia-Pacific and Europe were the strongest regions, growing 37.6% and 34.2%, respectively.    Advertising revenues in the U.S. & Canada and RoW grew 33.3% and 26.1%, respectively.    Mobile ad revenues surged 40% year over year to $12.5 billion, contributing 92% to total ad revenues. Ad impressions served increased 25%, while average price per ad increased 7% from the year-ago quarter. Growth was driven by higher Feed ads on Facebook and Instagram.    Payments and other fees increased 1.1% year over year to $188 million.   Operating Details    In the reported quarter, costs and expenses jumped 52.6% year over year to $7.95 billion. Facebook's employee base surged 45% year over year to 33.6K.    Marketing & sales expenses as percentage of revenues increased 270 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 14%. Marketing & sales expenses jumped 64.8% from the year-ago quarter to $1.93 billion.    General & administrative expenses as percentage of revenues increased 170 bps to 6.9%. General & administrative expenses surged 75.9% to $943 million.    However, research & development expenses as percentage of revenues decreased 50 bps to 19.4%. Research & development expenses increased 29.5% to $2.66 billion.    Although operating income of $5.78 billion grew 12.9% year over year, operating margin contracted 750 bps to 42.1%.   Balance Sheet & Cash Flow    As of Sep 30, 2018, cash & cash equivalents and marketable securities were $41.21 billion compared with $42.31 billion as of Jun 30, 2018.    Capital expenditures were $3.34 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. Free cash flow was $4.2 billion compared with $2.8 billion in the year-ago quarter.    Facebook bought back almost $4.3 billion of its Class A common stock in the reported quarter.   Guidance    For the fourth quarter, Facebook expects revenue growth rate to decelerate mid-to-high single digit percentage compared with third-quarter's growth rate. Higher contribution from product services and geographies that monetize at lower rates are expected to drive impression growth in the quarter. Moreover, data privacy initiatives are expected to hurt pricing growth.    The company is expected to lose some ad impression opportunities due to its focus on growth of Stories on the core Facebook app.    Facebook anticipates full-year 2018 total expenses to grow roughly 50-55% compared with its previous guidance of 50-60%. Capital expenditures are expected to be roughly between $14 billion and $14.5 billion compared with the previous estimate of $15 billion.    Facebook projects total expenses in 2019 to flare up 40-50% compared with the current year. Moreover, capital expenditures are expected to be roughly between $18 billion and $20 billion.

Can Apple Stock Build Its New Empire on Services?
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is not happy being a boutique high-end retailer of smartphones, tablets, laptops and other products including its watches. It knows that the real money is made not on the products, but on the behind-the-scenes services.Telecom companies including Verizon (NYSE: VZ ), AT&T (NYSE: T ), T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS ) in the American market and many others around the globe earn vast subscription fees for wireless voice, data and other services that are delivered in Apple products.And thanks to Apple acquiescing, Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google reaps revenues from Apple's users via Google's mapping, search and other services that are on Apple's products.Apple isn't too happy about all of this revenue missing its coffers. And in fact, its CEO, Tim Cook did a bit of a rant last week while speaking at a European Union (EU) privacy conference in Brussels about companies making a dime on his company's devices. It was pretty choice, as Mr. Cook lambasted companies for harvesting data for advertising and other revenue streams while at the same time not bringing up that Apple is paid fee income for access to its products by those same companies.And more so since Cook is trying to convince the stock market that its services will be the foundation for its new empire of a company. It wants more customers locking themselves into Apple-land for their music and other content as well as for search and other services that would bring needed revenue growth for a company that is seeing slowing expansion in unit sales for its core iPhone products.To get more services revenues, Apple needs a bigger universe of Apple users. And for the past ten years, Apple's iOS operating system remains a very small piece of the mobile pie for handheld devices. Aside from a few blips, it has remained well below 20% of the market. Android is the market, and that's where service revenues are operating. Alphabet and plenty of other companies are cashing in while Apple just sits there.Apple needs a bigger universe with more iPhones, iPads and other devices in the hands of customers. But rather than licensing out its iOS to other companies, Apple keeps to itself. And rather than slicing product costs to drive more unit sales and conversions from Android to iOS, Apple takes the short-term view of raising prices focusing on average sales prices (ASP) over unit sales.Now granted, it has rolled out some newer iPhones that are slightly lower priced than its flagship iPhone X with its four-figure sticker price. And the new iPhone XS, XS Max shipped recently, along with its cheaper XR.But the XR is still a very pricey phone for a cheaper model.And the market for smartphones is slowing down. According to a survey by the privately held HYLA Mobile - which offers exchange and trade-in services as well as recycling for mobile devices - American consumers are holding on to older smartphones longer. Currently, the average hold on a device by customers is running at 2.83 years , which is up 18.41% over just the past two years alone. This means that phone companies including Apple can't rely on upgrades as quickly as they have been.On Thursday after the market close, Apple will release its fiscal-fourth-quarter results. This quarter, much like its third-quarter results, tends to be softer for unit sales and device revenue. It's Apple's fiscal first quarter's holiday sales followed by the second quarter catch-up where the company earns the bulk of its sales.And given my analysis of supply chain and assembly company information, the fourth quarter should be about the same, with the potential for a small gain in unit sales and revenues from its phones and devices.The company did finally wake up and did something to improve its laptops while making some tweaks to some tablet products. And this might help sales in coming quarters. But with tablet and laptop sales being small fractions of iPhone unit sales, it will take a lot more to build up its universe with these product offerings.Services for the third quarter were 17.93% of overall revenue compared to 56.15% for iPhones, with laptops, tablets and other products including watches making up the rest at 25.93%.Services revenue share is up from the same quarter from last year where it was at 16%. And in dollar terms, it increased by 31.41% for the same quarter over quarter. But if you follow the previous quarter, it only improved by 3.9% and that's been as Apple has supposedly been ramping up its efforts to offer and sell more services.The bottom line is that Apple designs aesthetically nice products even though the heavy engineering work is done by its suppliers. And it has a nice base of customers that would be hard-pressed to convert to Android. That makes for some reliability in its services revenues.But reliability isn't a growth story. Apple might make for a good consumer stock if it managed to pay out more than its current dividend of 73 cents for a yield of only 1.3%. And it could easily do that for shareholder value, given the payout ratio of only 26% and its major cash hoard.But if it wants to get the growth narrative going from services, it needs to amp up the numbers of users. This means slashing product prices and licensing its iOS for other makers to build its universe for it to get more services revenues.Neil George is the editor for Profitable Investing and by company policy does not have any current holdings in the securities mentioned above.The post Can Apple Stock Build Its New Empire on Services? appeared first on InvestorPlace .
Qualcomm Earnings May Not Be Strong Enough to Lift the Stock
There isn't much more Qualcomm  can do to increase the company's profits, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The firm's analyst Tal Liani lowered his rating on Qualcomm (QCOM) stock to Neutral from Buy, predicting the technology company will report profits below expectations next year."Our model suggests that management has exhausted most opportunities for P&L restructuring, yet earnings upside is not likely to be sufficient to increase the share price," Liani wrote on Wednesday. "In addition, smartphone demand is softening and we reduce our estimates accordingly."The analyst lowered his price target for Qualcomm stock to $70 from $75. Liani slightly raised his fiscal 2018 and 2019 earnings-per-share estimates to $3.63 and $4.21, respectively, from $3.60 and $4.18, but cut the 2020 EPS estimate to $4.97 from $5.64. The fiscal 2019 EPS estimate of $4.21 is materially lower than the $4.45 FactSet consensus.Qualcomm's stock is down 0.7%, to $62.73 on Wednesday. Its shares have declined about 2% year to date.The analyst also cited the uncertainty surrounding licensing disagreements with two key customers - Huawei and Apple  (AAPL). He had no forecast on when those disputes will be resolved.Liani also said the arrival of fifth-generation wireless technology will take time to benefit the smartphone-chip maker."5G is not expected to be a major driver in the foreseeable future, with meaningful device shipments only starting in 12-18 months," he wrote.Qualcomm is slated to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Nov. 7 after the close.

 Oct 31 (Reuters) - Wearable device maker Fitbit Inc  reported a surprise third-quarter adjusted profit on Wednesday, driven by its fast-growing smartwatch business that contributed to nearly half of its total revenue. Shares of the San Francisco-based company, which has also kept a tight leash on operating costs, jumped nearly 10 percent to $5.19 in after-market trading. Fitbit sold 3.5 million devices in the reported quarter, beating estimates of 3.42 million, according to four analysts polled by FactSet. Average selling price increased 3 percent to $108 per device. Fitbit's smartwatch Versa retails for about $200, while the price of the Apple Watch Series 4, which is capable of taking an electrocardiogram, begins at $399. "Fourteen months ago, we had zero share in the smartwatch category. And today, we are the number 2 player in the U.S.," Fitbit CEO James Park told analysts on a conference call. 
 HEALTHCARE UNIT Fitbit recently made tuck-in acquisitions in the healthcare market as it looks for a more predictable stream of revenue in the backdrop of continued sales declines for its tracker devices.

Fitbit now expects fourth-quarter revenue to be more than $560 million, compared to average analysts' estimate of $569.2 million, according to Refinitiv data. Operating costs were down 17 percent to about $150 million from last year. The company's net loss narrowed to $2.1 million, or 1 cent per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 29, from $113.4 million, or 48 cents per share, a year earlier.  On an adjusted basis, the company earned 4 cents per share. Revenue rose marginally to $393.6 million from $392.5 million. Analysts on average had expected the company to lose 1 cent per share, on revenue of $381.2 million.

 Technology giant Apple AAPL  is set to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 1 after market close. Since Apple accounts for more than 19% of total market capitalization of the entire technology sector in the S&P 500 Index, it is worth taking a look at its fundamentals ahead of its quarterly results.   Inside Our Methodology    Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an  Earnings ESP  of +1.35%. According to our surprise prediction methodology, the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 and a positive Earnings ESP raises the possibility of a beat. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) stock is best avoided going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  .    Apple has seen positive earnings estimate revision of a couple of cents over the past seven days for the fiscal fourth quarter. Analysts raising estimates right before earnings - with the most up-to-date information possible - is a pretty good indicator for the stock. The company also has strong track record of positive earnings surprise. It delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 5.46% in the trailing four quarters. It is expected to post substantial earnings growth of 34.78% and revenue growth of 16.95% in the fiscal fourth quarter. Though AAPL has a solid Growth Score of B, its Value and Momentum Score of C each is disappointing. The stock belongs to a top-ranked Zacks Industry ( top 43%  ).    According to the analysts polled by Zacks, Apple has an average target price of $237.91 with more than half of the analysts having a Strong Buy or a Buy rating ahead of its earnings. This indicates nearly 11.5% upside to the current price of AAPL (read: FAANG ETFs Face Off Amid New Tariffs: Apple Vs. Amazon  ).   What to Watch?    Investors will closely watch sales of the recently released iPhone models and the guidance for the holiday quarter.   ETFs in Focus    Given this, ETFs having the highest allocation to this tech titan will be in focus going into its earnings announcement. While there are several ETFs in the space with Apple in their top 10 holdings, we have highlighted five technology funds that have Apple as their top firm (see: all the Technology ETFs here  ):   Select Sector SPDR Technology ETF XLK   - The fund has AUM of $20.1 billion and has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.

 By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Oct 31 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rebounded for a second day on Wednesday, as investors snapped up beaten-down technology and internet favorites and strong company results lifted spirits after equities had been spooked this month. Shares of Facebook Inc  gained 4.6 percent after the social media giant said margins would stop shrinking after 2019 as costs from scandals ease.  Amazon.com Inc  and Apple Inc, other members of the FAANG group, climbed as well. "Tech is leading the way," said Mike Dowdall, investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management in Chicago. "Growth stocks, broadly, are closing the gap with value a little. They've been underperforming them by a decent amount." "Facebook earnings came in decent yesterday after the market close. That's provided a bit of support for tech overall," Dowdall said. The high-flying group has powered U.S. stock market's    decade-long bull run, but fears of rising borrowing costs, global trade disputes and possible slowdown in U.S. corporate profits have pummeled the stocks recently. General Motors Co  shares jumped 8.7 percent and were on track to post their biggest one-day gain since late May, after the No. 1 U.S. automaker posted robust quarterly results and forecast strong full-year earnings.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 400.03 points, or 1.61 percent, to 25,274.67, the S&P 500  gained 49.42 points, or 1.84 percent, to 2,732.05 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 193.64 points, or 2.7 percent, to 7,355.29. Although the S&P 500 is on track to post its first two-day gains for the month on Wednesday, it is still on track for its worst biggest monthly percentage drop since August 2015. The Nasdaq was on pace for its biggest monthly loss since 2008. Mostly stronger-than-expected results have pushed up third-quarter profit growth estimates for S&P 500 companies to 26.3 percent, according to Refinitiv data. Defensive sectors were the only decliners. The financial sector  rose 2.4 percent and the S&P 500 regional banks index  gained 3.1 percent, on the U.S. Federal Reserve's proposal to ease regulations for banks with less than $700 billion in assets.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.13-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.95-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 10 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 31 new highs and 93 new lows. 
 
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlthough it doesn't seem like it on paper, I consider Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU ) a contentious investment. On one hand, Roku stock represents compelling exposure to the content-streaming revolution. But on the flipside, the cord-cutting phenomenon alone won't send ROKU to the top.After more than a year since its fall 2017 initial public offering, this investment has become more controversial. Early on, I considered Roku stock a speculative buying opportunity despite the obvious IPO risk. This was a time when highly-anticipated debuts, such as Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN ) and Snap (NYSE: SNAP ), severely disappointed.For some perspective, Blue Apron shares are firmly in the dollar menu, while SNAP isn't too far behind. ROKU was crazy-risky, but ultimately, that risk paid off.In my view, the company differed from other tragic IPOs in that its underlying industry is incredibly viable. Cord-cutting has become more intensive, pressuring traditional media companies like Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ). Thus, despite Roku's diminutive size, the ROKU stock price had the potential to jump on the streaming sector's strengths.But when shares went bonkers in November of last year, investors had to reconsider the value proposition . The argument I made at the time was this: "At $20, ROKU stock was intriguing. At $40, I'm taking my profits and running for the door."I had every reason to voice doubts. While Roku stock had an impressive debut, that performance also raised competitors' eyebrows. We're not talking about run of the mill rivals, either. Instead, they are names like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ).This past August, I doubled down on my overvaluation concerns . The Roku stock price, again, had made a surging run. However, I didn't like what investors received for the added premium. And despite the October fallout, I'm still hesitant.In the streaming company's last earnings report for the second quarter 2018, its robust print skyrocketed Roku stock. Management delivered exactly what it needed to: a revenue beat , double-digit subscriber growth and increased product engagement.At first glance, almost every fundamental factor - except for the fierce competition - favored ROKU. Wall Street anticipated revenue of $141.5 million, but it came in at nearly $157 million. Monthly active users (MAUs) grew to 22 million, up 46% against Q2 2017.That all sounded great, but the details revealed increasingly worrying signs.For starters, on a sequential basis, MAU growth fell to fresh lows. Since Q4 2016, active subscriber growth averages 10%. But in the last quarter, this metric fell to 5.8%, representing three consecutive quarters of declines.More critically, revenue generated by each MAU has also moved in the wrong direction. At its peak in Q4 2016, ROKU rang up $147.3 million against 13.4 million MAUs. That translates to each active sub generating $11 in sales. However, in the most recent quarter, this user output dropped to $7.13.So while, on a nominal basis, the user stats appear impressive, investors are increasingly paying more for the privilege. That's not something that you want to see from a smaller company fighting against well-capitalized competition.Further, revenue per MAU has been stuck inside a bearish trend channel since Q4 2016.  Subsequent quarters produced comparatively ho-hum results until Q4 2017. That's when the company managed $9.76 per MAU. However, the following two quarters failed to capitalize on that momentum.By the time the Roku stock price approached $78, I believe astute investors had enough. As a growth company, ROKU had to grow. When key metrics demonstrated a slowing in demand, they headed for the door.On the flipside, the Roku stock price dropped 31% since the October opener. Plus, the industry's fundamentals haven't changed. Streaming is the new face of personal entertainment.I also love the product. With a one-time equipment purchase , ROKU subs enjoy access to various content, including Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Hulu. Additionally, the user experience is scalable. You decide what you want or don't want - and pay accordingly.But like I said earlier this year, at $40, Roku stock becomes a complicated proposition. That hasn't changed for the better at this point. In fact, with more financials to analyze, it's becoming apparent that the company's growth engine has weaknesses.Does that mean you can't advantage the current discount? My gut feeling tells me to wait. I believe ROKU has more correcting to do before it becomes interesting again.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post Roku Stock Is Down Big, but It's Still a Risky Trade appeared first on InvestorPlace .

Will Apple’s New MacBook Air Be A Giant Flop?
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOct. 30 was a big day for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). The company held a special event where it announced long-awaited updates for two of its most beloved Mac computers, including a new MacBook Air. It also unveiled new iPad Pros billed as the biggest upgrade since the prosumer tablets were first introduced. And the company released new versions of many of its operating systems, with new, high profile features. This should have been the Apple equivalent of hitting it out of the park.Instead, the positive buzz has been tempered by a lot of head scratching, griping and even bricked devices.But at least Apple stock got a small boost.The new MacBook Air was one of the most highly anticipated releases of the year. A large contingent of Apple laptop users (myself included) have been nursing MacBook Airs with low resolution screens and hopelessly outdated processors for two reasons: they don't have the Butterfly keyboard that has proven so problematic in other Apple notebooks , and they still have USB-A ports.At yesterday's event , AAPL took the wraps off a new MacBook Air that finally gets a high resolution Retina display, along with new 8th generation Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Core processors. That was great news.However, the existing, tried and true keyboard was replaced with the Butterfly version, and all legacy ports were ditched altogether in favor of USB-C. The company didn't leave a single USB-A port. Most existing accessories, including thumb drives, require an adapter, dongle or hub to connect to the new MacBook Air. And the new MacBook Air further confuses Apple's laptop lineup. As Engadget points out, there are now three Mac laptops priced within $100 of each other , and they overlap with each other in many respects.The New iPad Pros look like killer tablets, and boast impressive specs. They also added USB-C support and the new Apple Pencil 2 stylus attaches magnetically and automatically charges via induction. All very cool. But some deeper digging revealed a few burns. Current iPad Pro owners won't be able to use their existing Apple Pencil if they upgrade, instead they'll have to fork out an additional $129 for a new Apple Pencil 2. And they also won't be able to use that new Apple Pencil 2 with previous generation iPad Pros.While adding USB-C support is a move that many users had been hoping for, the new iPad Pro killed Apple's Lightning port. And some iPad Pro owners are now realizing that means Lightning accessories they've invested in can't be used with the new models.It's not unreasonable for a company to raise prices when it releases new products. If nothing else, inflation has to be accounted for. But AAPL is taking some heat for significantly raising prices on the products it announced yesterday. The new MacBook Air sees its starting price rise from $999 to $1,199. The new Mac Mini increases from $499 to $799. The $99 Apple Pencil goes to $129 for the Apple Pencil 2. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro started at $649, but the new 11-inch iPad Pro starts at $799.With last year's iPhone X, Apple significantly hiked the price of its flagship smartphone. Doing so raised the average sale price (ASP) , which more than offset slowing unit sales volume and helped Apple stock to continue chugging along. It appears that the company is using a similar pricing tactic with the new products it announced yesterday. Doing so does have some risk, especially since it now lacks a laptop under $1,000, which could impact sales to students and price-conscious shoppers.In addition to new hardware announcements, Apple rolled out new versions of many of its device operating systems yesterday. Unfortunately, watchOS 5.1 ended up bricking some brand new Apple Watch Series 4 smartwatches. Apple had to pull the update and affected users will apparently need to visit an Apple Store for service.Apple made many Mac and iPad fans very happy yesterday. But it also made big moves that could cause a backlash among its core users. And the degree to which prices were increased for new products is raising eyebrows, and could lead to further erosion among Mac sales. Overall, what should have been a great day for AAPL and Apple fans was tempered by grumbling, with a botched system update hitting the new (and significantly more expensive) Apple Watch Series 4 being the icing on the cake.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s.The post Will Apple's New MacBook Air Be A Giant Flop? appeared first on InvestorPlace .
 By Shreyashi   Sanyal Oct 31 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose for a second day on Wednesday, as investors snapped up beaten-down technology favorites and strong results for General Motors and a host of other companies lifted spirits at the end of a torrid month for global equities. Shares of Facebook Inc  gained 3.7 percent after the social media giant said margins would stop shrinking after 2019 as costs from scandals ease.

Shares of Apple AAPL gained only 0.5% on Oct 30, reacting in a lukewarm manner to its grand product-launch event. But this is no way detracts from the major gains it has notched up over the last year. The stock has gained nearly 28% over this period and has notched up a similar increase year to date.Further, Apple's market cap recently hit the $1 trillion mark. The question now remains whether the software giant can counter slowing iPhone sales with revenues from other areas.In any case, it would be difficult to ignore the world's most valuable company as it prepares to report earnings on Nov 1. This is the last FAANG stock to post results for the third-quarter earnings season. Facebook FB , Amazon AMZN , Alphabet GOOGL and Netflix NFLX have already reported earnings numbers.Higher Average Selling Price Counters iPhone Sales SlideApple reported fiscal third-quarter earnings on Jul 31, 2018. This turned out be its best June quarter ever and the fourth-straight quarter of double-digit increase in revenues. Nearly 64% of its total revenue comes from the iPhone and the flagship product lines' sales have been slipping over the last few years.This year iPhone unit sales have grown by single digits. Sales increased 1% year over year in the third quarter but came in under analyst expectations. Apple has countered this phenomenon by focusing on selling more expensive models. Consequently, average selling price rose 19% from the year-ago quarter. Fresh Mac Line Up to Combat Sales SlideAccording to figures released by Gartner earlier this month, worldwide Mac shipments declined in the third quarter of 2018. Per these estimates, Apple shipped around 4.9 million units, 8.5% lower than the year-ago quarter. Market share also slipped from 8% in the year-ago quarter to 7.3%.This situation is likely to be remedied by the new line up of devices released on Oct 30. At the launch event at Cupertino, Apple unveiled a new MacBook Air, an upgraded Mac mini and a larger iPad Pro. Incidentally, Apple has raised prices of the MacBook Air and the iPad pro by around 20% and 25%, respectively.New iPhones Crucial for SuccessThe latest iPhone lineup was launched only at the end of the last quarter. But investors will still be looking for indications about the sales prospects of the iPhone XS, XS Max and the XR. Nearly 56% of Apple's revenues came from iPhones in the last quarter.The prospects of wearables, such as the new Apple watch will also be closely watched. Investors will also be looking for clues about whether Apple can achieve its goal of boosting service revenues to $51 billion by 2020. Since the figure already hit $35.7 billion in the last quarter, Apple appears to be on track.Earnings Beat on the CardsApple, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.35%.

 By Jennifer Saba (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.) NEW YORK, Oct 31 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Facebook's  next phase could be frightful, if Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg is to be believed. He was more candid during a call with analysts on Tuesday than he has been in the past about the problems enveloping the social network. Investors now see the existential questions, but not yet any answers. For a company whose shares have fallen nearly a third since July, the clarity from Zuckerberg on Tuesday over Facebook's three main priorities is a welcome change. For starters, he admitted that Facebook's main money machine, News Feed, is losing relevance as consumers shift to stories and private messaging. That is a direct shot at Snapchat and its self-erasing content, something Facebook has attempted to adapt for its own site. That's working fine for picture-sharing app Instagram but it's not taking off as quickly as Zuckerberg hoped for Facebook. Even Snap  is unprofitable. Second, Zuckerberg took a sling at Apple'sTim Cook, who earlier this month called for tighter restrictions on data that would directly crimp Facebook and Alphabet's  Google. Messaging is a big initiative at Facebook, but the company claims Apple's bundling of its own iMessage service with the iPhone gives it an advantage. The friction between the two suggests a new phase in a potentially mutually damaging war between the world's biggest tech companies. Lastly there's the revenue problem. Even if Facebook's more "private" communities, such as messaging app WhatsApp, take firmer hold, squeezing money from them will be difficult. People don't want their private group conversations interrupted by ads. And video advertising, where Facebook is far behind Alphabet's YouTube, doesn't pull in the kind of revenue that News Feed does. Seeing the monster in plain sight is progress, and for that the Facebook boss deserves credit. Slaying it is a totally different challenge. What Zuckerberg hasn't yet disclosed is whether he's up to that job. 
On Twitter
 
 CONTEXT NEWS - Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told investors during a third-quarter earnings call on Oct. 30 that the social network will focus on messaging, video advertising and disappearing stories. He warned that "it will take some time for our business to catch up to our community growth." - Zuckerberg also stated that smartphone maker Apple has an advantage in offering messaging services to customers, because it bundles its own iMessage product with the iPhone. - Facebook reported third-quarter earnings of $5.1 billion, compared with $4.7 billion in the same period last year. Revenue increased 33 percent while costs grew by 53 percent. 
 
Is iShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target ETF (CRBN) a Hot ETF Right Now?
 The iShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target ETF (CRBN) was launched on 12/08/2014, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the World ETFs category of the market. What Are Smart Beta ETFs? Products that are based on market cap weighted indexes, which are strategies designed to reflect a specific market segment or the market as a whole, have traditionally dominated the ETF industry.Market cap weighted indexes work great for investors who believe in market efficiency. They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.There are some investors, though, who think it's possible to beat the market with great stock selection; this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta, which track non-cap weighted strategies.These indexes attempt to select stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance, based on certain fundamental characteristics or a combination of such characteristics.Even though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results. Fund Sponsor & Index The fund is managed by Blackrock. CRBN has been able to amass assets over $508.48 M, making it one of the larger ETFs in the World ETFs. Before fees and expenses, CRBN seeks to match the performance of the MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target Index.The MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target Index is designed to address two dimensions of carbon exposure ? carbon emissions and potential carbon emissions from fossil fuel reserves. Cost & Other Expenses Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.With one of the least expensive products in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.20%.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.32%. Sector Exposure and Top Holdings Most ETFs are very transparent products, and disclose their holdings on a daily basis. ETFs also offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, though it's still important for investors to research a fund's holdings.When you look at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 2.59% of the fund's total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon Com Inc (AMZN).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 11.46% of CRBN's total assets under management. Performance and Risk The ETF has lost about -5.00% so far this year and is down about -1.61% in the last one year (as of 10/31/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $108.03 and $125.90.CRBN has a beta of 0.98 and standard deviation of 11.96% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a low risk choice in the space. With about 1243 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk. Alternatives IShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the World ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF (SUSA) tracks MSCI USA ESG Select Index and the iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF (DSI) tracks MSCI KLD 400 Social Index. IShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF has $741.15 M in assets, iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF has $1.15 B. SUSA has an expense ratio of 0.25% and DSI charges 0.25%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the World ETFs.

Fitbit Stock Won’t Get Much Lift From Likely Q3 Beat
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFitbit (NYSE: FIT ) will probably beat analysts' consensus expectations when the company unveils its third-quarter results on Oct. 31 after the market closes. And the company is likely to report progress on multiple fronts. However, Fitbit stock probably won't get a huge bounce in the wake of the results, amid continued concerns about the impact of the trade conflict between the U.S. and China.While those concerns will probably keep a lid on Fitbit stock in the near term, FIT stock is likely to rally strongly over the longer term.In the second quarter, Fitbit's new smartwatch, the Versa, appeared to have been more popular than the company had predicted. On its Q2 conference call in August, FIT noted that the Versa had "outsold all Samsung , Garmin  and Fossil  smartwatches in North America combined" during the quarter. The company reported that demand for the product had outpaced supply, strongly  suggesting that Fitbit had not baked such huge sales of the device into its guidance.But despite the apparent positive surprise, Fitbit did not raise its 2018 revenue guidance of "roughly $1.5 billion." Although Fitbit CEO James Park showed more optimism by tweeting that , "we expect … to return to growth and profitability in the second half of the year," analysts' estimates were probably based only on the official  guidance.Consequently, there is a great chance that Fitbit's Q3 results will beat analysts' expectations.Earlier this month, Fitbit released a new tracker, the Charge 3.The device has multiple, significant improvements over its predecessor, and it got solid, if not glowing reviews.  The Verge, for example , lauded its "great design," "more than a week of battery life," and "reliable automatic workout tracking."  Also on the tracker front, Fitbit stated during its Q2 conference call that, "we also believe the channel reduction of trackers has run its course" and said it was confident that sales of its trackers had bottomed in Q2.Furthermore, the company noted that it had introduced "a number of key health apps" in Q2, including a blood glucose reader, while more than 2.9 million people had signed up for its female health tracking feature. Those new health apps and the popularity of the female health tracker may have spurred sales of many more devices last quarter.Additionally, the company indicated that it would take steps to sell new diagnostics and coaching services to owners of Fitbit devices. While progress on that front probably won't yet be material to the company's results, it could make owners of Fitbit stock and the Street more upbeat about the company's outlook.Finally in Q2, Fitbit's revenue from its Asia Pacific region jumped 66% year-over-year to $35 million. If the company's products continued gaining traction in Asia, the region could meaningfully boost the company's results.Although Fitbit's products have -  as of last month  - been spared from U.S. tariffs.But that situation may not continue, as Bloomberg reported yesterday that the U.S. may place tariffs on all U.S. goods if progress is not made on solving the trade conflict next month . As I mentioned earlier, investors' concerns about that issue will probably prevent Fitbit stock from spiking very much even if it delivers beat-and-raise Q3 results on Wednesday.At current levels, the enterprise value per revenue of Fitbit stock is a tiny 0.4. If the company is indeed able to return to growth and profitability, that valuation is exceptionally attractive.And importantly, Fitbit's smartwatches have been able to maintain important advantages over Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) smartwatches. Specifically, Fitbit's watches remain meaningfully cheaper, have much longer battery lives, interface more effectively with Android devices, and measure more important aspects of people's health than Apple watches.Assuming that Fitbit is able to return to growth and profitability, as its CEO said it would and the valuation of Fitbit stock is very low. Moreover, FIT stock has multiple, upcoming  potential positive trends, and its smartwatches retain important competitive advantages over Apple Watches.While worries about tariffs will likely keep FIT stock from advancing very much in the short term, over the next two years, Fitbit stock should at least triple from current levels.As of this writing, the author owned shares of FIT stock.The post Fitbit Stock Won't Get Much Lift From Likely Q3 Beat appeared first on InvestorPlace .

Strong earnings reports from companies including General Motors Co, Yum Brands Inc  and Estee Lauder Cos Inc, all of which have a fair share of exposure to China, also boosted sentiment. "Some continuation of yesterday's strength with pretty good results in the last hour, so this momentum is expected to continue today," said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. "There is more comfort right now at least and less anxiety since we're finishing out the month." The FANG group and Apple Inc  have led the slide on Wall Street this month, which has left the S&P 500 and Dow Industrials with barely any gains for the year, fanned by concerns over trade, higher borrowing and wage costs, fears of corporate earnings peaking and a host of geopolitical worries. The S&P has not posted gains for two sessions in a row so far in October, during which the index has tumbled nearly 8 percent, set for its biggest monthly drop in over eight years. At 8:54 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis  were up 231 points, or 0.93 percent. S&P 500 e-minis  were up 27.75 points, or 1.03 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis  were up 104.5 points, or 1.53 percent. The ADP national employment report showed private payrolls increased by 227,000 this month, the highest rise since February. It comes ahead of the more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report on Friday.  But, data also showed U.S. labor costs accelerated in the third quarter as wages for both private and government workers surged amid tightening labor market conditions.  General Motors jumped 6.4 percent after the carmaker's robust quarterly results and forecast.  Yum Brands was up 3.3 percent and Yum China Holdings Inc  rose 7.2 percent as strong KFC sales drove results. Estee Lauder gained 7.1 percent after the cosmetics maker said higher demand in Asia boosted quarterly results and higher full-year profit outlook.  But, Kellogg Co  fell 5.2 percent after cutting its full-year profit outlook due to higher advertising and distribution costs.

Britain's FTSE hits three-week high after torrid October
 FRANKFURT, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Dialog Semiconductor  posted forecast-beating third-quarter results on Wednesday and gave an upbeat view for the year, even as Korean electronics giant Samsung Electronics  cautioned that a two-year memory chip boom is over. Shares in the Anglo-German chip designer rose by 9 percent, building on gains made on the back of a $600 million deal with Apple  that was announced after the quarter closed.  Dialog has agreed to transfer people and patents to Apple that are key to making the power-management chips at the heart of the iPhone. It will brief investors on its strategy as a smaller, but more diversified, business in London on Thursday. Dialog would build its expertise in mixed-signal mobile power applications, Bagherli added, and focus on high-growth segments of the Internet of Things, mobile, automotive and computing and storage markets. Semiconductor stocks have been hit hard in October by mounting evidence that a turning business cycle and escalating trade tensions will bring an end to a global boom that propelled Samsung to record quarterly profits.  The South Korean electronics giant has called a downturn in the memory chip market. Dialog's fate is more closely tied to that of Apple, which is expected to account for three-quarters of revenues this year. Dialog said third-quarter revenues rose 6 percent to $384 million, while underlying operating profits were up 9 percent to $83.7 million, ahead of mean expectations in a poll of analysts.  It forecast fourth-quarter revenues in the range of $430-$470 million, while full-year revenues were seen up 8 percent. Analysts at Baader Helvea described the results as solid and said the outlook was above consensus. Dialog also said it would launch a buyback of 100-150 million euros of its stock. At an assumed average price of 21 euros a share that would out at 7.1 million shares, the firm said. 
 
 OSAKA, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Japanese electronics component firm Murata Manufacturing Co Ltd  raised its full-year profit outlook citing solid sales of components for new smartphone models, despite some market concerns of an industry slowdown. Murata said it sees operating income for the full year through March rising 68 percent from the previous year to 275 billion yen ($2.43 billion), compared with a previous forecast of 240 billion yen. That also beat the market consensus of 269 billion yen, based on 22 analysts' forecasts according to Refinitiv data. The supplier to Apple Inc  and other smartphone makers is the world's biggest provider of multi-layer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) — tiny parts that control the flow of electricity in a variety of products such as smartphones.

 By John Revill ZURICH, Oct 31 (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank on Wednesday reported a 12.94 billion Swiss franc ($12.88 billion) third-quarter loss as the Swiss franc's recent rise, triggered by trade war fears and concern over Italy, cut the value of foreign currency holdings. The central bank made a 10.51 billion franc loss on its foreign currency investments, which stand at 753 billion francs, while its gold reserves registered a valuation loss of 2.79 billion francs. The SNB has built up a large haul of foreign currency investments during its campaign to weaken the Swiss franc, which the bank continues to describe as "highly-valued." Escalation in the U.S.-Chinese trade conflict and uncertainty about the Italian government's budget increased upward pressure on the safe-haven franc during the third quarter. The currency gained 1.6 percent against the dollar and nearly 2 percent against the euro during the quarter. The SNB has 36 percent of its foreign exchange reserves in the dollar, and 39 percent in the euro, according to data released on Wednesday. The franc's appreciation lowered the value of the U.S.- and euro-denominated bonds and stocks the SNB holds, as well as the interest income and dividends from them when converted to francs. The SNB holds 20 percent of its investments in equities, with stakes in companies including Starbucks, Facebook  and Apple.  It holds 68 percent of its reserves in government bonds and 12 percent in other bonds. Making a profit is not part of the SNB's mandate. Instead the central bank targets price stability, which it defines as keeping annual price rises under 2 percent. Still, the loss is unlikely to hurt the SNB's ability to pay a dividend to the Swiss government and the country's 26 cantons - or states.  That is because the SNB has a distribution reserve of 67.3 billion francs after it posted its biggest profit it its 110-year history last year.  "The SNB will probably post a loss this year because of the franc's appreciation and the rise in interest rates which pushes down the value of its bond portfolio," said Alessandro Bee, an economist at UBS. "But they will still be able to make a payout because of the big profit they made last year."

 By Ju-min Park and Heekyong Yang SEOUL, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  slashed 2018 capex by more than a quarter on Wednesday and warned of lower profit until early next year, calling an end to a two-year boom in memory chips that fuelled record third-quarter profit. The downbeat forecast by the world's biggest maker of memory chips and smartphones adds to investor jitters over waning global demand for mobile and other electronics devices that roiled world stock markets this month. "Looking further ahead to 2019, earnings are forecast to be weak for the first quarter due to seasonality, but then strengthen as business conditions, particularly in the memory market, improve," Samsung said in a statement. Analysts said the capex cut should ease concerns over further supply growth and price declines, as prices of some memory chips have already fallen to over two-year lows and rivals are set to start new production lines next year. Samsung, one of the industry's biggest buyers of chip-manufacturing tools, said its capital spending this year would drop by 27 percent to 31.8 trillion won ($28 billion) from a record 43.4 trillion won last year. "NAND (flash memory) chip prices will further decline through the first half of next year ... (as) Toshiba's   new production line will start and Hynix  starts mass production of one of its NAND lines," said Song Myung-sup, an analyst at HI Investment & Securities. "Oversupply is expected to continue." Samsung, however, sought to assuage investor concerns of a steep downturn in the chip market, citing solid demand from servers as cloud-based data services grow fast. A Samsung executive said the company believed it was at the "start of a virtuous up-cycle" in chip sales to the server industry. "Temporary price changes can repeat but fundamentally we have a very strong demand base for memory," Chun Sewon, senior vice president of Samsung's memory marketing, told analysts. Samsung also said it was considering converting some of its NAND production lines to make DRAM chips next year, rather than add capacity amid a glut of NAND flash chips. 
 SOFT LANDING Samsung reported a record 17.6 trillion won operating profit in the July-September quarter, in line with the company's estimate.  With chip prices weakening after years of stellar growth, analysts expect Samsung's fourth-quarter profit will decline by 4 percent from the third quarter's record, according to Refinitiv data. That will be still up 11 percent from a year ago, helped by efficiency improvements and cost-cutting in the chip business, which accounts for nearly four-fifths of Samsung's operating profit. "Since Samsung continues to reduce the costs of (semiconductors), it is not very likely to witness a so-called hard-landing situation," said Avril Wu, senior research director at DRAMeXchange. Higher server demand would help the memory chip market regain stability after the first quarter of next year, Samsung said, chiming with the outlook given by South Korean peer SK Hynix last week.  Samsung's semiconductor business booked a 37 percent rise in operating profit to 13.7 trillion won, while the mobile business posted a 33 percent fall to 2.2 trillion won. Squeezed by competition with Apple Inc  in the premium segment and with Chinese rivals in other segments, Samsung's smartphone business saw profit fall to the lowest level since the first quarter of 2017. It plans to share details of its development of foldable smartphones at a conference early next month, hoping the model will help revive its premium cache. Samsung said third-quarter revenue rose 5.5 percent to 65.5 trillion won, slightly ahead of its guidance. Shares in Samsung, which has $265 billion in market value, fell 1.2 percent. The stock has fallen 16 percent so far this year. ($1 = 1,139.1000 won)

 By Cate Cadell and Jane Lanhee Lee BEIJING/SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Chinese search engine operator Baidu Inc  on Wednesday forecast fourth-quarter sales below analyst estimates, saying new regulations and uncertainty surrounding a Sino-U.S. trade spat has prompted clients to cut back on advertising. U.S.-listed Baidu, often compared to Alphabet Inc'sGoogle, also reported a sharp decline in its operating profit margin in the third quarter, as the firm invests heavily in autonomous driving and artificial intelligence (AI). At the same time, ongoing tit-for-tat import tariffs between the United States and China has created economic uncertainty. Baidu said it expects advertising in areas such as real estate, finance and e-commerce to be negatively affected.  The firm "began to feel the impact of policy changes... as well as general uncertainties from a potential trade war," Chief Financial Officer Herman Yu said on an earnings call with analysts. "We expect this trend to continue." Baidu also expects revenue impact from an ongoing cleanup of illegal medical advertising, which emerged in 2016 and which led to regulation that slashed the number of eligible advertisers. Subsequent restructuring has seen Baidu sell cash-burning units. The firm expects October-December revenue of 25.48 billion to 26.72 billion yuan, versus 23.6 billion yuan in the same period a year prior. The forecast compared with the 27.6 billion yuan average of 17 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv. Baidu shares were down 1.4 percent in after-hours trade. The stock has fallen more than 20 percent since the start of the year, amid a broader sell-off of Chinese technology shares. "In general there will be some challenges, in particular in the internet gaming sector, that will impact ad spending," said senior analyst Raymond Feng at Pacific Epoch. "[But] advertising momentum for Baidu's news feed will continue and that creates more time for investors to wait for the next developments on AI and autonomous driving," he said. Baidu's investors were shaken earlier this year after Alphabet Inc  said it planned to re-launch its Google search engine in China almost seven years after leaving the market in protest over censorship.  Asked about Google's possible entry, Baidu Chief Executive Officer Robin Li on Wednesday said, "I don't think a non-China-based company has that kind of competence to compete." Though Baidu's fourth-quarter forecast is below estimates, its revenue in the third quarter of 28.2 billion yuan beat estimates by 2.4 percent. Li attributed the performance to improvements in its search platform and news feed using AI. Baidu is one of China's biggest names in AI, and this month became the first Chinese firm to join an AI ethics group alongside members such as Google and Apple Inc. Net income rose 56 percent in July-September, also slightly above estimates, though operating margin fell to 16 percent from 21 percent. Excluding gains from divesting its financial services business, Baidu posted adjusted earnings per share of 19.01 yuan versus the 16.70 yuan analyst estimate. Li said the impact of new regulation and trade fears could extend beyond 2018, but that, in the long term, "I'm still very optimistic about the future of Baidu and the future of China."

 There has been no end to the theories and rumors regarding   Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL) entry into the highly competitive streaming   video market. The move will put the company in competition with   established players like   Netflix    (NASDAQ: NFLX) ,   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Hulu. A number of reports have suggested that   Apple budgeted more than $1 billion in 2018 to develop original   content, and there have been corresponding reports of   high-profile deals    with elite Hollywood talent, confirming its spending spree.More recent stories have indicated that Apple would provide   movies and television series for   free to owners of Apple devices    and offer subscriptions to other steaming providers like HBO,   Showtime, and Starz -- all within the TV app found on the iPhone,   iPad, and Apple TV.An intriguing tale has emerged that Apple is planning to   launch a global streaming service that could compete with Netflix   and Amazon Prime Video as early as next year.  Image source: Apple.Apple plans to debut its streaming service in the U.S. during   the first half of 2019, and will roll the service out globally in   the months that follow,   according to a recent report    in The Information (subscription required). Citing "three people   familiar with the company's plans", the report said that Apple   will bring the nascent streaming service to 100 countries,   putting the company in direct competition with Netflix and Amazon   Prime Video, which are both widely available across the   globe.Amazon Prime Video is said to be available in about 200   countries, while Netflix can be streamed in more than 190. This   reality leaves Apple playing catch-up in a market that is   dominated by the incumbents. Netflix, for example, has a head   start of more than a decade in terms of technology and   penetration, so Apple finds itself at a decided disadvantage.This latest report corroborates earlier suspicions that Apple   would offer subscriptions to other services via its app, similar   to a strategy that Amazon has employed called Amazon Channels.   Prime customers can sign up for the likes of HBO, Starz, and   Showtime as well as specialty services like BritBox, Cheddar, and   Mubi.Currently, Apple offers subscribers a way to watch many of   their favorite shows, including programs from some linear TV   channels like ABC and NBC. It seems Apple wants to become a   one-stop shop for viewers, also providing access to its own   original content and that of other streaming services like   HBO and Netflix. This approach would help to differentiate the   service from some of its existing competitors.Aside from Apple's original programming, the channels offered   would differ by region, due to existing agreements in each   country. As an example, HBO is available via Amazon Channels in   the U.S., but HBO has licensed some of its content to providers   in other countries, which prohibits its inclusion in some foreign   locales. Apple's international streaming efforts might encounter   similar challenges.Apple hasn't been shy about laying out large sums to secure   programming that it hopes will be "must-see TV." The company has   signed deals with Sesame Workshop -- creators of   Sesame Street     -- as well as media maven Oprah Winfrey to create new   content. Apple also has projects involving such well-known   names as M. Night Shyamalan, Jennifer Aniston, and Reese   Witherspoon, and has tapped J.J. Abrams and Sara Bareilles to   helm a show.The company may be at a decided disadvantage, however, when it   comes to platforms. Existing services like Netflix and Amazon are   platform agnostic, and can be accessed on any number of existing   smart televisions, Blu-ray players, or gaming consoles. If   Apple's service is available only on its devices, that could   limit the potential audience for its upcoming service. Apple   controls just 15% of the global smartphone market and about 28%   of the streaming device market in the U.S. -- leaving much of the   market out of its reach.  Image source: Getty Images.Apple's reported streaming service is still months away and we   don't yet know how the offering will play out. Apple has yet to   confirm any of its plans, but the company has a track record of   coming in and disrupting existing markets, so a threat from Apple   can't be ignored. However, based on what's been reported, Netflix   and Amazon don't have anything to worry about -- at least not   yet.  10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The market has been unforgiving of companies that miss consensus expectations, with negative surprises on the guidance front particularly producing major stock market reactions. We saw this companies like Caterpillar (CAT), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and many others. Weak guidance feeds into the market's worries about consensus expectations for the coming quarters that remain at risk of downward revisions given economic weakness in emerging economies and Europe, the impact of trade tariffs and the strong U.S. dollar. Including all of this morning's releases, we now have Q3 results from 279 S&P 500 members or 55.8% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +22.3% from the same period last year on +8.4% higher revenues, with 76.7% beating EPS estimates and 59.9% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of these 279 companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 50.5%.While overall Q3 results are about in-line with historical periods, trends on the revenue front are on the weak side, as the charts below show.You can see in the chart above that companies are finding it difficult to beat revenue estimates. In fact, the proportion of positive revenue surprises is the lowest since 2016 Q4.For more details about the Q3 earnings season and the overall earnings picture, please check our weekly Earnings Preview report   >>>>   The Market's Exaggerated Earnings WorriesThe Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All

Following Apple's Latest Product Unveiling, Here's What to Watch for With Earnings
  Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) has now wrapped up its two fall product events,   and the company's overall lineup heading into the holiday   shopping season looks incredibly strong. The   refreshed MacBook Air    promises to be a key volume driver, as that notebook has long   been one of Apple's most popular models. The redesigned Apple   Watch Series 4 that launched last month and the new iPad Pros   will also likely be hot gifts.Amid the flurry of product news, the Mac maker is preparing to   report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after market close on   Thursday. Here's the what investors should look for.  The new MacBook Air. Image source: Apple.The fiscal fourth quarter is seasonally slow for Apple, in   part because most consumers have now become accustomed to the   company releasing new products in the fall, delaying purchasing   decisions. This year, the iPhone XS and XS Max launched with   just about a week left in the fiscal year, which ended on   Sept. 29, 2018.The iPhone XR, which is priced to better appeal to mainstream   consumers and expected to   drive more unit volumes    , didn't launch until this month -- after the fiscal year had   already closed.  iPhone XR launched last week. Image source: Apple.That's why the fiscal fourth-quarter results will be   relatively uneventful, at least around the core iPhone business.   Instead, investors should continue focusing on Apple's services   business, which is largely unaffected by seasonal factors.   Apple's services business has been adding around 30 million paid   subscriptions every quarter like clockwork over the past three   quarters, a rate that is accelerating over time.  Data source: Apple. Chart by author. Fiscal quarters     shown.For what it's worth, Apple's guidance issued in July   calls for revenue of $60 billion to $62 billion, representing 16%   growth at the midpoint. That would be the   fifth consecutive quarter    of double-digit revenue growth.The most important thing for investors to home in on will be   guidance for the fiscal first quarter, as that forecast will   factor in the full impact of all of the new gadgets it has   unveiled over the past couple of months. After a couple years   challenging the law of large numbers, which suggests that   enormous businesses struggle to put up or maintain strong growth   rates, Apple's revenue soared 13% to a mind-boggling $88.3   billion in the December quarter of last year. Any outlook that   calls for double-digit growth would approach $100 billion   (analysts are modeling for $92.9 billion).Gross margin outlook will also be important. Apple will enjoy   the benefit of operating leverage as revenue ramps, but costs   related to redesigning so many products will also rise. CFO Luca   Maestri has expressed optimism that memory pricing is   starting to improve, saying earlier this year that he hopes DRAM   prices will peak near the end of 2018.

 By Ju-min Park and Heekyong Yang SEOUL, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  slashed 2018 capex by more than a quarter on Wednesday and warned of lower profit until early next year, calling an end to a two-year boom in memory chips that fuelled record third-quarter profit. The downbeat forecast by the world's biggest maker of memory chips and smartphones adds to investor jitters over waning global demand for mobile and other electronics devices that roiled world stock market this month. "Looking further ahead to 2019, earnings are forecast to be weak for the first quarter due to seasonality, but then strengthen as business conditions, particularly in the memory market, improve," Samsung said in a statement. Analysts said the capex cut should ease concerns over further supply growth and price declines, as prices of some memory chips have already fallen to over two-year lows and rivals are set to start new production lines next year. Samsung, one of the industry's biggest buyers of chip-manufacturing tools, said its capital spending this year would drop by 27 percent to 31.8 trillion won ($28 billion) from a record 43.4 trillion won last year. "NAND (flash memory) chip prices will further decline through the first half of next year ... (as) Toshiba's   new production line will start and Hynix  starts mass production of one of its NAND lines," said Song Myung-sup, an analyst at HI Investment & Securities. "Oversupply is expected to continue." Samsung reported a record 17.6 trillion won operating profit in the July-September quarter, in line with the company's estimate.  With chip prices weakening after years of stellar growth, analysts expect Samsung's fourth-quarter profit will decline by 4 percent from the third quarter's record, according to Refinitiv data. That will be still up 11 percent from a year ago, helped by efficiency improvements and cost-cutting in the chip business, which accounts for nearly four-fifths of Samsung's operating profit. "Since Samsung continues to reduce the costs of (semiconductors), it is not very likely to witness a so-called hard-landing situation," said Avril Wu, senior research director at DRAMeXchange. Samsung said the memory chip market would regain stability after the first quarter of next year on higher server demand, chiming with the outlook given by South Korean peer SK Hynix last week.  The semiconductor business booked a 37 percent rise in operating profit to 13.7 trillion won, while the mobile business posted a 33 percent fall to 2.2 trillion won. Squeezed by competition with Apple Inc  in the premium segment and with Chinese rivals in other segments, Samsung's smartphone business saw profit fall to the lowest level since the first quarter of 2017. It plans to share details of its development of foldable smartphones at a conference early next month, hoping the model will help revive its premium cache. Samsung said third-quarter revenue rose 5.5 percent to 65.5 trillion won, slightly ahead of its guidance. Shares in Samsung, which has $265 billion in market value, traded flat. The stock has fallen 16 percent so far this year. ($1 = 1,139.1000 won)

Intel Roundup: Earnings, Micron & ARM Deals, New Chips, More
 October has been a busy month for Intel INTC  , with stellar earnings, the announcement of its next generation products, big deals with ARM and Rolls Royce, parting ways with Micron MU  and more. Here are the details- Earnings Intel reported a solid quarter with revenue and earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.8% and 5.8%, respectively. Both its data centric (current focus area) and PC centric (area of traditional strength) contributed to the performance. Most importantly, both businesses garnered improvement in volumes and prices.The PC business gained from upgrades by businesses, spurred by Microsoft ending support for older versions of Windows in developed countries and increased buying by gamers. Apple's AAPL  modem business also helped no doubt. Guidance was also better than expected. China tensions aren't bothering the company as of now, but could be a factor in the long term if trade tensions with the U.S. continue. Read more:  Intel Beats on Q3 Earnings & Revenues, Ups   '18 View   . Micron May Buy Intel Stake In JV Micron announced that it was taking full control of the Intel-Micron Flash Technologies (IMFT) JV, months after the companies said they would be taking their 3D Xpoint technology development in separate directions. Intel was first to market, although there's nothing to suggest that Micron won't catch up.3D Xpoint is basically a cross between the DRAM and NAND technologies offering non-volatile storage at significantly higher speeds than NAND and significantly lower cost than DRAM, making it suitable for a range of functions, but most notably in gaming and data center.  The deal terms reportedly require Micron to pay Intel $1.5 billion in cash and assume its $1 billion debt to the JV. Prior agreements require Micron to sell Intel 3D XPoint wafers up to a year after the deal's closing. Its Dalian fab will probably shift into gear after that. In its latest quarter, Intel took a $290 million charge as a result of Micron's decision to buy out its portion of a memory fabrication plant in UtahIntel however says that the announcement had come too soon, its written statement reads: "They can't officially make the call until January 1, 2019," and "The operation of the IMFT factory would not change until after the close of the call, which is at Intel's discretion for up to one year." New Chip Lineup Intel has announced the 9 th  generation of its Core desktop processors for gaming enthusiasts and content creators in particular, to ship in November. The X series as it's being called is still built on its 14nm process but includes support for Optane-based memory sticks, quad DDR4 memory channels modifications to deal with the Spectre and Meltdown attacks and more.The greater number of threads and cores should help it take on Advanced Micro Devices' AMD  recent chip advancements although it's worth keeping in mind that AMD's 7 nm chips are around the corner. So Intel will probably have to do more to contain AMD. The smaller company doesn't have its own manufacturing facilities however and also has a significantly smaller R&D budget, so Intel may still have the last laugh after all. ARM-Intel Agree Softbank-owned ARM and Intel have finally found some common ground, i.e. that they both have something to gain from the proliferation of IoT devices.ARM gains from the number of devices themselves because they require processors built on its low-power designs by companies like NXP, Renesas and Microchip's Atmel. Himagiri Mukkamala, an ARM senior vice president and general manager for its IoT Cloud Services, expects 100 billion ARM-based IoT devices in the next four to five years with the number going up to a trillion over the next two decades.   Intel gains from the number crunching that goes on with respect to the data captured by ARM-based IoT devices.Both gain when the devices operate in a secure environment. And that's why ARM's Pelion IoT management platform will use Intel's Secure Device Onboard specifications for automation and management of IoT devices, network connections and data transfers. Rolls Royce Partnership Intel is helping Rolls Royce take the autonomous car concept to ships, with the goal of helping cargo ships operate more safely, efficiently and cost effectively by minimizing crew members and using the extra space for more cargo.So the ships will come equipped with similar technology, including Rolls-Royce's Intelligent Awareness System (IAS) that uses sensor fusion for enhanced decision making, combining data from LiDAR, radar, thermal cameras, HD cameras, satellite data and weather forecasts.Each vessel can capture up to 1 TB of data per day that is then captured and stored using Intel's Xeon Scalable processor-based servers so that it can be downloaded and analyzed for additional insights once the ship has docked."This collaboration is helping us to develop technology that supports ship owners in the automation of their navigation and operations, reducing the opportunity for human error and allowing crews to focus on more valuable tasks," said Kevin Daffey, director, engineering and technology and ship intelligence at Rolls-Royce. ASML Stake Reduced Intel along with other chipmakers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co TSMC  had purchased stakes in ASML Holding N.V. ASML  back in 2012 when the company was trying to fund the development of its advanced lithography systems. The stake has been reduced over the years and with the latest sale, is now at just under 3%, according to Reuters. Recommendations Intel shares carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Dow Jumps 431 Points as Stocks End on a High Note
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will report earnings after the bell on Nov. 1. Analysts expect the Cupertino, California-based consumer electronics giant to report improved earnings and revenue. This will also serve as the first earnings report since the latest iPhone release. Still, regardless of the numbers reported by the company, the case for owning Apple stock remains solid.For the previous quarter, Wall Street forecasts earnings of $2.78 per share. If this holds, it will represent a 34.3% increase from last year when the company reported quarterly earnings of $2.07 per share. Analysts also predict revenues of $61.57 billion for the quarter. This comes in 17.1% higher than last year when the company brought in $52.58 billion.Apple exceeded earnings expectations in the previous four quarters. Considering the history of Apple stock, another earnings beat remains likely. However, I expect Wall Street will focus on sales of the latest iPhone models, the number one Apple product in terms of revenue.Still, no matter what Apple reports on iPhone sales, I believe Apple stock remains a long-term buy for the following five reasons:Apple has grown its fan base and fascinated the public with its innovations since the late 1990s. Despite its popularity, it has not translated into a high price-earnings (P/E) ratio for Apple stock. The current P/E for AAPL stock stands at just over 18.This does not compare well to the triple-digit P/E of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), or even the current P/E of just under 25 for Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ). Even Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG ), a Dow 30 component, which many tech investors would consider "boring," commands a P/E of just over 23.Others might blame the $1 trillion-plus market cap, arguing that the market has not yet prepared itself for a $2 trillion or a $3 trillion market cap. However, this trend held even when AAPL was a much smaller company. The average P/E for AAPL stock over the last five years comes to about 15.3.However, during the recent downturn, this low P/E has served as one reason Apple stock has avoided correction territory. Even if the market continues to fall, I do not think AAPL will see the levels of loss that other tech stocks have suffered. In fact, it would create a situation where AAPL stock becomes an even better buy.Profit growth has defined Apple stock since co-founder Steve Jobs began his second and final stint at the company. The iPod, along with the iPhone and other products, drove Apple from a company near bankruptcy to the world's largest publicly traded company.Despite its large size and the loss of Jobs's creative abilities, AAPL still enjoys double-digit growth rates. Over the past five years, AAPL stock saw average annual growth of almost 13.5%. The company has experienced an exceptionally strong year in 2018 with predicted net income growth of 28%. Analysts expect double-digit growth to continue over the next five years. They forecast average annual net income increases of almost 11.7% during that time.Moreover, I see little that will stop AAPL's growth. Even without Steve Jobs, the company has kept abreast of changing trends and continues to lead in smartphone innovation. The upcoming move to 5G wireless technology should bolster that trend over time. Hence, I see little that will stop its double-digit growth in the foreseeable future.While many Apple products retain their popularity, as mentioned before, the iPhone continues to drive the majority of company revenues. This persists despite the price increases and a seemingly continual need to update products.While last year's iPhone 8 experienced disappointing sales, the latest iPhone XR, its "discount" model which sells for $749, sold out of its initial supply in just four days. Analysts now expect an average iPhone sales price of $801 for the previous quarter, a record high.They believe the pricier iPhone XS and XS Max models will drive this average selling price. Moreover, they think the iPhone XS Max, the most expensive iPhone at $1,099, will outsell the iPhone XS. They also forecast sales of 46 million iPhones for the quarter.Apple also released both a new iPad Pro and an updated MacBook Air and Mac Mini at this week's product launch event. The new iPads will include larger displays, increased storage space while becoming the thinnest versions ever. The MacBook Air will consist of not only the retina display but four times the pixels of the previous model. It will also include Touch ID.Stock observers will like that the new iPad starts at $799, while the new MacBook Air starts at $1,199, $200 more than the previous MacBook Air. If iPhone sales give any indications, these products should help to drive revenues higher for the next few quarters.Apple stock remains a latecomer to dividend payments, having initiated its first dividend payment in 2012. However, it has increased this dividend every year since the dividend began. For 2018, the dividend stands at $2.92 per share, a yield of about 1.35%.Its yield may appear low. However, the annual increases may signal that the company plans to pursue an eventual "dividend aristocrat" status. If this pace continues, it will join an elite group of stocks that has increased its dividend annually for 25 or more years. Moreover, with a cash position that stood at $243.7 billion as of the previous earnings report, AAPL should have no trouble retaining and increasing this dividend payment.Furthermore, some long-term holders of Apple stock will enjoy particularly valuable rewards. Investors who bought AAPL before September 2004 purchased the equity at or below the price of its current dividend. Hence, this group of investors receives their initial investment back every year without selling a single share!While I do not see new buyers enjoying such a privilege, I think it speaks well to the long-term dividend rewards of buying and holding Apple stock.Admittedly, this only relates to Apple stock indirectly, but the company holds to a reason for why it exists. The Simon Sinek TEDx talk "Start With Why"  explained its appeal well. AAPL stock continues to grow in value and yield ever higher growth and dividends. While that pads the portfolios of its stockholders nicely, these profits remain a result of Apple's why, not its core aim.As trite as this may sound, Steve Jobs founded Apple with the vision of changing the world and challenging the status quo. This vision has built a fan base for Apple. So passionate is that fan base that they will wait in line for hours to buy the latest iPhone upon its release. The fact that one could purchase these products in a few weeks without waiting has not discouraged the lines.At the end of the day, Apple remains a computer and a device company. Yet, Samsung does not see this kind of reaction when it releases its smartphones. More importantly, this vision inspires the innovations that sway the hardcore Apple lovers to need the latest gadget now. Such passion translates into higher profits and more stock price growth for the holders of Apple stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

It's one of the few tech titans whose shares are still trading near their 5-year highs. Can it continue to ignore the market pullback and rise to greater heights?4.    Weight Watchers WTW   was one of the hottest stocks of 2017 and early 2018. It has beat 8 quarters in a row and has grown its subscribers by the double digits during that time. But it now faces tougher year-over-year comparables. Shares have come off the recent highs. It now trades with a forward P/E of 21. Is it a growth bargain?5.    Shake Shack SHAK   hasn't missed since it's 2015 IPO. That's impressive. Wall Street will be more concerned with labor and commodities costs, however, as a tight job market is making it difficult in the industry to keep good employees. It's been on a big growth spurt, opening up dozens of new restaurants but with a forward P/E of 81, is it too hot to handle?

Apple's Latest iPad Pro Could Boost Average Selling Prices
  Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been very successful in growing iPhone revenue   over the course of the company's fiscal year 2018 thanks to   significant growth in   average selling prices    . It certainly helped that Apple's iPhone X -- a device that   started at $999 -- proved to be   quite popular    .It would seem that with the launch of the latest versions of   its iPad Pro tablets, Apple took a simple step that could   potentially boost iPad average selling prices over the course of   this product cycle.  Image source: Apple.Let's see what Apple did.Apple's previous iPad Pro tablets came in 64GB, 256GB, and   512GB storage configurations. The company's latest models come in   those same configurations, but with 1TB (that's 1,024GB) versions   layered on top.Those devices don't come cheap. The new 11-inch and 12.9-inch   iPad Pros with 1TB of storage cost $1,549 and $1,749,   respectively, when configured with only Wi-Fi -- $400 more than   their counterparts with 512GB of storage. Those prices go all the   way up to $1,699 and $1,899 for the versions with cellular   connectivity.It's hard to estimate just what percentage of new iPad Pro   buyers will choose the 1TB versions, but that percentage won't be   zero. Since Apple simply didn't sell iPads with 1TB of storage   during its previous product cycle, any sales of the 1TB models   would have a positive year-over-year impact on average selling   prices and, ultimately, overall iPad revenue.Since larger storage capacities represent a relatively easy   way to boost average selling prices, Apple's job will be to make   an increasing number of iPad Pro buyers value increased storage   space enough to be willing to pay for higher-capacity models.Although the addition of the higher storage tier should help   improve iPad average selling prices, there are other aspects of   the latest iPad Pro product line that could do the same.For instance, in the last product generation, the 10.5-inch   iPad Pro had fairly slim side bezels, while the 12.9-inch model   had very large side bezels, giving it a disproportionately larger   physical footprint compared with the 10.5-inch model. The   12.9-inch model may have been viewed as unwieldy compared to last   year's 10.5-inch model, which could have pushed some prospective   buyers toward the smaller -- and cheaper -- tablet.In the new product lineup, though, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro has   a dramatically-reduced overall size compared with its   predecessor, even though it has the same screen size. I wouldn't   be surprised to see some iPad buyers who would have picked the   10.5-inch model in the previous generation opt for the 12.9-inch   version in this generation as a result.To the extent that buyers become more likely to choose the   12.9-inch iPad Pro over its 11-inch counterpart (and, of course,   assuming identical storage configurations), average selling   prices could rise.

Apple Unveils New Macs and iPads: What You Need to Know
  Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) just finished its October event, cementing its   product lineup as the company heads into the all-important   holiday shopping season. The Mac maker had unveiled new iPhones   and a new Apple Watch last month, and has now shown off a new   MacBook Air, Mac Mini, and iPad Pro. Those Macs have been the   most neglected in recent years, putting them in dire need of   updates. That's especially true for the MacBook Air, which has   long been one of the most popular and iconic laptops in the   industry.Here's everything Apple showed off this morning.  New MacBook Air. Image source: Apple.Apple has redesigned the MacBook Air, finally including a   13.3-inch high-resolution Retina display in the laptop and   completing its transition to those displays that it started six   years ago. The outgoing Air's display hasn't been competitive for   years, as Windows PC makers started shifting to higher-resolution   displays long ago. The overall design remains familiar, but Apple   is expectedly moving to USB-C ports and its butterfly mechanism   keyboard.After first bringing Touch ID to the MacBook Pro   a couple years ago    , Apple is now adding its fingerprint recognition system to the   MacBook Air. The big difference is there is no Touch Bar, which   has proven to be a rather controversial feature, particularly   among professional users. Like all recent Macs, the new laptop   includes Apple's custom T2 security chip. The new MacBook Air   starts at $1,199, and Apple will still sell the old model for   $999.  New Mac Mini. Image source: Apple.The new Mac Mini looks identical to its predecessor, but gets   some desperately needed internal updates including quad- and   six-core processors from   Intel    and all-flash storage. Pretty much all of the changes are   internal, including a new thermal system. The diminutive desktop   now starts at $799, up from $499. Apple noted that the new Mac   Mini could cater to some professional use cases -- it can be   maxed out at a whopping $4,199 with all the bells and   whistles.It was always   inevitable    that Apple would bring the iPhone X's edge-to-edge display and   TrueDepth camera to the iPad Pro. OLED displays are still   prohibitively expensive to include on a tablet this large, so   Apple is using much of the same Liquid Retina LCD display   technology found in the iPhone XR. The new iPad Pros come in   11-inch and 12.9-inch configurations and have been completely   redesigned. Unlike in iPhones, there is no notch. The TrueDepth   camera system is embedded into the smaller bezels, and Face ID   will work in both landscape and portrait mode.  New iPad Pro. Image source: Apple.Apple has opted to use USB-C instead of its proprietary   Lightning connector in the device, a wise decision since Apple   overtly positions the iPad Pro as a professional device and many   pros rely heavily on USB-C accessories in their workflow.   Besides, Apple has received enough criticism for forcing a   plethora of dongles on its user base. The company also updated   its Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil accessories, with the latter   borrowing a page out of   Microsoft    's Surface playbook and magnetically snapping to the side of the   tablet, where it charges wirelessly. (Surface Pen doesn't charge   but instead uses replaceable batteries.)

 By Cate Cadell and Jane Lanhee Lee Oct 30 (Reuters) - Chinese search engine operator Baidu Inc  on Wednesday forecast lower-than-expected sales for the rest of the year, citing looming economic uncertainty and tough new regulations that have impacted its ad clients. The company said revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 will likely be 25.48 billion to 26.72 billion yuan, below the 27.6 billion yuan average of 17 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv. Baidu's U.S.-listed stock was down 1.4 percent in after-hours trading. The stock has fallen more than 20 percent since the beginning of the year, mirroring similar losses at peers Alibaba Group Holding Ltd  and Tencent Holdings Ltd. China's technology companies have suffered in 2018 amid a string of new regulations, which have led to a suspension in online game releases and further restricted the advertising industry. Economic concern linked to trade tension between China and the U.S. has also caused advertisers to tighten their budgets, said Baidu executives, impacting spending in the real estate, finance and online commerce industries.  Baidu took a further hit earlier this year on news reports about Alphabet Inc'sGoogle working on plans to re-launch a search engine in China after it left the market almost seven years ago in protest of censorship restrictions. Addressing analyst questions about Google, Baidu Chief Executive Officer Robin Li said, "It's a very fast-growing, fast-changing market... I don't think a non-China-based company has that kind of competence to compete." Baidu has undergone an internal transformation since 2016, when a damaging medical ad scandal led to new rules that significantly reduced the number of ad clients eligible to use its platform. Company executives on Wednesday said efforts to clean up medical advertising on the platform were ongoing, and could continue to impact sales. "A proactive effort to improve the structure of healthcare information may impact our ad revenue in the near future," said CFO Yu. Since 2016, Baidu has divested several large business units that compete directly with heavyweights Alibaba and Tencent, including its online food delivery business and finance unit. Meanwhile, it is continuing to invest heavily in artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. Despite the weakened fourth-quarter sales forecast, Baidu posted slightly better-than-expected sales for its third quarter. Revenue was 28.2 billion yuan ($4.11 billion), beating the average estimate of 27.53 billion yuan. Net income rose 56 percent from a year earlier to 12.4 billion yuan, also slightly above estimates, though its operating margin dropped to 16 percent from 21 percent as it invests in new technology. Excluding gains from the recent divestiture of its financial services business, Baidu posted adjusted earnings per share of 19.01 yuan versus the 16.70 yuan estimate. CEO Li said revenue gain in the third quarter was linked to improvement in its search platform and news feed using artificial intelligence. Traffic growth on Baidu's mobile app also helped drive third-quarter revenue. Baidu has become one of China's biggest names in AI, with its efforts endorsed by the government as well as international firms. This month, it became the first Chinese company to join an AI ethics group alongside members such as Google and Apple Inc. Li said the impact of regulation and trade fears could extend beyond 2018, but that he is still positive about the company's prospects both overseas and at home. "The longer term, I'm still very optimistic about the future of Baidu and the future of China."

Waymo gets first California OK for driverless testing without backup driver
 By David Shepardson and Alexandria Sage WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's  Waymo unit on Tuesday became the first company to receive a permit from the state of California to test driverless vehicles without a backup driver in the front seat, the state's Department of Motor Vehicles said. California said Waymo can use about three dozen test vehicles without drivers behind the wheel in Santa Clara County, part of the greater technology hub of Silicon Valley. About 60 companies have permits in California to test self-driving cars with such a backup driver, including most major automakers and Apple Inc. New regulations adopted by the state allowing companies to test on public roads without a driver with a special permit took effect in April.  As part of winning approval, Waymo must continuously monitor the status of test vehicles and provide two-way communication with passengers, carry at least $5 million in insurance and notify local communities. Waymo's permit includes day and night testing on city streets, rural roads and highways with posted speed limits of up to 65 miles per hour (105 kph). The company said its vehicles can safely handle fog and light rain, and testing in those conditions is allowed. Waymo said it will begin driverless testing on city streets in Silicon Valley and expand to other areas after it notifies local communities. The company will first use Waymo employees in tests and eventually "create opportunities for members of the public to experience this technology, as we've done in Arizona with our early rider program." In Arizona, Waymo has been conducting some testing of vehicles without backup drivers and has said it plans to launch a commercial self-driving ride hailing service in the state by the end of 2018. Last week, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on an earnings call that customers were beginning to pay for rides in Arizona and the company was testing pricing models. Waymo is considered to be at the forefront of self-driving, due to its decade of testing and millions of miles driven. Also on Tuesday, Volkswagen AG  Chief Financial Officer Frank Witter cited Waymo as an industry leader and said the German automaker would be open to deeper alliances with others.  California's new requirements call for remote control technology, which allows for a remote operator to take control of a vehicle if the underlying autonomous system inside the car encounters problems. Companies like Waymo, Nissan Motor Co  and startups Zoox, Phantom Auto and Starsky Robotics have been working on such technology. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration declined to comment on Tuesday but reiterated earlier this month that as long as driverless vehicles have steering wheels and pedals, they do not need preapproval from the agency to test on public roads.

Apple Event: New iPad Pro With Face ID and New Macs
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) just wrapped up its second big event of the fall. This first was September's annual iPhone event , where the new iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR were unveiled. However, the company still had plenty of hardware left to show off. And it did so today in New York, in a showcase focused on creativity. Here's everything you need to know about the final Apple event of 2018.Apple has been expected to make a big move with its iPad Pro line. The company's prosumer tablets are facing a new Surface Pro 6 from Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). And earlier this month, Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google took the wraps off the new Pixel Slate.  Google's 12.3-inch tablet has an optional keyboard cover, runs Chrome plus Android apps, and is aimed squarely at the iPad Pro.Today Apple responded.Like the iPhone, the new iPad Pro loses the Home button. As a result, it gets smaller bezels, but they're still big enough that no notch is needed for its TrueDepth camera and Face ID support (in both landscape and portrait). It uses the same Liquid Retina Display technology as the iPhone XR. Power is provided by Apple's A12X Bionic chip that the company claims makes the new iPad Pro fast than 92% of all portable PCs. Apple is pushing the iPad Pro as having graphics capabilities that rivals game consoles. Showing off its power for creative professionals, Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) demonstrated Photoshop running on the new iPad Pro, as well as Project Arrow - the company's new augmented reality app.In an iPad first, the new iPad Pro ditches Apple's proprietary Lightning port for USB-C, including they ability to output video to a 5K display and support for a wider range of accessories.The previous 10.5-inch model remains the same total size but gets an 11-inch display. The new 12.9-inch iPad Pro has the same size display as the previous model, but the total size shrinks to "basically the same size as an 8.5 x 11-inch sheet of paper" while getting 15% thinner.Also announced was second generation Apple Pencil stylus. It attaches to the new iPad Pro magnetically and automatically recharges wirelessly. A new Smart Keyboard Foleo was also introduced and also attaches magnetically.The new iPad Pro will be available for pre-order today (shipping next week), with prices starting at $799 for the 11-inch model and $999 for the 12.9-inch model. The current 10.5-inch iPad Pro will remain for sale, at $649.Apple's Mac sales have been slumping and a big part of that is the company's apparent lack of attention to its entry-level models. The MacBook Air and Mac Mini - the most affordable Apple laptop and desktop, respectively - were ancient, with specs that were years out of date.At today's Apple event, the company finally took the wraps off modern replacements.Describing the MacBook Air as "the most beloved notebook ever," Tim Cook took the wraps off its new MacBook Air. The replacement to Apple's entry-level laptop finally gets a high resolution, 13.3-inch Retina display. Bezels are 50% smaller, and new color options for the 100% recycled aluminum case include Gold. The processor is an 8th-generation Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Core i5. RAM now maxes out at 16GB and storage at 1.5TB. It also features two USB-C (Thunderbolt 3) ports, though it loses native support for legacy USB devices and ditches its SD card slot. Apple added Touch ID support in the keyboard and went with a bigger, Force Touch trackpad. Battery life on Wifi remains at 12 hours (13 hours of watching video).The new MacBook Air is 17% smaller and a quarter-pound lighter, but its price is going up, starting at $1,199 (versus $999 for the older model).The new Mac Mini looks the same as before (other than a Space Gray finish), but now using 8th generation Intel desktop CPUs with quad-core and six-core options. Apple says it is up to five times faster. RAM capacity increases to 64GB, solid state storage maxes out at 2TB and the new Mac Mini gets a ton of ports: four USB-C (Thunderbolt 3), a pair of legacy USB 3.1 ports, HDMI and Ethernet. The new Mac Mini is stackable, and starts at $799 (previously $499).The new Macs are available for pre-order today, and in stores starting November 7.With the new iPad Pro models, new Macs and the recently released new iPhones, Apple is going into the holiday sales season with a strong new product lineup. Now it's a waiting game to see if the upgrades are enough to fend off rivals - and to find out if price hikes for the new entry level Macs are going to scare off budget-conscious shoppers.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s.The post Apple Event: New iPad Pro With Face ID and New Macs appeared first on InvestorPlace .
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhether you're on the left or right side of the aisle, investors are voting it's time to find stocks to short.Blame Monday's failed rally on what you will. But if you need an excuse, increased tariff concerns and uncertainty surrounding next week's mid-term elections were certainly two crowd favorites. Yet all that really matters is a nasty and bearish intraday U-turn following an out-the-gate spasm reflex to bargain hunt.The failure by bulls to hold the line after last week's dramatic selloff shows that the only treat for investors in the weeks ahead may be to find stocks to short that are technically poised to head lower.Still, to avoid potential tricks in stocks that are well-oversold, investors need to be careful. Bull or bear, volatility is raging right now and deserves our respect. That's why, after scouring tons of price charts, I've identified the following three stocks to short as we'll explore below.The first of our stocks to short in big tech is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). If there was ever a stock that's sacrosanct with investors, it's likely AAPL stock. Nevertheless, the world's largest company reports earnings this Thursday, and the price chart hints strongly that Apple shares are forming a topping pattern.Specifically, AAPL is setting up as a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern with a well-supported stochastics picture pointing at lower prices to come. In Monday's session Apple shares penetrated the neckline, but did manage to rally and finish above support.On the downside, a measured move out of the head and shoulders top should propel AAPL towards $190 to fill a bullish earnings gap from July, as well as a test of the 200-day simple moving average.Next on our list of stocks to short in big tech is Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). I've been a big and fairly consistent fan of MSFT stock the past couple years since shares cleared their previous highs from before the dot-com bust. The company I've also called Microsoft Version 2.0 has enjoyed a terrific run, but it's now faltering and poised for a larger correction.On the weekly price chart, MSFT has made a decisive break below the channel support line formed this year. An initial failure occurred in the first half of October. But after a mixed earnings report featuring a profit-and-sales beat but slowing growth for Microsoft's new crown-jewel cloud-computing unit, shares hit fresh relative lows, making Microsoft one of our stocks to short.Knowing healthier corrections in a market heavyweight like MSFT can lead to losses of up to 30% and still be regarded as normal, there's a lot of potential in short selling shares. But in order to gain the upper hand, I recommend shorting Microsoft closer to resistance near $108 - $109.If given the opportunity to short into a rally, I'd set a tight stop above $109.50. That would put Microsoft shares back above the trendline and post-earnings pivot high.The last name on our list of stocks to short is IT-consulting outfit Accenture (NYSE: ACN ). ACN stock isn't a tech pure play like AAPL or MSFT. But as the price chart attests, shares of Accenture are shortable today.A massive market-related price breakdown in early October sent ACN shares beneath key angular and lateral support. And ACN stock hasn't looked back since. Accenture quickly took out its 200-day simple moving average before proceeding to form a bearish flag mostly below the key longer-term price line.Monday's session reaffirmed the prior week's breakdown of the flag. And with shares just narrowly below the bearish pattern, ACN is ready for short selling today.While ACN stock is ready for short selling today, don't be fooled by the bearish pattern. A money stop of 5% to 6% - which puts shares back above the long-term moving average and the highs of the flag - is a sensible plan of attack. Alternatively, a smaller position and stop loss of 9% above $166 works to keep ACN stock shorts out of harm's way.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN , Apple Inc. AAPL and Microsoft Corporation MSFT .Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog:Microsoft a Buy on Replacing Amazon as 2nd-Most Valued US FirmAmazon.com, Inc. had briefly touched $1-trillion market cap in early September, becoming the most valuable tech firm after Apple Inc. But, Amazon erased $68.1 billion in market cap on Oct 26 after the e-commerce giant missed Wall Street's revenue expectations in the third quarter (read more: Amazon Stock Still Looks Strong Despite Q3 Revenue Miss ).Jeff Bezos' e-commerce giant saw its shares plummet 7.8% on the final day of trading last week, the stock's worst drop since Oct 24, 2014. Amazon's market cap is currently around $803.28 billion, while Bezos lost $11 billion in equity value in the last trading session.These made tech titan Microsoft Corporation the second-largest company in the United States. Microsoft had been the largest company in the late 1998 through early 2000 before the dot-com bubble burst.Several analysts believe that Microsoft will eventually top the coveted $1-trillion mark as it continues to successfully compete with Amazon in cloud computing, while enjoying gains in cloud computing and its personal computer business.Microsoft's Cloud Strategy Pays OffMicrosoft's new strategy, called hybrid computing, in which customers run software in their own data centers but also use cloud services, propelled the company's cloud-services revenues in the fiscal first quarter.Its cloud-computing business, called Azure, does find it quite challenging to maintain growth rates as the business approaches an estimated $10 billion in annual revenues. Still, Azure's growth remains robust as sales rise 76% in the fiscal first quarter.Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, which not only includes Azure but also server products, increased 24% to $8.57 billion, up 23.8% year over year. Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst Brad Reback added that "this result absolutely shows Microsoft's hybrid-cloud strength."Overall, Microsoft reported first-quarter fiscal earnings of $1.14 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 18 cents. Revenues of $29.08 billion exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27.73 billion (read more: Microsoft Beats on Q1 Earnings, Azure Aids Top Line ).Credit also goes to the company's CEO Satya Nadella. He took quite a few valuable assets like Microsoft Office and moved them to the cloud and created cloud-hosted software services. This transition boosted profit margin and revenues.Microsoft a Solid BuyThe performance of Azure has not only fueled Microsoft's return to the list of highest valued U.S. public companies but will also help the software giant gain further traction. Thus, the company's expected growth rate for the current year is 13.1%, higher than the industry's rise of 9.6%. Microsoft has outperformed the Computer - Software industry so far this year (+25.1% vs +17.1%).If this wasn't enough, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company saw 14 earnings estimates moved north in the past 60 days, while none moved south for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings rose 3.3% in the same period. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.On the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, Microsoft is currently trading at 24.38X compared to the industry's 27.52X. Moreover, the company is presently trading at the low end of its annual range of 28.07X to 23.65X and below the median of 25.68X. Thus, it has significant upside potential.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

The cause and nature of the crash has yet to be determined, but traders weren't unwilling to come to a conclusion that at least partially implicated the company.At the other end of the spectrum Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) was up another 3.3%, with investors continuing to celebrate last week's encouraging earnings news and assurance that the dividend is intact . There just weren't enough stories like Ford's to do the market much good. Decliners almost doubled advancers.That extreme volatility doesn't mean there aren't good trading opportunities. But, it does mean traders will want to choose carefully. Stock charts of Extra Space Storage (NYSE: EXR ), Visa (NYSE: V ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) are shaping up as some of the more reliable prospects. Here's why.Most REITs have performed well of late, reflecting changes in the economic backdrop more so than major improvements in their business operations.Shares of Extra Space Storage, however, are particularly interesting thanks to Monday's big gain that confirms support was met a couple of weeks ago. If the pattern repeats itself, this could be the onset of a significant move higher.
 Click to Enlarge • The reversal out of a downtrend and back into an uptrend beginning in early October was interesting, but not confirmed until the stock pushed above the 200-day moving average line at $89.98, plotted in white on both stock charts.• Zooming out to the weekly chart it's clear that the prompt for the current upswing is a brush of the rising support line, dashed, that's tagged all of the major lows going back to early 2017.• The scope of the potential runup from here could mirror the big gain seen between February and July. That was roughly a 22-point move.Visa is essentially caught between a rock and a hard place. Early this month it broke below some key lines in the sand that have since become a technical ceiling. But, it has also found support at a familiar technical floor. One or the other has to break, and if the volume data is any indication, it's the floor that's more apt to break.
 Click to Enlarge • On the daily chart, Visa shares attempted to break back above the gray 100-day moving average line and the blue 20-day moving average line late last week and again today, but was unable to do so. Yet, the white 200-day moving average line has thus far also been a floor.• While V remains range-bound for now, there's been decisively more bearish volume than bullish volume of late (save Thursday's one-off).• Should the 200-day moving average line ultimately fail to hold up as support, the weekly chart shows a massive amount of pullback potential. The next-best bet for a technical floor is around $116, near where shares found turbulence early this year.Finally, Apple was dissected on Friday, after failing to break under a key technical support level, but being unable to push its way back above some key technical resistance.Nothing really changed on Friday, and in some ways nothing really changed on Monday. Monday's intraday action from AAPL shares, however, may well force the traders on both sides of the table to go ahead and show their hands.
 Click to Enlarge  • The line in the sand is right around $212.45, plotted with a dashed yellow line on the daily chart. That floor had held until Monday, but note that Apple shares were still unwilling to remain below that mark on a closing basis.• On an intraday basis things were alarming around mid-day, but the bulls stepped back in after the gray 100-day moving average line was kissed.• The bulls are technically holding the line, so to speak, but their fight is getting tougher. One or two more bad days, particularly if the broad market continues to melt down, could push Apple shares over the edge.As of this writing, James Brumley held a long position in Ford.

 By Angela Moon and Stephen Nellis NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Apple Inc  refreshed some of its lesser-known products at a New York event on Tuesday, adding iPhone features like facial recognition to the iPad Pro and faster processors and better displays to some Mac computers that had gone years without a major update. The devices will hit stores on Nov. 7. Counting new iPhones and Apple Watches released last month, Apple will have more than half a dozen new products on shelves for the holiday shopping season, many at higher prices than previous models.  Prices for the iPad Pros increased to $799 and $999 for 11- and 12.9-inch models, though Apple plans to keep an older 10.5-inch version on sale for $649. Apple unveiled the updates at an opera house at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, calling the venue a haven for creative activity. The company has been working to win back professionals like graphic designers targeted by Microsoft with its Surface tablets, which have gained market share this year. Apple also played up software partnerships with Adobe Inc  and Autodesk Inc, whose programs will now work on Apple's iPad Pro. In July Apple reported its worst quarter of Mac sales since 2010, with unit volumes down 13 percent year over year, while iPad unit sales rose only 1 percent from a year earlier. Revenue for both fell 5 percent from the prior year.  A new version of the Mac Book Air, originally released in 2011, will feature a higher-resolution display and thinner bezels and start at $1,199, up from $999. "Yes, you save a bit compared to the Mac Book Pro, but that's not your main reason for buying it," which is instead power and portability, said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies. She said Apple "knows they have a very loyal user base that will be willing to spend the money." Apple said the Mac Mini, a small desktop customers provide their own display and accessories for, would add processing power and memory capacity and start at $799, also an increase. As with previous models, the new machines rely on processors from Intel Corp, but Apple said an increasing number of security features on the devices are being handled by its own so-called T2 chip. Apple introduced new iPhones and Apple Watches last month, but the older product lines accounted for $45 billion in sales in the most recent fiscal quarter. In comparison, iPhones brought in revenue of $141.3 billion. "They really wanted to show the world they haven't forgotten about the iPad and the Mac," said Mika Kitagawa, a senior principal research analyst at Gartner. Some of the recent dip in Mac sales can be explained by timing. Apple had waited until July to release new Macs, instead of June as in previous years. And Mac sales growth has outpaced the PC market, while the iPad has been the most successful tablet in a market that turned out to be smaller than Apple hoped when it released the device in 2010. Microsoft's Surface line offers a hybrid between a tablet and laptop that runs Microsoft's full Windows operating system. The iPad Pro runs the same operating system as iPhones. The iPad Pro models have a USB-C port that allows them to work with an external monitor for the first time. When combined with the existing ability for an iPad Pro to work with a keyboard, the new port brings the devices closer to becoming a laptop competitor, Milanesi said. "When people are looking at using this as their main computing device, that's where you might seem the move toward the 12.9-inch" iPad Pro, she said. Apple shares last traded nearly flat at $212.39.

Can Apple Keep Its Streak Alive When It Reports Earnings?
 Even in the face of recent market unrest,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares are still clocking in near all-time highs   hit earlier this month. The company has steadfastly resisted Wall   Street's attempt to call the top by continuing to innovate on its   flagship iPhone, working to double its subscription revenue, and   developing new products and services.The Cupertino company will get its next chance at bat when   Apple reports the financial results for its fiscal fourth   quarter, after the market close on Nov. 1. Let's review the   company's recent results and see what we can expect when Apple   reports earnings.  Apple exec Phil Schiller on stage introducing the iPhone XS.     Image source: Apple.For the fiscal third quarter (which ended June 30), Apple   again defied expectations    . It reported sales of $53.3 billion, an increase of 17% year   over year, exceeding analysts' consensus estimates and topping   out at the high end of its forecast. Careful cost control   resulted in operating income that also grew by 17% compared to   the prior-year quarter, resulting in diluted earnings per share   of $2.34, up 40% year over year and easily exceeding the high end   of expectations.iPhones continued their trek higher, selling 41.3 million   units: up 1% compared to the prior-year quarter, but slightly   below the 41.6 million expected by analysts. Apple made up the   difference by selling more high-priced models, with the average   selling price of $724 increasing 19% compared to the same period   last year.Apple's Other Products business -- which includes Apple Watch,   AirPods, Apple TV, Beats headphones, and the HomePod smart   speaker -- produced the highest segment growth for the company,   with revenue of $3.74 billion, up 37% year over year.Even though the newest iPhones didn't go on sale until the end   of the most recent quarter -- which ended at the end of September   -- investors will be looking for any insight into how the iPhone   XS (pronounced 10 S), XS Max, and XR are selling as Apple still   derives the majority of its sales -- more than 56% last quarter   -- from its flagship device. The XS and XS Max went on sale Sept.   21, while the release of the XR was delayed until Oct. 26 (which   falls in Apple's first quarter).Investors will also be looking for an update on Apple's plans   to get its services revenue to $51 billion by 2020. As of last   quarter, the iPhone maker had achieved a   run rate    of $35.7 billion, placing the goal well within Apple's reach.Apple's wearables will be another area of interest. Wearables,   which includes the Apple Watch, Beats, and AirPod, jumped 60% in   the third quarter. The company reported in July that wearables   revenue had surpassed $10 billion over the past four   quarters.Share repurchases have also been a hot topic in recent   quarters. Apple earlier this year embarked on a $100 billion   buyback, replacing the $210 billion allocation that the company   exhausted in the fiscal third quarter. Last quarter, Apple wasted   no time, buying back a whopping $20 billion in shares. During the   company's   second-quarter conference call    , Apple CFO Luca Maestri said investors should expect the   repurchases to be done "efficiently and at a fast pace," so watch   for an update on the declining share count.  Apple execs Tim Cook, right, and Jony Ive, left, looking at     the iPhone XR. Image source: Apple.For the fiscal fourth quarter, Apple is expecting revenue of   $60 billion to $62 billion, which would represent year-over-year   growth of 14% to 18%. The company is also calling for gross   margin of 38% to 38.5%, and operating expenses of about $8   billion.Analysts' consensus estimates are calling for revenue of   $61.48 billion, up 16.9% year over year and near the high end of   Apple's forecast; earnings per share are being pegged at $2.78,   rising 34.3% compared to the prior-year quarter.While investors keep waiting for the other shoe to drop, Apple   continues to march to the beat of a different drummer. This   quarter will likely be a continuation of what we have seen   before.  10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

  When   Netflix     first debuted its streaming service in 2007, the idea was   exciting but odd: Who would want to watch a movie on a computer?   That soon turned out to be the wrong question to ask. As   Roku    (NASDAQ: ROKU) soon proved, the real question was which companies   would step up and create ways for Netflix fans to stream content   to their television screens.Today, most homes have some means of streaming Netflix on a   TV. Smart TVs are the new normal, and streaming boxes like the   one Roku debuted way back in 2008 are everywhere. As of last   year, at least one device capable of streaming video to a TV   could be found in   58.7% of U.S. households    . And most of those streaming devices run one of just two major   streaming platforms: Roku and   Amazon    's (NASDAQ: AMZN) Fire TV.  Image source: Getty Images.That means that Roku and Fire TV are archenemies. And this   holiday season, a showdown is brewing.When it comes to market share, no other streaming platforms   are close to Roku and Fire TV. Roku has the lead right now: 37%   of streamers opt for Roku devices, compared to 28% for Fire TV.   Other streaming devices and platforms are comparatively weak   players:   Alphabet    's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Chromecast, for instance, has   just half as large a market share as Fire TV and has been losing   ground, per   Parks Associates' 2018 findings    . DATA SOURCE: PARKS ASSOCIATESIt's not hard to see how each company got here. Roku has been   in this game from the start, having debuted its first streaming   box and essentially invented this space in 2008, not long after   Netflix first began to offer online streaming. Amazon had the   corporate muscle to make a splash when it entered the market with   the first Fire TV device in 2014. The fact that Amazon could   promote its own hardware on its massively popular e-commerce   website surely did not hurt. (Amazon has also used its position   as an e-commerce giant to hurt its competitors -- for instance,   Amazon kept Chromecast devices out of its online store for a time   last year.)Roku enjoys a huge user base and rave reviews from tech   writers. But Amazon's Fire TV platform has fans, too, and Amazon   has a structural advantage that looms large as the holiday   shopping season arrives. As holiday shoppers flock to Amazon.com,   look for Amazon to make a big push to overtake Roku in the   streaming device market.Roku's early arrival has made it the platform to beat. But   Amazon, unlike other competitors, has shown an ability to grow   its market share despite a late arrival. Amazon moved from a 16%   market share in 2016 to a 24% share in 2017 before reaching this   year's 28% share. By contrast,   Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL) Apple TV lost ground in 2017 and held steady in   2018, and Chromecast lost ground from 2017 to 2018.Amazon's growth has a lot to do with its status as an   e-commerce giant. You can buy Roku, (since the end of a brief   spat in 2017) Chromecast, or Apple TV devices on Amazon, but a   glance at   Amazon's top sellers in the streaming media   player category    will surprise exactly no one. Fire TV devices hold the top two   spots.  Image source: Getty Images.Still, Roku fares surprisingly well on Amazon's streaming   media player best-seller list. Amazon will hope that its   "Amazon's Choice" label on search results, intrasite banner ads,   and special sales will help its streaming platform dominate on   its shopping platform this holiday season.Of course, Amazon isn't the only one hoping for big holiday   sales. Roku has not been standing pat, and its recent release of   a   very affordable 4K-capable streaming device    shows that it still has a few tricks up its sleeve. (It's no   mistake that the more affordable streaming devices dominate   Amazon's streaming media player best-seller list, nor is it a   mistake that Roku is attacking Amazon at a price point where it   does very well.) That device and its low price point are an   assault on Fire TV's popular low-priced models.But Amazon may yet answer with new hardware, and the   e-commerce giant has already countered with price discounts.Roku will have to maintain its advantages and make the most of   sales at brick-and-mortar stores and competing e-retailers like   Best Buy    and   Walmart    . Roku has a special relationship with the latter that includes   device exclusives.Online shopping is the new normal for holiday gift buying, and   millennials -- a key demographic for cord-cutting products and   services -- are   especially likely to shop online    . That helps Amazon. Will it be enough to make up a   still-significant gap in market share?Roku's platform is a proven winner and has plenty of dedicated   fans, but it's not hard to imagine Amazon closing the gap or even   finally overtaking Roku this holiday season. The structural   advantages in Fire TV's corner are massive, and it shouldn't take   much more than common sense for Amazon to parlay its standing as   a holiday shopping destination into gains in the streaming   platform market.Amazon gained 4% in market share last year. It seems poised to   grow at least that much this year, especially given the fading   impact of Chromecast, which occupies a lower price point that   Amazon has long done well in. Reaching Roku's 37% might be a tall   order, but it seems like a given that Amazon will find its way   into at least a third of streaming households by the time this   year's holiday gifts are unwrapped.A disappearing lead would be bad news for Roku, of course.   Though dedicated fans and a still-large market share ensure that   the company won't go anywhere fast, losing the No. 1 spot would   be a big blow to a brand that focuses entirely on its streaming   platform and devices. Unfortunately for Roku, Amazon's much   broader approach might be the very thing that makes the company   hard to beat this holiday season.  10 stocks we like better than Amazon       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Britain to target online giants with new 'Digital Services Tax'
 By Paul Sandle LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Britain said it would tax the revenue that online platforms such as Google, Facebook  and Amazon  make in the country to update a system that had not kept pace with changing digital business models. "It's clearly not sustainable, or fair, that digital platform businesses can generate substantial value in the UK without paying tax here in respect of that business," finance minister Philip Hammond said in his annual budget speech on Monday. The Treasury said profitable companies would be taxed at 2 percent on the money they make from UK users from April 2020, and the measure was expected to raise more than 400 million pounds ($512 million) a year. The tax will be based on self-assessment by the companies. Big internet companies, which say they follow tax rules, had previously paid little tax in Europe, typically by channelling sales via countries such as Ireland and Luxembourg which have light-touch tax regimes. Google, Facebook and Amazon have changed the way they account for their activity in Britain in recent years. In 2016, Facebook for example starting recording revenue from its UK customers supported by local sales teams, and subjecting any taxable profit on the income to UK corporation tax. However, a number of offsets meant Facebook had a tax charge for 2016 in Britain of 5.1 million pounds compared with 4.2 million pounds for 2015.  
 SLOW INTERNATIONAL PUSH The tax will target platforms such as search engines, social media and online marketplaces, Hammond said, and it will be paid by companies that generate at least 500 million pounds a year in global revenue. Britain had been leading attempts to reform international corporate tax systems, Hammond said, but progress had been painfully slow and governments could not simply talk forever. Clifford Chance tax partner Dan Neidle said the radical nature of the proposal clearly showed that Britain was becoming frustrated with the slow pace of change in global tax laws. "The UK is running ahead of every other country except Spain," he said. But given the dominance of U.S. tech giants, President Donald Trump's administration may not appreciate the proposal at a time when Britain is trying to agree new trade deals. The European Commission proposed in March that EU states would charge a 3 percent levy on digital revenues of large firms like Google and Facebook.  But the plan is opposed by smaller states like Ireland, which fears losing revenues, and by Nordic governments which think the tax could stifle innovation and trigger retaliation from the United States - the home to most of the firms which could be hit by the proposed tax. France, which supports a new levy, put forward last month the idea that such a tax would have a "sunset clause", meaning the tax would end when a global solution is found. Hammond said on Monday that if a global solution emerges, Britain would consider adopting this instead of its levy. But in the meantime, the government would consult on the detail to make sure it got its plan right, and then ensure Britain remained one of the best places to start and scale up a tech business. Amazon and Netflix declined to comment. Facebook said it looked forward to receiving more details about the proposals, and until then it was too early to comment. ($1 = 0.7814 pounds) 
 
 By Stephen Nellis Oct 30 (Reuters) - Apple Inc  on Tuesday is expected to unveil updates to its Mac computers and iPads that include facial recognition features that have been available in the iPhone lineup at an event in Brooklyn. Analysts expect a new versions of Apple's iPad Pro, its higher-end tablet computer that competes with the Microsoft Surface, with thinner bezels and more screen space, along with the face unlock system found on Apple's newer iPhones. They also expect updates to the firm's Mac lineup such as redesigned MacBook Air, Apple's$999 entry-level laptop. "They really wanted to show the world they haven't forgotten about the iPad and the Mac," said Mika Kitagawa, a senior principal research analyst at Gartner. Apple declined to comment. In July when Apple reported its most recent quarter, the company had its worst quarter of Mac sales since 2010, with unit volumes down 13 percent year over year. And iPad unit sales were up only 1 percent versus a year earlier, and revenue for both was down 5 percent from the prior year.  But some of that dip in Mac sales was explained by timing - Apple waited to release new Macs until July, when it had in previous years offered them in June. More broadly, Macs sales growth has outpaced the PC market and the iPad has been the most successful tablet in a market that simply turned out to be smaller than Apple hoped when it released the device in 2010. While Apple has held prices down on some items like its entry-level iPads for schools, analyst do not expect it to do so with iPad Pros or Mac laptops. With Mac laptops in particular, consumers increasingly use phones or tablets for quick computing tasks and only reach for a full-fledged computer when they need extra horsepower. Apple is unlikely to cut corners to drop the price of its entry-level laptops, analysts said. "With Apple, 'cheap' is always more expensive than everybody else," said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies. Apple is likely to pick a price where "you don't feel like you're breaking the bank, but you don't feel like you're compromising your experience." 
 
China steps up VPN blocks ahead of major trade, internet shows
 By Josh Horwitz HONG KONG, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Chinese authorities have stepped up efforts to block virtual private networks (VPN), service providers said on Tuesday in describing a "cat and mouse" game with censors ahead of a major trade expo and internet conference. VPNs allow internet users in China, including foreign companies, to access overseas sites that authorities bar through the so-called Great Firewall, such as Facebook Inc  and Alphabet Inc'sGoogle. "This time, the Chinese government seemed to have staff on the ground monitoring our response in real time and deploying additional blocks," said Sunday Yokubaitis, the chief executive of Golden Frog, the maker of the VyprVPN service. Authorities started blocking some of its services on Sunday, he told Reuters, although VyprVPN's service has since been restored in China. "Our counter measures usually work for a couple of days before the attack profile changes and they block us again," Yokubaitis said. The latest attacks were more aggressive than the "steadily increasing blocks" the firm had experienced in the second half of the year, he added. The Cyberspace Administration of China did not respond immediately to a faxed request from Reuters to seek comment. Another provider, ExpressVPN, also acknowledged connectivity issues on its services in China on Monday that sparked user complaints. "There has long been a cat-and-mouse game with VPNs in China and censors regularly change their blocking techniques," its spokesman told Reuters. Last year, Apple Inc  dropped a number of unapproved VPN apps from its app store in China, after Beijing adopted tighter rules. Although fears of a blanket block on services have not materialised, industry experts say VPN connections often face outages around the time of major events in China. Xi will attend a huge trade fair in Shanghai next week designed to promote China as a global importer and calm foreign concern about its trade practices, while the eastern town of Wuzhen hosts the annual World Internet Conference to showcase China's vision for internet governance.  Censors may be testing new technology that blocks VPNs more effectively, said Lokman Tsui, who studies freedom of expression and digital rights at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. "It could be just a wave of experiments," he said of the latest service disruptions. 
 
 On Oct. 26,   Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL)    iPhone XR    -- the cheapest of the three iPhones that the company announced   during its Sept. 12 product launch event -- finally hit store   shelves. Although the device doesn't include all of the bells and   whistles of its pricier siblings (the iPhone XS and iPhone XS   Max), it still has many of the key technologies that those   devices do, such as the new wide-angle camera, Face ID support,   and the crazy-fast   A12 Bionic chip    .The device is also expected to be the best-selling model of   the lot. One estimate from longtime Apple analyst Gene Munster   indicates that the iPhone XR will make up 38% of the company's   iPhone shipments during Apple's fiscal 2019 (which began on Sept.   29, 2018) -- making it, in Munster's words, "the most popular   iPhone in 2019." Incidentally, Munster's predictions call for the   iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus devices to be the second-most-popular   iPhones, capturing 28% of unit shipments.  Image source: Apple.It's highly likely that Apple will release a successor to the   iPhone XR next year. Here, I'd like to offer up some of my   predictions around what will change with the new device and what   could stay the same.I expect Apple's next iPhone XR to incorporate the typical   upgrades that we usually see with new generations of iPhones.   This should mean an upgraded applications processor, a faster   cellular subsystem, and a better rear-facing camera thanks to   improvements in the sensor and possibly the optics, as well as   the image signal processor enhancements in the new applications   processor. It also wouldn't surprise me to see upgrades to the   front-facing camera system, too.In other words, the device should be better in the ways that   you'd expect a new iPhone to be better.Additionally, you'll note that Apple launched this year's   iPhone XR in a broad array of color options: white, black, blue,   yellow, coral, and "(PRODUCT)RED." My guess is that Apple will   use the sales data of the various color options over the course   of this product cycle to determine which color options should   stick around for a subsequent iteration and which should be   swapped out for different ones.This year's iPhone XR was, in effect, an all-new phone, and   there are aspects of the company's iPhones that it maintains for   several consecutive generations. For instance, I'd imagine that   Apple won't make substantive changes to the overall form factor   and dimensions of the device. Apple also tends to reuse iPhone   displays for at least two product generations, so don't expect   any display upgrades, either.Apple currently offers the iPhone XR in three storage   configurations: 64 gigabyte (GB), 128 GB, and 256 GB. I believe   the possibility that this changes will depend on what the company   does with the successors to the higher-end iPhone XS and iPhone   XS Max. If the next-generation versions of those phones top out   at 512 GB like this year's models do, then I'd anticipate no   change to the storage configurations in the successor to the   iPhone XR.However, if the successors to the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max   come in, say, 128 GB, 512 GB, and 1 terabyte (1,024 gigabytes)   configurations, then I could see the successors to the iPhone XR   coming in 64 GB, 256 GB, and 512 GB versions.Ultimately, I expect 2019 to be an "s" year for the iPhone XR   -- mainly a specification bump. That's not necessarily a bad   thing, though, as there will certainly be a large installed base   of iPhone 6, 6s, 7, and 8 series owners that Apple will be able   to target with both iPhone XR's successor as well as today's   iPhone XR, which is likely to see a price reduction when the   newer model launches.

Sony forecasts big jump to record annual profit on winning gaming strategy
 By Makiko Yamazaki TOKYO, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Japan'sSony Corp  boosted its annual profit outlook by 30 percent to a record level after a strong second-quarter, propelled by popular game titles like "Marvel's Spider-Man" as well as growing demand for its online gaming services. The results are a vindication of a strategic shift by the  entertainment and electronics firm to build up more content-oriented businesses like gaming, which generate recurring revenue and are less susceptible to the earnings ups and downs seen in consumer electronics. Sony now expects annual operating profit of 870 billion yen ($7.7 billion), a level that comfortably beats market expectations of 796 billion yen. The gaming business will be the biggest profit driver generating 310 billion yen. Big gaming hits exclusive to Sony have offset declining sales for its mainstay PlayStation 4 console, now five years old. Action-adventure title "God of War" sold 3.1 million copies in the first three days of its release in April, the fastest sales rate of any PlayStation first-party title in history. The record was renewed just five months later, when "Marvel's Spider-Man" was released in September and sold 3.3 million in its first three days. "We've been very blessed with some blockbuster titles," Chief Financial Officer Hiroki Totoki said at an earnings briefing. "The lineup will remain strong in the second half of the year." Its PlayStation Plus subscription-based service has also seen steady growth in subscriber numbers while in the Japanese mobile gaming market, role playing game "Fate/Grand Order" published by a unit of Sony's music division continued to deliver a strong performance. In the second-quarter, operating income climbed 17 percent to 239.5 billion yen. Profit for its gaming division surged 65 percent. Sony also raised its annual profit forecast for its semiconductor division, which includes imaging sensors, by 17 percent to 140 billion yen. Although the global smartphone market is maturing, demand for Sony's image sensors has remained healthy as phone  manufacturers introduce multiple-lens camera systems for high-end models. Sony now aims to invest 600 billion yen in imaging sensors over the three years through March 2021, up by 20 percent from its previous goal and accounting for half of the group's planned capital expenditures. Sony controls more than half of the imaging sensor market for smartphones, with customers including Apple Inc  and most other major handset makers. Meanwhile, Sony's own smartphone handset business was one of few weak spots in the robust earnings as the firm is now bracing for a loss of 95 billion yen for this financial year and expects the business to return to profit only in the year from April 2020. "We'll scale down the business further to minimise risks," Totoki said, but added that the company had no intention of exiting the business entirely. Also on Tuesday, domestic gaming peer Nintendo Co Ltd  said sales of Switch consoles and games pushed operating profit up 30 percent in the July-September period to reach the firm's highest quarterly result in eight years.

  Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL)  market capitalization   recently hit $1 trillion    , which naturally leads to the follow-up question of whether the   iconic brand has reached its ceiling or will continue to add   trillions of dollars more to its market value over the long   term.Over the last decade, the growth of the iPhone is largely   responsible for driving    Apple stock    up 1,500% to reach that milestone. But over the last few years,   smartphone unit sales have started to dramatically slow down,   which could severely limit the company's growth potential.Given that the Cupertino, California-based company is still   heavily dependent on iPhone sales, what does this mean for Apple   going forward? Can the stock still make you a millionaire if you   buy the stock? Let's find out.  Apple Watch Series 4. IMAGE SOURCE: APPLE.Apple isn't growing at quite the torrid pace it did several   years ago when the iPhone and iPad were relatively new products   on the market. The smartphone market has dramatically slowed over   the last few years, which reflects a slowing pace of innovation,   a lengthening replacement cycle, and a potentially saturated   market. This has made it more challenging for Apple to grow   the top line since the iPhone currently makes up 64% of   revenue.        AAPL    data by   YCharts But despite low single-digit growth in iPhone unit sales this   year, Apple has managed to deliver strong revenue growth as   management shifts its strategy to increasing selling prices and   growing its services category. Through the first three   quarters of fiscal 2018, higher selling prices for the iPhone X   helped drive a 15% increase in Apple's total revenue.Further boosting Apple's top line is a huge installed base of   1.3 billion devices (as of the first quarter of fiscal 2018),   which is beginning to translate to growing demand for services,   including Apple Pay, Apple Music, AppleCare, apps, and iCloud   storage plans.Revenue from services grew 30% year over year through the   first three quarters of fiscal 2018 and made up 20% of Apple's   revenue. Management expects services to reach $50 billion in   annual revenue by fiscal 2020 -- double the amount generated in   fiscal 2016.Specifically within services, the Mac maker has a huge   opportunity in mobile payments since its Apple Pay service works   seamlessly across all of its devices and operating systems. In   the last quarter alone, Apple Pay processed over 1 billion   transactions, which is triple the amount from the year-ago   quarter. One analyst estimated that Apple Pay has 253 million   users worldwide, which puts Apple neck-and-neck with   PayPal Holdings     -- one of the leaders in digital payments, which has 254   million users and a market cap of about $100 billion.In addition to mobile payments, Apple is beginning to put the   pieces together for a possible streaming service through Apple TV   that could be worth $37 billion    , according to one analyst. Apple saw strong growth in Apple   TV after updating the device for 4K video resolution a year   ago.Investors should also be aware of   Apple's ambitions in self-driving cars    , which is an exciting moonshot opportunity. We know Apple   is testing autonomous cars, but it's unclear whether Apple is   thinking about the software side or going full throttle with an   Apple-branded car of its own.Given Apple's knack over the years for creating products that   are beloved by hundreds of millions of users and given that the   car is gradually becoming the computer of the future, I wouldn't   doubt Apple's ability to make a big splash in the automotive   market over the next decade. If there was one company that could   bring a fresh perspective on what an autonomous car could be, it   would be Apple.Apple's stock is up 41% over the last year and 196% over the   last five years. Strong share-price gains have been fueled   by robust quarterly performance lately. In the third quarter,   revenue was up 17%, and earnings per share soared 40% year over   year. Those numbers certainly have millionaire-making   potential, but...These results may not last for long. While Apple can keep   iPhone revenue growing robustly in the near term with strong   price increases, the recent 19.5% increase in average selling   prices for iPhone in the third quarter is unsustainable. At   that rate of growth, consumers would be spending more than $4,000   for an iPhone in 10 years.Given that unlikelihood, average selling-price growth should   gravitate down to the single digits over the long term. Analysts   estimate Apple will grow earnings about 12% per year over the   next five years, which seems to fit this scenario. Slowing   iPhone revenue growth should be compensated by the faster-growing   services category, which all together should leave enough growth   to deliver solid gains for shareholders.It probably won't make you a millionaire, but Apple shares   should keep marching higher over the long term.  10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Earnings: Can Apple's Strong Momentum Persist?
  Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) has a high bar to live up to this week. The   company reports financial results for its fourth quarter of   fiscal 2018 on Thursday, following seven consecutive   quarters of accelerating year-over-year revenue growth   rates. Adding even more pressure, Apple guided for strong   double-digit revenue growth in Q4.Of course, there's good reason to expect solid results from   the tech giant. Not only has iPhone revenue been growing nicely,   but Apple has been seeing high growth rates from its services and   "other products" segments. The strong momentum at its back has   indeed raised expectations, helping propel the tech giant's stock   more than 30% higher over the last 12 months.Going into Apple's fourth-quarter results this week, here's an   overview of some of the key areas to watch.  Image source: Apple.Combining Apple's strong 17% year-over-year increase in   revenue growth in Q3 and management's guidance for 14% to   18% revenue growth in Q4, investors should expect more   strong revenue growth in that period. Lately, Apple's quarterly   revenue has trended toward the high end of management's revenue   guidance, so investors should look for about 16% or greater   revenue growth.With the iPhone accounting for approximately 56% of Apple's   revenue, total revenue will be largely driven by the   company's smartphone sales. To achieve 16% revenue growth, iPhone   revenue will likely need to rise at a similarly strong rate or   better.Apple's earnings per share have seen outsize growth recently   thanks to the company's   aggressive share repurchase program    . This trend should persist in Q4. Look for earnings per share to   come in around $2.70 to $2.80, representing 30% to 35%   year-over-year growth.Now Apple's second-largest business segment, services have   become integral to the tech giant's growth story. Including   revenue from the App Store, iTunes, and AppleCare, Apple's   services business has been growing exceptionally fast. Services   revenue soared 31% year over year in Apple's third quarter.With Apple's App Store (one of the segment's biggest   contributors) firing on all cylinders, there's no reason to   expect this catalyst to slow down. Investors should look for more   year-over-year growth around 30% in Q4.Another key segment worth calling out is Apple's "other   products" business. Sure, it's Apple's smallest segment,   accounting for about 7% of revenue, but it's also the tech   giant's fastest-growing segment. Sales of Apple Watch and   AirPods, in particular, are driving sharp growth in the   segment."Our third highlight of the quarter is the outstanding results   in wearables," Apple CEO Tim Cook said in the company's   third-quarter earnings call    , "which comprises Apple Watch, AirPods, and Beats, and was up   over 60% year over year with growth accelerating from the March   quarter."Look for year-over-year revenue growth from the segment in   line with the 37% growth other products saw in Q3.Finally, investors will want to tune into Apple's revenue   guidance for its fiscal first quarter of 2019. Benefitting from   the holiday season and Apple's annual iPhone refresh, this   quarter is seasonally Apple's biggest. Given the strength of   Apple's fiscal first quarter of 2018, investors should expect   guidance for more double-digit revenue growth. In addition,   investors should look for more year-over-year growth, albeit at a   decelerated rate of around 5%. This would translate to guidance   for first-quarter revenue of about $92.5 billion.Apple reports its fourth-quarter financial results after   market close on Thursday, Nov. 1.

Intel says more women, blacks in workforce after diversity push
 By Jane Lanhee Lee SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Intel Corp  has increased the ratio of women and African-Americans in its workforce after three years of a high-profile effort to improve diversity, the U.S. microchip maker said in a report released on Monday. Intel still lags behind several large U.S. technology companies in terms of women and ahead of many for African Americans and Hispanics, the report showed. Chronic underrepresentation of minorities has been a source of concern for years at tech companies. The percentage of African Americans at Intel has risen to nearly 5 percent from 3.5 percent in 2015 and Hispanics rose to 9.2 percent from 8.3 percent. "Although we are among the leaders in African American representation in the tech industry, we are still not satisfied," Barbara Whye, Intel's chief diversity and inclusion officer said by email. The company will continue to work with historically black colleges and the Oakland Unified School District in California, she added. Without providing figures, Intel said it had reached "full representation" two years ahead of its goal based on skilled minorities in the available workforce. In 2015, Intel established a $300 million fund to be used by 2020 to improve diversity. Whitesmake up 46.2 percent of the workforce at the company, and Asians 38.9 percent, according to Intel. Intel's African American 2018 representation was better than at Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc, and Microsoft Corp, according to the companies' latest data. But its female representation was behind Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc , and only ahead of Microsoft. 
 
  Cirrus Logic, Inc. CRUS  is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2019 results on Nov 1. The company beat estimates twice in the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 89.31%.        Cirrus Logic, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise    |      Cirrus Logic, Inc. Quote However, the top line declined 20.7% year over year in spite of outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line also declined 65.4% due to lower revenues and higher operating expenses.    For the fiscal second quarter the company projects revenues between $310 million and $350 million.    Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.   Factors to Consider    Cirrus Logic's focus on execution, expansion of customer base and efforts to capitalize on rising demand for powerful audio and voice components are expected to show results in the to-be reported quarter.    Of late, Cirrus Logic has been witnessing an increase in design wins in the Android market.    Moreover, the company's strengthening product portfolio, aimed at a variety of smart home applications, digital headsets and smartphones, is a positive. Audio amplifier design wins along with lead design win with first generation haptic products and discussions in progress with customers for second generation products are encouraging.    Nonetheless, according to the company's most recent annual report, 81% of revenues came from sales of sound technology to Apple AAPL  . We have earlier seen that sluggish demand for smartphones, especially iPhone X, led to production cuts, which took a toll on Cirrus, reflecting in its quarterly results. This is expected to remain an overhang on the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well.    Moreover, as the sluggishness in the smartphone market continues, the top line is likely to stay under pressure in the fiscal second quarter.    Furthermore, the U.S.-China trade war has sharply affected the semiconductor market in general. Being a supplier of fabless semiconductors, we believe that this will keep Cirrus Logic's revenues under pressure.   What the Zacks Model Says    According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP  . Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.    Cirrus Logic has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

I don't know what it is about October that spooks markets, but it certainly feels like big market corrections happen in the month. As stocks have gone through contortions this month, more down than up, like many of you, I have been looking at my portfolio, wondering whether this is the crash that the market bears have been warning me about since 2012, just a pause in a continuing bull market or perhaps a prognosticator of economic troubles to come.If you are expecting me to give you the answer in this post, I would stop reading, since reading market tea leaves is not my strength. That said, I have been wrestling with what, if anything, I should be doing, as an investor, in response to the market movements. As in previous market crises, I find myself going back to a four-step process that I hope gets me through with my sanity intact.The first casualty of crisis is good sense, as I mistake my panic response for instinct, and almost every action that I feel the urge to take in the heat of the moment is driven by fear and greed, not reason. No amount of rational thinking or studying behavioral finance will cure me of this affliction, since it is part of my make up as a human being, but there are three things that I find help me manage my reactions:In an age of instant analysis and expert opinion, it is easy to get a skewed view of not only what is causing the market damage, but also where that damage is greatest. In my (limited) reading of market analyses during the last four weeks, I have seen at least a half a dozen hypotheses about the stock swoon, from it being the Fed's fault (as usual) to a long overdue tech company correction to it being a response to global crises (in Italy and Saudi Arabia). In keeping with the old adage of "trust, but verify", I decided to take a look at the data to see if there are answers in it to these questions.1.The Fed's fault?As those of you who read my blog know well, I believe that the Fed has far less power than we think it does to set interest rates , but it is a convenient bogeyman. One explanation for the stock drop that has been making the rounds is that it is fear that Fed will raise rates too quickly in the future, that is causing stocks to swoon. Is that a plausible story? Yes, but if it is the reason for the market decline, you would have a difficult time explaining the movement in interest rates during October 2018:As stocks have gone through their pains since October 1, treasury bill and bond rates have remained steady, which would make little sense if the expectation is that they will rise in the near future. After all, if investors expect rates to rise soon, those rates will start going up now and not on cue, when the Fed acts.There is the possibility that this could be a delayed reaction to rates having gone up over the year already, with the 10-year treasury bond rate moving from 2.41% at the start of the year to 3.06% at the start of October 2018 and to a flattening yield curve (which has historically been a precursor to slower economic growth). Note though, that much of this movement in interest rates happened in the first six months of the year and you would need a reason for why stock prices would be moving four months later.2. A Tech Meltdown?My view, based upon what I had been hearing and reading, and before I looked at the data, was that the October 2018 stock drop was being caused by tech companies, in general, and the large tech companies, especially the FANG+Apple combination, specifically. To see if this is true, I looked at the returns on all US stocks, classified by sectors (as defined by S&P), in October, in the year to date and for 1-year and 5-year time periods.I know that the S&P sector classifications are imperfect, but my priors seem to be wrong. While information technology, as a group, lost 8.76% of aggregate market capitalization in October 2018, the three worst sectors in the US market were energy, industrials and materials , all of which lost much more, in percentage terms, than technology. In fact, the two sectors that did the best were consumer staples and utilities, with the latter's performance also providing evidence that it is not interest rate fears that are primarily driving this market correction.I have argued that, unlike two decades ago, technology companies now are now a diverse group, and many of them don't fit the "high growth, high risk" profile that people seem to still automatically give all tech companies. Using the terminology of corporate life cycles , tech companies run the gamut from old tech to middle-aged tech to young tech, and I have looked at how tech companies in each age grouping in the graph below (age is defined, relative to year of founding):The median percentage change, in both October 2018 and YTD 2018, in market capitalization was greatest at the youngest tech companies. The median percentage change becomes smaller for older tech companies, in October 2018, but the effect for the four highest age classes is more mixed for the YTD numbers. That said, a much smaller median percentage change at the largest tech companies has a much biggest effect on the market, because of the market capitalization of these companies. That is the reason I look at the FANG stocks and Apple ( AAPL ) in the table below:While the percentage change in stock prices at these companies is in line with the market drop, if Apple is included in the mix, the five companies collectively lost a staggering $276 billion in market capitalization between October 1 and October 26. accounting for almost 11.7% of the overall drop in market capitalization of US stocks.While investors in these stocks may feel merited in complaining about their losses, I would draw their attention to the third column, where I look at what these stocks have done since January 1, 2018, with the losses in October incorporated. Collectively, these five companies have added almost $521 billion in market capitalization since the start of the year, and without them, the overall market would have been down substantially.3. A Correction in Overvalued Stocks?For some value investors who have argued that investors were pushing up some stocks to unsustainable levels, the market correction has been vindication, a sign that the market is correcting its pricing mistakes and marking down the stocks that it had over priced the most. That may be plausible, and to see if it holds, I broke all US stocks, at the start of October, based upon PE ratios into six groupings (low to high PE and a separate one for negative earnings companies):If the selective correction argument is correct, you should expect to see the highest PE ratio and negative earnings companies drop the most in value and the companies with the lowest PE ratios be less affected. While negative earnings stocks have seen the market correction, during October 2018, there is no pattern across the other PE classes. In fact, the lowest PE ratio companies had the second worst record, in terms of price performance, among the groupings.4. A US Problem?One of the lessons of the last decade is that much as countries would like to disconnect from the rest of the world and chart their own pathway to economic prosperity, they are joined at the hip by globalization, with crisis in one part of the world quickly affecting economies and markets in other parts. In October 2018, we had our share of global shocks, with the standoff between Italy and the EU and Saudi Arabia's Khashoggi problem taking top billing. To see how the market correction has played out in world markets, I broke global markets down into broad regional groupings and arrived at the following:Note that these returns are all in US dollars, reflecting both the performance of the market and the currencies of each region. Asia seems to have been hit the worst this month, with China, Small Asia (South East Asia, Pakistan, Bangladesh) and Japan all seeing double digit declines in aggregate market capitalization. Latin America has had the best performance of the regional groupings, with the election surprise in Brazil driving its markets upwards during the month.The year-to-date numbers do tell a bigger story that has been glossed over in analysis. For much of 2018, the US market & economy has diverged from the rest of the globe, posting solid numbers (prior to October) whereas the rest of the world was struggling. It is possible that we are seeing an end to that divergence, suggesting that the US markets will move more closely with the other global markets going forward.5. Panic Attack?One of the more striking features of the markets during October 2018 has been that the stock market retreat, while substantial, has, for the most part, been orderly. In a panic-driven stock market sell off, you usually see a surge in government bond prices (and a drop in rates), a general flight to quality (US $ and safer companies) and a rise in the price of gold . As we noted in the earlier section, the market drop does not seem to be smaller at larger and more profitable companies, and government bond rates have not dropped. In addition, while the US dollar has had a strong year so far, especially against emerging market currencies, it generally did not see a flight to it in October 2018:The dollar strengthened mildly against almost every currency during the month, and the only currency where there was a big move was against the Brazilian Real, where it weakened, again on political news in Brazil. Note again that the market correction may be, at least partly, a delayed reaction to the strength of the US dollar leading into October, but the timing is still difficult to explain. Finally, I looked at gold prices in October 2018, in conjunction with bitcoin, since the latter has been promoted as millennial gold:It has been a good month for gold, with prices up 4.44%, though there is little sign of panic buying pushing up prices. It may be a little unfair to be passing judgment on Bitcoin, after one crisis, but if it is millennial gold, either millennials are unaware that there is a stock market sell off or they do not care.With the assessment of market pain behind us, we can turn to looking at the fundamentals, again looking for clues in why stocks have had such a tough month. While almost every factor affects stock prices, the effects have to show up in one of four places for fundamental value to change significantly: a shock to base year earnings or cash flows, a change in expected earnings/cash flow growth, a increase in the risk free rate or a change in the price of risk:Since treasury bond rates have been stable through much of the month, I am going to look at one of the other three variables as the potential culprit.On the cash flow front, there were no high profile cessations of buybacks or dividends, and all signs point to the market delivering and perhaps beating the earnings and cash flows that we have estimated for 2018.
 If cash flows and expected growth have not changed over the month, the price of equity risk has jumped from 5.38% at the start of the month to the 5.89% on October 26, putting it at the high end of equity risk premiums in the last decade.You could attribute the higher equity risk premiums to global crises (in Italy and Saudi Arabia) but that would be a reach since the increase in risk premiums predates both crises. If you do lower expected earnings growth going forward, perhaps reflecting a delayed response to the stronger dollar and higher rates, the equity risk premium will drop.In fact, halving the expected growth rate from 2019 on from the current estimate of 7.29% to 4.71% (the compounded average annual earnings growth rate over the last 10 years) reduces the equity risk premium to 5.28%, but even that number is a healthy one, relative to historic norms. The bottom line is that, at least by my calculations, I am estimating an equity risk premium that seems fair, given macro and micro fundamentals and my risk preferences.One of the biggest perils of being reactive in a crisis is that it can knock you off your investment game and cause you to abandon your core philosophy. I don't believe that there is one investment philosophy that is right for every one, but I do believe that there is one that is right for you, and shifting away from it is a recipe for bad results. I am a "value" investor, though my definition of value is different from old-time value investing in two ways:Given my philosophy and a reading of the data, here is what I plan to do.Please note that this is not meant to be investment advice and your path back to investment serenity may be very different from mine!See also The Power Of Bitcoin Doubling Rates on seekingalpha.com
  Qorvo    (NASDAQ: QRVO) investors may finally have a solid reason to   celebrate. The chipmaker was   on shaky ground    this time last year thanks to intense competition among   smartphone chip suppliers: Its mobile revenue was falling, and   the emerging   Internet of Things    (IoT) business wasn't big enough to make up for the smartphone   weakness.But   things took a turn for the better    in August when Qorvo posted its first-quarter results. The   chipmaker's revenue shot up in the mid-teens on the back of 7%   growth in the mobile business. Coupled with solid growth in the   infrastructure and defense products business (IDP), which   increased 13% year over year, Qorvo's top line thumped past Wall   Street estimates.The good part: Qorvo looks all set to repeat that performance   when it releases its second-quarter results on Oct. 31.  Image Source: Getty ImagesQorvo was losing ground at key customer   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) last year. Rival chipmakers   Skyworks    and   Broadcom    had scored the majority of the radio frequency chip spots at   Cupertino, denting Qorvo's business as it relied on Apple for a   third of its total revenue. But the tables have turned.Qorvo has   scored a win    in the latest iPhone XR by displacing rival Broadcom. It is   believed that Apple went with Qorvo this time to keep a   handle on the production costs of the "cheapest" iPhone in its   lineup. Instinet analyst Romit Shah said the switch could help   Apple cut component costs to the tune of $100 million, and   add $300 million to Qorvo's top line during the second half of   2018.The iPhone XR is expected to command a 50% share in the   production mix of the new iPhones. The accessible pricing of this   model has piqued interest from users looking to upgrade from   previous generation iPhones; as such, supply chain sources are   predicting a higher proportion of iPhone XR orders both this   year and in early 2019.Qorvo pulled in $1.66 billion in revenue during the   second half of calendar 2017, so an additional $300 million would   increase that amount by 18%.And since the company gets 70% of its revenue from the   mobile business, it shouldn't be surprising if Qorvo's sales   growth is higher than the 4.4% and 6.7% annual jumps   anticipated by analysts for the quarters ending in September and   December, respectively.However, the upswing in the mobile business is not the only   catalyst for Qorvo that investors should be watching.We have already seen that Qorvo's IDP business recorded   impressive growth last quarter. The good news is that this   business won't be running out of steam anytime soon, as it   includes fast-growing verticals within the IoT space. In fact,   Qorvo claims that IoT-related revenue within the IDP business   shot up 30% year over year during the first quarter, driven   by the increasing demand for its filters across connected homes   and connected cars.Qorvo has now strengthened its IoT footprint by launching a   new platform to target the fast-growing smart-home market. The   company launched a new, integrated chip package last month   that supports multiple smart-home connectivity protocols. OEMs   (original equipment manufacturers) can deploy this chip package   in their smart-home devices to boost signal range, reduce power   consumption, and reduce their time to market.According to Mordor Intelligence, smart homes occupied   a 14% revenue share of the IoT chip market at the end of   last year. Looking ahead, the IoT chip market is expected to grow   at an annual rate of 13.5% through 2023, while the   smart-home market could grow at a faster compound annual growth   rate of nearly 26%. Analysts believe that the semiconductor industry is moving   toward a cyclical slowdown thanks to weak chip demand and an   increase in inventory levels that is creating an oversupply. But   Qorvo has solid short- and long-term catalysts to offset weakness   in the chip industry.The company has struggled to grow its bottom line in the   past five years, but that's not going to be the case anymore --   Qorvo's earnings are forecast to increase at an annual   rate of nearly 13% for the next five years. This makes Qorvo   an enticing investment, as it is valued at just 10 times   forward earnings.  10 stocks we like better than Qorvo       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Personal Income And Spending Brought Modestly Positive Numbers
Data processing firm Red HatRHT shares are up nearly 50% at this hour of today's pre-market upon the announcement that it has agreed to be acquired by IBMIBM for $34 billion. The deal between these two long-term partners comes at a 63% premium on Red Hat shares, with the goal, according to IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, is to make IBM the #1 hybrid cloud provider.IBM has fallen behind its mega-tech peers in recent times, as its forays into Watson technologies went from IBM leading the market in "smart" tech to being an also-ran in just a few short years. Such is the pace of technological development in the current era. With Red Hat's synergies, IBM believes it can fast-track its growth in the hybrid cloud space. IBM shares are down nearly 20% year to date, including another 5% drop upon this acquisition announcement.Personal Income and Spending  for September brought modestly positive numbers early this Monday morning, with Income missing estimates by 20 basis points to +0.2%, also lower than the upwardly revised read from the previous month of +0.4%. Consumer Spending  stayed strong, up 0.4% and still a notch below the upwardly-revised 0.5% from August.Core Inflation  double expectations to +0.2% last month, and up from the 0.0% we saw in August. Following Friday's initial read on Q3 GDP coming in less than robust beneath the headline +3.5%, we had been on the lookout for spots of weakness in economic data that may cause the Fed to re-think raising interest rates at its upcoming December meeting. We see no such weakness in this data.This is also another big week for Q3 earnings results, with expected reports later this week from AppleAAPL , FacebookFB and others. Ahead of today's opening bell, we see several more results, including:Cooper Tire & Rubber CTB reported a mixed Q3 today, with a big beat on the bottom line - $1.07 per share versus 45 cents expected (though down from $1.18 per share in the year-ago quarter) - but a 1.3% miss on the top, to $733.8 million in quarterly sales. The Zacks Rank #3 company currently trades at multi-year lows. For more on CTB's earnings, click here.ON Semiconductor ON outperformed estimates on both top and bottom lines this morning, posting 57 cents per share which beat the Zacks consensus by 7 cents, on $1.54 billion in sales which beat analysts' expectations by 2%. Shares are up nearly 9.8% following the earnings report, but the stock is still down more than 20% year to date.

 By Shreyashi   Sanyal Oct 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes rose on Monday, as gains in auto stocks, a recovery in tech company stocks and relief over an unchanged sovereign rating on Italy helped a rebound from last week's steep global selloff. Carmaker Ford Motor Co  rose 6.2 percent, while General Motors Co  gained 4.5 percent after Bloomberg reported China was planning to cut the tax levied on car purchases by half.  The two sectors house four of the five high-growth FAANG stocks. Facebook Inc, Apple Inc, Netflix Inc  and Alphabet GOOGL.O were up between 1.2 percent and 2.2 percent. Amazon.com Inc, part of consumer discretionary and another stock hit heavily by unusually shaky tech results last week, was trading flat. Wall Street has been rocked by jitters over geopolitical events as well as fears over tariffs, rising wages and borrowing costs, putting the benchmark S&P 500  on track for its worst monthly performance since May 2010. "Investors are coming in today from an oversold market last week," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York. "Markets are set to have a positive reaction to any form of good news." Relief over Italy dodging a ratings downgrade helped global sentiment and overturned an earlier fall in U.S. stock futures due to data showing China's industrial profit growth slowed for a fifth straight month in September. The slowdown in China, a major source of income for several American companies, has been a concern this earnings season, with a slew of corporates from industrials to chipmakers giving discouraging forecasts. While healthy third-quarter results have pushed up third-quarter profit estimates at S&P companies to 25.2 percent from 21.8 percent in the past 10 days, dour forecast have pulled down the current-quarter's growth outlook to 19.5 percent from 19.9 percent, according to Refinitiv data. At 10:08 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was up 340.01 points, or 1.38 percent, at 25,028.32, the S&P 500  was up 1.6 percent at and the Nasdaq Composite  was up 122.49 points, or 1.71 percent, at 7,289.71. Also offering support was data that showed U.S. consumer spending for September rising in line with expectations and income recording its smallest gain in more than a year, suggesting a moderation in spending in the future.  Shares of IBM Corp  fell nearly 2 percent after the company agreed to buy software company Red Hat Inc  for $34 billion. Red Hat shares soared 47 percent.  Tesla Inc  rose 2.5 percent as the Times reported that the electric carmaker's third largest shareholder, Baillie Gifford & Co, would be willing to inject more cash in the company.

Rio Tinto sees new-style partnerships as the future
 By Barbara Lewis LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Mining companies must forge new ties with partners from customers to governments as they pursue innovation and compete for talent with technology giants, Rio Tinto's,  chief executive said in a speech to be delivered on Tuesday. The mining industry has recovered from the deep commodity crash of 2015-16, but faces headwinds from U.S.-China trade tensions, which have dented the copper price, and is struggling to win investor trust. "New forms of partnering won't be just about governments, society and communities. It will also be about partnerships with customers, suppliers and even, competitors," he will say. He flagged in the speech Rio's ties with Apple - with which, together with Alcoa, it announced a partnership to make emissions-free aluminium in May - as "an example of competitors working together to advance the future". Partnerships could also help companies secure breakthroughs such as self-steering ships to transport materials, Jacques said, adding the technology may not be far off. Rio Tinto is already using massive driverless trains to transport iron ore in the Pilbara region of Australia, which it says can deliver efficiencies as well as improving safety. The project has however been years in the making and suffered delays.  Jacques said mining had an image problem as "one of the least trusted on the planet". As digitalisation takes hold, it needs to compete with technology giants, as well as other miners, to win talent. Investor trust was eroded during the commodity boom years when miners overspent on projects that may never deliver shareholder returns.  Institutional investors, which focus on environmental, social and governance issues, have also been made cautious by the exposure of miners to fossil fuel and by corruption allegations. Rio Tinto has previously pushed the idea that partnerships can enhance rather than dilute value and could help to fend off a rising tide of resource nationalism as some governments seek a bigger share of profits from mining.  "If a community or government wants a bigger share of the pie, they may need to be willing to take on more of the risk," Jacques said, according to the copy of the speech. "As an industry, perhaps, it is time to think about a different business model - where we provide mining as a service and let other people finance projects that need billions in upfront investment before the benefits can be shared."

 By Trevor Hunnicutt and Paresh Dave Oct 28 (Reuters) - Gab.com, the website where the suspected Pittsburgh synagogue gunman posted anti-Semitic views, said on Sunday it was offline for a period of time after being asked by its domain provider to move to another registrar. The move comes after GoDaddy Inc  asked Gab to change the domain, while PayPal Holdings Inc, Stripe Inc and Joynet Inc blocked the website. The 46-year-old suspect Robert Bowers in the shooting incident has been charged with murdering 11 people on Saturday in the deadliest attack ever on the Jewish community in the United States. Hours earlier, he posted on Gab.com, saying a non-profit that helps refugees relocate to the country was helping to kill "my people." "Gab.com is under attack. We have been systematically no-platformed by App Stores, multiple hosting providers, and several payment processors," the website said, adding that it was working around the clock to get Gab.com back online. PayPal banned the website from using its money-sending services on Saturday. Gab said on Saturday it received notice it would be blocked by another payments website, Stripe Inc, and had switched to a new web-hosting service after Joyent Inc warned it would cut off the website. Gab did not say who the new web host was. The company posted on Twitter on Sunday, "FREE SPEECH WILL ALWAYS WIN." Founded in 2016 by conservative Andrew Torba, Gab bills itself as the "free speech" alternative to Twitter Inc  and Facebook Inc  and has become a popular place to post content unwelcome or prohibited on other platforms. Bowers, 46, joined the site in January. Notable users include right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos and Andrew Anglin, the founder of the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website, as well as media personalities Alex Jones and Carl Benjamin. The free website charges for access to additional features and also raises money on the crowdfunding website StartEngine. Torba did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday. Utsav Sanduja, Gab's former chief operating officer, said the company and its mission will survive "guilt by association" and could do more fundraising through cryptocurrencies in order to bypass tech companies. "We created Gab for the purpose of letting off steam not to kill. That was not our intention," he said. In earlier statements, the website said it was cooperating with law enforcement authorities and described the moves by PayPal and others as acts of "direct collusion between big tech giants." It also called on U.S. President Donald Trump to act. PayPal declined to comment beyond an earlier statement that the company takes immediate action when "a site is allowing the perpetuation of hate, violence or discriminatory intolerance." Joyent could not immediately be reached, and Stripe declined to comment on individual users. Sanduja did say that there could be room for Gab to improve. "The mission should not change, but certainly there does need to be better checks and balances in place," he said. Sanduja said he left his role at the website in June after Gab users threatened his life and that of his wife, who works at a synagogue. On Sunday, Gab's forum lit up with comments about the Pittsburgh attack. One user celebrated Gab being banned by PayPal while another user responded, "You are going to get shot at ur local synagogue." Another posted, "I WAS RIGHT, THEY FAKED THE SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING." Gab raised $1 million through crowdfunding last year, but recorded a loss of $201,704, according to a document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Microsoft Corp  said in an emailed statement that it terminated Gab's accounts on its Azure cloud computing platform last month. Alphabet Inc'sGoogle and Apple Inc's  mobile app stores previously blocked Gab, cutting off a crucial source of access to new users. Facebook's archive of ads that it considers political in nature shows Gab has run only one such ad since May. It paid less than $100 for that ad and generated 1,000 to 5,000 views last month, according to the archive. The company had no active ad campaigns on Facebook or Twitter Inc as of Saturday, according to those companies' ad transparency databases. Gab's account on Twitter warned users on Saturday to expect that they would be banned from that website and Facebook soon. A Facebook spokeswoman said the company is reviewing Gab's presence on its website. Twitter declined to comment.

Why the iPad's Fate Shouldn't Matter Much to Apple Investors
 Later this month,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) is expected to introduce updated versions of its   iPad Pro tablets. The devices are expected to be radically   redesigned compared to their predecessors, sporting screens with   dramatically smaller bezels and the elimination of   Touch ID    (and the home button) in favor of the company's facial   recognition technology, known as Face ID, that first made its   debut in   last year's iPhone X    .The devices will certainly get a lot of press. Frankly,   they'll probably be great products that could give the company's   iPad business a boost in the coming quarters. However, before   getting   too    excited about these new iPads and the effect that they could have   on the business, it's helpful to have an understanding of just   how   unimportant    the iPad product category is to Apple's overall financial   performance.  Image source: Apple.Apple's iPad business peaked during the company's fiscal year   2013, with unit shipments totaling more than 71 million and sales   coming within spitting distance of $32 billion. That year, the   iPad made up roughly 18.7% of the company's annual revenue.In the years that followed, though, Apple's iPad business   suffered a string of unit shipment and revenue declines. When   Apple turned in its fiscal year 2017 results, it reported that it   sold just under 43.8 million iPads, generating $19.2 billion in   revenue along the way. Apple's iPad business made up just under   8.4% of the company's revenue in that year.While Apple doesn't report its full fiscal year 2018 results   until Nov. 1, the iPad business became even less important during   the first three quarters of the year. Even though Apple reported   a 2% rise in iPad revenue during that time, Apple's overall   revenue grew at a more robust 15% rate, thanks to the iPhone   business delivering 15% revenue growth, services turning in 27%   growth, and sales of "other products" (including the Apple Watch,   AirPods, HomePod, and so on) surging 37%.iPad made up just under 7.3% of the company's revenue in the   first three quarters of fiscal year 2018, down from the more than   8.1% that it accounted for in the first three quarters of the   company's fiscal year 2017.As a consolation prize, iPad wasn't the slowest-growing of   Apple's businesses during that time -- that honor went to the   company's Mac business, which saw revenue shrink 3% in the first   three quarters of fiscal year 2018. (That being said, Apple's Mac   business still brought in more absolute revenue than the iPad   business did.)It should go without saying that Apple is better off having   its nearly $20 billion in annual iPad revenue than not having it.   The iPad is also an important part of Apple's overall computing   ecosystem. That's why investors should expect Apple to keep   investing in building new iPad hardware, cultivating the iPad app   ecosystem, and working to increase adoption of the iPad across   various industries.If Apple can keep the iPad business at least flat, then it   wouldn't detract from the revenue growth that its other   businesses deliver. And if Apple can actually put this business   on a growth track -- even if that growth is modest -- that would   be even better.With that all being said, I just don't think the performance   of the iPad business is, or should be, at the forefront of   investors' minds -- nor should it affect anyone's long-term   outlook on the company.  10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

  Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) is one of the most iconic brands in the world. Its   strong ecosystem of services and hardware has made the company   one of the most valuable in the world with a $1 trillion market   capitalization. All told, it's one of the most followed   companies by investors and consumers alike. Even with all of that   attention, there are some interesting aspects of Apple's business   that many people may not be aware of.Here are five things you may not know about this household   name.  IMAGE SOURCE: APPLE.As of the first quarter of fiscal 2018, Apple had a growing   installed base of 1.3 billion active devices around the   world. Additionally, during the recent event to announce the   new iPhone XS, CEO Tim Cook mentioned that Apple was close to   shipping its 2 billionth iOS device. He also mentioned that   over 500 million people visit an Apple Store every year.Apple generated $8 billion in revenue from sales of gaming   apps in its App Store in 2017, according to industry researcher   Newzoo. Only two companies in the world generate more   revenue from games than Apple: Chinese social media giant   Tencent Holdings     and   Sony    's Playstation. This means Apple is technically a bigger   game company than leading game makers like   Activision Blizzard     and   Electronic Arts    .What's more, Apple may remain ahead of the top game makers   considering that mobile game sales are the fastest-growing   category of video game sales.The conception of the iPhone was not a sudden stroke of genius   by Steve Jobs. Instead, it was a slow process of cobbling   together different ideas and projects that Apple was working on   in 2005. In fact, Apple was already getting to work on   making what would become the iPad when Jobs steered Apple's   engineers to make a phone.As early as 2003, Apple's lead designer Jony Ive and his team   were already toying with the idea of using multitouch screens on   Mac computers. It wasn't until a few years later that Ive   showed the technology to Jobs, which sparked the idea to marry a   multitouch screen with a phone.Given that Apple designs its own hardware and software,   including its own processor    for its iPhone, iPad, and Watch, you might think it never   makes any acquisitions. But it does. Its $2.6 billion acquisition   of Beats Music in 2014 was much publicized and enhanced the   technological capabilities behind Apple's music streaming   service.The same year Apple bought Beats, the company spent an   additional $957 million buying small companies that work on   specific technologies. Since fiscal 2008, Apple has spent a total   of $7.1 billion on acquisitions.Some of the transactions can give a heads-up on certain   features Apple is getting ready to introduce. For example, in   early 2017, Apple acquired Realface -- a cybertechnology start-up   in Israel working on facial recognition. Face ID made its   debut on the iPhone X months later.Apple's latest acquisition of the popular music app Shazam --   which can detect which song is playing around the listener -- may   foreshadow significant enhancements coming to Apple's music   streaming service in the months ahead.Apple will continue to make its iPhones and Macs, but other   revenue channels could blossom over the next decade. Currently,   Apple generates most of its revenue from the iPhone, but   that could change considering what it's working on.First up, there have been various reports of Apple testing   self-driving cars. But since it hasn't talked about its   plans, it's anyone's guess what the company is up to. What   we know is that self-driving cars are expected to be a big trend   that could revolutionize the $4.8 trillion transportation   sector over the next few decades. Apple has kept its cards   close to its vest, but the company   seems to have a plan to get in on the action    .The second big growth opportunity is a   widely speculated new TV streaming service    . Cook recently disclosed they have been hiring TV   executives for a project many believe is in preparation to launch   its own original content next year.It's been estimated that Apple's TV service could be worth $37   billion over several years. This would definitely keep the   narrative going about Apple's transformation into a service   company, which is the company's fastest-growing sales category   currently making up nearly 20% of its total revenue.While Apple continues to churn out the same products every   year, it's clear management is working on some big projects that   many investors aren't aware of yet. This giant company is worth a   look.  10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

  Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) has helped   Fitbit    (NYSE: FIT) sell a ton of its wearable gadgetry over the years,   but the online retailer's next act may be that of a competitor   more than that of an ally. Amazon keeps taking baby steps into   health-monitoring gadgetry, and this week, Arcadia Group, a   health brand consultancy, announced that it's teaming up with   Amazon to offer a new line of products available exclusively   through Amazon's digital storefront.We're only talking about glucose monitors for diabetics and   blood pressure cuffs as the initial products coming out of the   new Choice brand. These products will hug your upper arm and   prick your finger, but Fitbit is still the only one of the three   that will take you by the wrist. Choice also won't be an Amazon   private label. Arcadia is developing and will own the brand. It's   simply striking a deal to make the brand exclusively available   via the e-tailer.Fitbit investors don't need to break a sweat about this right   now, but is anyone truly safe when it comes to Amazon and its   disruptive nature? If Amazon decides that fitness tracking is a   niche worth exploring with its growing line of hardware, it's not   going to make Fitbit's already difficult life any easier.  Image source: Fitbit.Fitbit is in a pickle. It was the undisputed champ in the   fitness bracelet market when the category was all the rage, but   as   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL)  and Android smartphones get better about   tracking daily activity levels, it's become less necessary to don   a dedicated fitness tracker. Apple has also been a thorn in   Fitbit's side through Apple Watch, and this summer, it   beat Fitbit to the punch    when its Apple Watch Series 4 line became the first smartwatch to   include heart rate sensors that offer FDA-cleared   electrocardiogram readings.The pressure points are undeniable. Fitbit has posted   declining revenue for seven straight quarters, including a 15%   year-over-year decline   last time out    . Fitbit reports its third-quarter results next week, shortly   after Wednesday's market close. Analysts are bracing for another   slight dip on the top line.The silver lining in duking it out with the class act of   Cupertino is that Apple's hardware doesn't come cheap. Fitbit's   taking Apple head-on with its own smartwatches at lower price   points than Apple's latest gadgets and offering even cheaper   stand-alone fitness trackers has a definite audience.   Unfortunately for Fitbit, that window of opportunity could close   if not shatter completely if Amazon jumps into the fray. Amazon   competes on price, and it's willing to sell hardware at or in   some cases below cost just to establish itself in a category.Amazon doesn't always win when it comes to hardware.   Fire Phone    anyone? It's also important to remember that Amazon has not   indicated that it will roll out its own health-monitoring   gadgetry, much less the fitness trackers or even smartwatches   that Fitbit cranks out.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has made repeated headlines about its impending expansion into the healthcare. From teaming up with JPMorgan  (NYSE: JPM ) and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A , NYSE: BRK.B ) to form a still-vague healthcare alliance , to buying Pill Pack , Wall Street is ready for the e-commerce giant to "disrupt" the healthcare sector next. But the truth of the matter is, Amazon is not alone. Many of the biggest tech stocks have been quietly exploring the healthcare sector.So why are giant tech companies pivoting toward healthcare?There are a few reasons. One, of course, is the baby boomers. As the once-largest generation in U.S. history ( millennials have surpassed them ) ages, healthcare costs are exploding. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimates that healthcare spending will increase an average of 5.5% over the next ten years and represent 19.7% of the economy - or about $5.7 trillion . Is it any surprise that a sector that prides itself on disrupting others would want a piece of that pie?The second reason stems from the first. Many investors are aware that we're in a technological renaissance right now. New technologies are being invented at a staggering rate and our abilities with existing ones are improving just as quickly. But did you know the rate of scientific discovery has kept pace as well? New companies are popping up all the time, and they need funding, partners and even acquirers. These are two sectors where innovative, exciting and yes, profitable advancements are being made every day. Why wouldn't major tech stocks look for inroads here? After all, to disrupt a stagnant market, you have to push out old stalwarts; but jump into an expanding one, and you're along for the ride.The third reason for tech companies to enter the U.S. healthcare market is, well, that the U.S. healthcare market is broken. It's inefficient, not equal-access , overpriced and in a shocking recent discovery, complicated . Enter tech companies. Today's largest tech companies have the capital and the motivation (read: more capital) to find solutions to some of the nations' biggest healthcare problems, and a number are doing just that.Last week, CNBC pointed out that many of the largest tech companies have hired cardiologists recently . Not just Amazon, but Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOOG ) Verily have expanded into just this specific area of healthcare. CNBC pointed out that this is likely because the wealth of research into heart disease and what prevents it gives these companies an easy path to profit. There's already evidence that consumer products can help .But what about the tech companies that are innovating in healthcare? There are plenty of those as well. Here are eight tech stocks, besides Amazon, that are pivoting to healthcare.Unlike Amazon and Google, which started as niche companies and have expanded into one industry after the other, Apple has built the largest publically traded company in the world through one key thing: intuitive, consumer-friendly devices integrated into the Apple ecosystem. When it comes to healthcare, Apple is sticking to its strength.If you've heard of Apple in healthcare, you've likely heard about it in the context of the Apple Watch. The company's most recent release - the Apple Watch Series 4 - brings an improved heart rate monitor and fall detection, but Apple is also partnering with other companies to make its smartwatch even smarter.For example, Dexcom (NASDAQ: DXCM ) now works with Apple to bring continuous glucose monitoring to the Apple watch. This allows diabetes patients to always be aware of their glucose levels so they can react to any fluctuations before they become dangerous. The information can also be viewed on an iPhone - or a loved one's iPhone , which is useful for caretakers. Apple Watches can also be paired with the FDA-cleared KardiaBand for a clinical-grade EKG for heart patients .But if this was all Apple was doing to get into healthcare, this spot on the list could be occupied by Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ). Instead, Apple is doing something worthy of its size and resources: slowly invading hospitals and making its integrated product ecosystem indispensable to them. With Apple's healthcare products and platform , doctors, nurses and patients can use Apple products to store medical records (that are shared instantly with healthcare and support teams), explain conditions, view imaging, monitor patients at home and even prescribe medication. A growing list of hospitals already use this system.Apple is even getting into medical research, but it's doing it in true Apple fashion - by providing the easy-to-use platform. With ResearchKit , Apple helps streamline the process of clinical trials and allows researchers to build apps for their specific needs. This allows clinical trials to be open to more people, streamlining the research itself and making the data obtained more useful. Apps built using ResearchKit have been used to study Parkinson's disease and diagnose autism in young children.Meanwhile, CareKit, a complementary platform lets healthcare providers develop apps to help patients manage their medical conditions. Fellow mega-cap tech stock Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is taking a similar approach to Apple when it comes to healthcare. It's adapting existing technologies like Office 365, Windows and Azure to provide healthcare solutions. Microsoft's tech - which is shifting toward subscription revenue - is being used to coordinate healthcare across vast networks, improving patient experiences and outcomes. It can also securely store patient data and ensure compliance with different standards, such as HIPAA.How useful is this? The U.K.'s NHS entered into a deal with Microsoft earlier this year to protect its data and is using Office 365 to improve its information exchange and collaboration capabilities across the country-wide network. Having an entire country's healthcare network as a customer is not something to ignore.Unlike Apple, however, Microsoft is not stopping with existing technologies. It has launched an entire healthcare division to explore the uses of artificial intelligence in healthcare . Between 2013 and 2017 Microsoft filed 73 healthcare patents . Healthcare NExT aims to accelerate healthcare innovation by harnessing MSFT's AI and cloud computing abilities.Microsoft Healthcare is also partnering with biotech companies in everything from mixed-reality three-dimensional imaging and surgery assistance to using AI and machine learning to map the human immune system and develop a universal bloodtest for the early detection of almost any disease.Formerly known as Google Life Sciences, Alphabet's Verily Life Sciences "lives at the intersection of technology, data science and healthcare." Basically, Alphabet is taking what it already excels at - data collection, organization and analysis and cutting-edge technology - and aiming it at healthcare.Verily develops tools to collect and organize health data. Released earlier this year, the new Cloud Healthcare Application Programming Interface (API) simplifies medical data for healthcare providers. It allows different healthcare data types and programs to be used together and uploaded to the cloud. This makes it easy to access and transfer a patient's medical history.But the technology doesn't stop there. Once a patient's data in the cloud, it can be used for analytics and research. And as machine learning capabilities increase, all of this data can be used to see trends across many patients and improve treatments and diagnosis capabilities.Verily's deep learning capabilities have already been shown to predict inpatient mortality, unexpected re-admissions and a length of stay better than traditional models . Keep in mind that was just one study, but the study used massive amounts of data.Although important, all of that isn't particularly flashy or interesting. But don't worry, Alphabet is not falling behind in the cool new tech area when it comes to healthcare either. Verily has a range of ambitious technologies and projects in different stages of development .For example, Verily has teamed up with Novartis (NYSE: NVS ) subsidiary and eye-care giant Alcon to develop smart contact lenses. These lenses contain integrated circuits, sensors and wireless communication capabilities. Right now, the still-in-development lenses are glucose sensors that provide vision correction, but there are many more applications if Verily can pull this off this extremely complex technology.Verily has also developed Liftware , utensils with stabilizing technology that help people with hand tremors and other arm and hand mobility issues feed themselves and be independent.And then there's Galvani Bioelectronics, a joint partnership between Verily and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK ). This venture is focused on the development of bioelectronic medicines - medicines consisting of miniaturized, implantable devices. The company was formed in 2016 , and developing a new field of medicine isn't fast, so there's not much news yet, but it's definitely something to keep an eye on.Moving a bit lower on the market-cap scale (and I mean a bit), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) is another tech stock making inroads into healthcare.  Predictive clinical analytics combine data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence to identify at-risk patients and populations and improve the allocation of our health resources. For an individual patient, this might mean having a rapid response team ready for someone with specialized needs. On a population level, this would mean improving practices for certain groups of people at risk for specific health complications.Intel has also figured out how to bring machine learning into medical diagnoses. By inputting vast amounts of patient data into Saffron's Natural Intelligence Platform, data scientists and leading cardiologists were able to distinguish between two previously difficult to separate diagnoses -  cardiomyopathy and constrictive pericarditis .This is huge. If constrictive pericarditis is misdiagnosed and treated like cardiomyopathy, it can be fatal. Today's machine learning is capable of analyzing up to 10,000 different attributes per each beat of a patient's heart and comparing it to the attributes of patients with either cardiomyopathy or constrictive pericarditis.Intel chips and processors themselves could also play a huge role in healthcare advancement. Intel has teamed up with Surgical Theater to power their Precision VR , a medical visualization platform that can combine existing imaging technology to build 3D models of a patients' brain. Not only does this help educate patients about their specific conditions before brain surgery, it can also help neurosurgeons make patient-specific plans for brain surgery to perform the safest procedure possible.Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) has been hit lately over the concern that the chip market has entered bear market territory . But Nvidia's healthcare forays underline the growth narrative for the tech stock. The chip market isn't oversaturated because its customer base growing at a faster rate than ever before.One area that now needs the GPU chips that Nvidia produces is healthcare. As other tech stocks like GOOGL, AAPL and AMZN develop these amazing new technologies that require computing power never seen before, someone has to provide the computing power. Nvidia is one of these companies. Their GPU-accelerated applications and systems are allowing healthcare providers and researchers to analyze huge amounts of data, to do things like genetic analysis and improving diagnoses.One area where Nvidia surpasses other chipmakers is in graphics, and that leads to Nvidia Clara , a medical imaging platform that brings AI to next-generation medical imaging. This improves diagnosis, detection, and treatment of almost all diseases and ailments.Just this week, Nvidia announced a partnership with Scripps Research Translational Institute to develop AI and deep learning applications for genomic and digital health sensor data ."AI in medicine has tremendous promise," said Eric Topol, Scripps Research Translational Intitute's founder and director. "Eventually, it will markedly improve accuracy, efficiency, and workflow in medical practice with the potential to lower cost. But so much of this depends on validating AI algorithms and proving clinical efficacy. The data inputs from sensors and sequencing, in particular, will play an important role."You've likely heard of the Internet of Things (IoT), the new interconnectedness of every device from your smart speaker to your refrigerator to your doorbell. But what about the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)? Wouldn't it make sense for medical devices to be connected to each other to enhance patient care? Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) agrees, and that's why it's  leading the way - connecting everyone who wants to accompany it.Qualcomm believes that along with the technological advancements that will come with the IoMT, will come new technical challenges. As such, QCOM has developed the 2net Platform , "a scalable, secure, cloud-based infrastructure enabling end-to-end connectivity."The 2net Platform creates a network with what QCOM calls "medical-grade connectivity." This includes healthcare devices within a hospital or healthcare setting and even the patients' homes themselves. Wearables, medical devices, and sensors can transmit information back to a physician through QCOM's secure ecosystem.Qualcomm designs the products that create this network itself, but also offers design kits to those looking to make products that connect to the IoMT.To be clear, the two ride-sharing apps did not go private while you weren't looking. Although it looks like Lyft may beat Uber there . But Uber and Lyft are both expanding into healthcare. At the end of 2017, areas with Lyft and Uber had seen a decrease of 7% in ambulance usage . Patients who need to go to the hospital, but know they aren't in a life-threatening condition are opting to use Lyft and Uber, thus freeing up ambulances to get to emergencies faster. And when people need ambulances, a few minutes can be the difference between life and death.But those are just the side effects of Lyft and Uber's existence. What are the companies actually doing to enter the healthcare space? Basically, they're expanding access to healthcare. Almost 3.6 million people miss doctors' appointments due to lack of transportation each year, and this is a much bigger problem in areas with low access to public transportation and low car ownership.Uber Health allows healthcare professionals or their offices to book a ride to a patient's appointment up to 30 days ahead of time. The patient receives texts to confirm the trip details, but no other action is needed on their part. The patients don't need to be Uber users or even have a phone - opening up the service to more elderly patients.In 2017, Lyft partnered with Blue Cross Blue Shield to get patients to appointments. They then expanded the service to get patients in transportation deserts to the nearest CVS  (NYSE: CVS ) and Walgreens (NASDAQ: WBA ) pharmacies to pick up medication. But this isn't just for people with private health insurance: Lyft has teamed up with a number of organizations to expand access to their service to those with Medicaid and Medicare .Also, in usual Lyft fashion, they more quietly offer a similar service to Uber where individual healthcare providers can sign up to schedule patient rides .As of this writing, Regina Borsellino held no positions in the aforementioned securities.The post 8 Tech Stocks to Buy for the Future of Healthcare - Besides Amazon appeared first on InvestorPlace .
How Many iPhones Will Apple (AAPL) Sell in Q4?
 Apple AAPL  became the first publicly listed U.S. company to reach $1 trillion in market value on the back of the iPhone. Now, with its fiscal fourth quarter financial results due out Thursday, November 1, let's look at how many flagship smartphones Apple is projected to sell and how much revenue the iPhone will generate. iPhone Apple introduced its new iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max in mid-September at its now customary launch event. Apple's CEO Tim Cook and other executives showed off the tech giant's latest offerings, which also featured the next generation Apple Watch, in order to hype sales before the key holiday shopping period.Last year's high-priced 10 th  anniversary iPhones, which these new models build upon, helped lift iPhone revenues despite slower unit growth. The iPhone XS Max is set to start at $1,099 and could cost up to $1,449. Therefore, the new phones should theoretically help boost Apple's top line once again.But Apple's fiscal fourth quarter won't include many new iPhone sales since it will feature the quarterly results for the period that ended on September 30. With that said, let's see how many iPhones Apple is expected to sell and how much revenue the company is expected to make from them since the smartphone is still its most important business unit.    To prepare for this, we can turn to our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file. The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non-financial metrics reported by companies. The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts.Apple's total iPhone unit sales are projected to reach 46.954 million, based on our latest NFM estimates. This would mark less than a 1% jump from the year-ago quarter's 46.677 million.Luckily, the higher prices look as though they will once again boost iPhone revenues in a big way.The tech giant's total iPhone revenues are expected to surge roughly 23.5% from $28.846 billion in Q4 of 2017 to hit $35.651 billion this year. Apple saw its iPhone revenues pop 20% in Q3 to hit $29.906 billion. Meanwhile, third-quarter iPhone unit sales rose marginally from 41.026 million to 41.300 million. Q4 Overall, Apple's Q4 revenues are projected to climb by 17.1% to hit $61.55 billion, based our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. Therefore, based on our projections, iPhone revenues are expected to account for approximately 58% of Apple's total Q4 revenues. Meanwhile, Apple is projected to see its adjusted quarterly earnings soar by 34.3% to reach $2.78 per share.Apple has also earned a ton of positive earnings estimate revisions over the last 60 days. This positive earnings revision movement helps Apple earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Investors should also remember that Apple's other business units, including services and "other products," continue to shine.Plus, Apple is ready to enter the streaming TV market to take on Netflix NFLX  , Amazon AMZN  , Hulu, and soon enough Disney DIS  .

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ), the parent company of Google, beat on earnings estimates but missed on revenue. GOOG stock fell in morning trading to the lows not seen since April.Separate from the disappointing revenue numbers, a series of setbacks has weighed on the stock recently. Meanwhile, the company continued to increase its cash position. Given these facts, I believe if GOOG begins to use some of its cash to pay dividends , it would stem the decline of Alphabet stock.GOOG blew away earnings estimates, reporting $13.06 in third-quarter income. Analysts had expected only $10.40 per share in earnings. This also far exceeds last year's Q3 earnings of $9.57 per share.However, revenues fell short of Wall Street expectations. The company reported that they brought in $33.7 billion in the previous quarter. Consensus revenue estimates were $34.05 billion. GOOGL brought in $27.77 billion in the same quarter last year. Alphabet blamed the strong U.S. dollar for the slightly lower revenue numbers. Despite the 21.3% year-over-year increase in revenue, investors sent Alphabet stock down in morning trading.Like in prior quarters, Google's ad business accounted for the vast majority of revenues - $28.95 billion to be exact. This came in about 20% higher than last year's number. While the market has adjusted to Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) in this business, investors increasingly worry about competition from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) as well. However, with 20% revenue growth, any concerns have yet to appear in the numbers.Also, those wanting to see GOOG stock depend less on ads will like what came out of this report. What Alphabet describes as "other revenue" came in at $4.64 billion, a 29% increase from last year's number. This category includes cloud-related sales and hardware devices such as Google Home.Although I see nothing in this report that detracts from the company's long-term trajectory, investors have soured on GOOG stock in many respects. The decline began when European regulators slapped Alphabet with a €4.34 billion ($4.92 billion) fine for using Android bundles to block rival apps. As a result, it stopped bundling Google apps to Android in Europe.Other negative news weighed on the stock during the quarter. GOOG faced criticism for introducing a censored search app for the Chinese market. Additionally, allegations that the company protected executives from sexual misconduct allegation has further hurt the reputation of the company.Despite the lowered stock price, GOOGL stock still trades at a P/E ratio of almost 47. That exceeds the P/E of fellow tech giant  Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and is only slightly higher than  Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). However, AAPL and MSFT stock also stand out in one key area - they pay a dividend.As I mentioned before , the fact that Alphabet pays no dividend has begun to appear unseemly. As of the latest report, Alphabet now holds $106.42 billion in cash on its balance sheet. Only Apple and Microsoft hold more cash. Still, both of those companies also share their cash reserves with stockholders.Moreover, GOOG has seen its stock flirt with bear market territory just three months after hitting its all-time high. As things stand now, I think further declines for the stock will occur in the near term. However, if the company introduces a dividend, I would probably have to rethink that view.Given the revenue miss and its setbacks related to business in Europe and China, I believe a dividend offers the quickest path for a rebound in GOOG stock. Alphabet blew away expectations on earnings but missed on revenue. Wall Street punished the stock for the revenue number as GOOG fell in morning trading.This continues a decline that began in late July when European regulators ruled against Alphabet over bundles related to Android. Negative news in other areas has also weighed on the stock in recent months.However, the company still managed to increase its cash position. As a result, it now holds over $106 billion. Given these vast reserves, the company could join other tech giants such like Apple and Microsoft in paying a dividend. I believe this would stem the decline in GOOG stock and place the company on par with other mega-cap stocks in the tech industry. In its 20-year history, an immense level of success has blessed Alphabet. Giving some of that back in the form of dividends can only expand that blessing.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDespite the recent volatility, stocks are still mostly up for the year. When the stock market marches higher, it pushes the prices of many companies higher along with it.

Fortunately, Simply Safe Dividends identified the 10 best dividend growth stocks that investors can rely on for secure, fast-growing income.These companies all have very healthy  Dividend Safety Scores , which measure a firm's most important financial metrics to gauge how likely it is to cut its dividend in the future.Let's take a look at 10 of the safest dividend stocks in the market. These dividend-paying companies generate excellent free cash flow, maintain safe payout ratios, are committed to rewarding shareholders with healthy dividend increases and have bright long-term outlooks.[ Editor's note: This story was originally published on December 2017. All dividend yields have been updated. ]Dividend Yield:  2%5-Year Annual Dividend Growth Rate: 21.5%Year-to-Date Gain:  6.9%With 2,370 store locations, Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE: LOW ) is the world's second-largest home improvement retailer and it serves more than 17 million customers a week in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.With more than 65 years of existence, this dividend stock has gained recognition as one of the trusted national brands. Over the years, Lowe's has developed an extensive line of thousands of products for maintenance, repair, remodeling and decorating across lumber and building materials, tools and hardware, lawn and garden, paint, kitchens, outdoor power equipment and home fashion categories.The company serves a wide spectrum of "do-it-yourself" and "do-it-for-me" customers, including homeowners, renters and professional contractors from different construction trades.A large footprint of conveniently located stores across the U.S., an extensive range of products, a well-known brand and a diversified customer base are Lowe's key competitive advantages .The home improvement industry is also poised to grow as consumer confidence remains high, employment continues rising and home prices climb higher. This should lead to better growth prospects for the company and its dividend.Lowe's has an impeccable record of not only paying but also increasing its dividend since 1961, growing it by over 20% annually in the last five years. It last raised its dividend payout by an impressive 17%.Lowe's targets a dividend payout ratio of 35% in the future, which should provide plenty of room to continue growing dividends at a double-digit pace going forward. Lowe's forward price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16.4 is below the market's and seems reasonable for a company of this quality.Dividend Yield:  2.2%5-Year Annual Dividend Growth Rate: 12.7%YTD Gain: -3%Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE: HON ) is a diversified global technology and manufacturing company supplying industrial products, software and services to a diversified set of customers.Honeywell operates through four segments: aerospace (36% of 2016 sales); home and building technologies (28%); performance materials and technologies (22%) and safety and productivity solutions (14%). About 46% of Honeywell's sales are from the U.S., followed by 28% in EMEA, 17% in APAC and 9% from the rest of the world.The company serves customers through a wide variety of products and services in aerospace, control, sensing and security. It also sells specialty chemicals and advanced materials as well as energy efficiency products.Simply put, Honeywell has invented key technologies that address some of the world's most critical challenges around energy, safety, security, productivity and urbanization. With a broad portfolio of physical products and software, the company has uniquely positioned itself to sell comprehensive solutions for homes and businesses across many industries.A broad portfolio of technology, extensive products and services, a global distribution network, and a presence in growing areas like the Internet of Things and energy efficiency are Honeywell's key strengths.A track record of strong financial performance and a healthy 40% payout ratio have enabled the company to grow its dividend by 12.3% per year over the last five years. Honeywell last raised its payout by 12% in 2017 and it has paid uninterrupted dividends for more than two decades. It is also a dividend achiever since it has increased its dividend for more than 10 consecutive years.The company has guided for double-digit earnings growth as a part of its five-year plan ending in 2018. It should, therefore, continue its impressive dividend growth streak with high-single to low-double-digit annual payout growth in the future as well.Dividend Yield: 1.3%3-Year Annual Dividend Growth Rate:  33.8%YTD Gain: 27%Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is the world's most valuable company and one of the largest positions in Warren Buffett's dividend stock portfolio .Apple is the world's second-largest smartphone company, accounting for more than 11% of the global market share, according to Gadgets Now. The iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV are Apple's key products, with the iPhone representing over 60% of 2017 sales. These products are globally recognized for their high quality, premium brand and ease-of-use, allowing Apple to enjoy substantial pricing power.In addition, the company also owns a portfolio of consumer and professional software such as iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS operating systems that act as key differentiators. Apple's products and solutions are known for their innovative design, user-friendly experience and seamless integration. All these innovative products have established Apple's supremacy in the mobile space, and the company invests around 5% of its revenues on R&D activities to stay ahead of competitors.Moreover, only Apple devices run iOS, which means that if customers want to remain within the Apple ecosystem, they must continue buying iOS devices. This results in sticky customer relationships. Its sales of games, music and other digital content through the iTunes store is another high-margin cash flow stream that keeps growing every year.A leading brand name, global geographical presence, impressive product portfolio and super-sticky customer relationships have helped form a huge moat around Apple's business.Apple started paying dividends again in 2012 and it has seen its payout grow by approximately 10% annually over the last three years. It last raised its payout by 11% and maintains a low payout ratio below 30%.Given Apple's leading market share, loyal customers, innovative products and hoard of cash on the balance sheet, the company should continue raising its dividend at a strong pace in the future as well.Dividend Yield: 2.2%5-Year Annual Dividend Growth Rate: 13.3%YTD Gain:  11.6%Medtronic plc. Ordinary Shares  (NYSE: MDT ) is a leading medical technology, services and solutions company serving hospitals, physicians, clinicians and patients worldwide.

Medtronic has compounded its dividend by 16.4% annually over the last two decades, too.Given the company's technology leadership and unmatched breadth and scale, Medtronic should be able to continue its dividend growth streak at a high-single-digit rate going forward. Investors can learn more about Medtronic's competitive advantages and business profile here .Dividend Yield:  3.4%3-Year Annual Dividend Growth Rate:  19.6%YTD Gain:  -13%Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ: TXN ) is one of the largest designers and sellers of semiconductors globally. It develops analog integrated circuits and embedded processors that are subsequently sold to electronics manufacturers. The company's product portfolio consists of tens of thousands of products that are used to accomplish many different things, such as converting and amplifying signals, interfacing with other devices and managing and distributing power.Texas Instruments' focus on these segments provides a combination of stability and strong cash generation, owing to the products' long product life cycles and low capital-intensive manufacturing.The company currently commands an 18% and 17% share of the analog and embedded processing markets, respectively, and it appears well-positioned to increase its dominance over time.In terms of end markets, "Industrial" is Texas Instruments' largest market, accounting for 33% of total revenues, followed by Personal Electronics (26%), Automotive (18%), Communications Equipment (13%), Enterprise Systems (6%) and Others (4%).

Costco's membership base is growing with a renewal rate of 90% in the U.S. and Canada, and 87% on a worldwide basis in 2017.Over its 35 years of existence, Costco has succeeded in providing a great customer experience by blending together the convenience of specialty departments and a selection of wide merchandise at affordable prices. It has become a trusted name owing to its low cost and quality merchandise.The company buys directly from many producers of national brand-name merchandise and sends products directly to its warehouses, eliminating multi-step distribution costs. High sales volumes, rapid inventory turnover, efficient distribution and self-service warehouse facilities also ensure high operational efficiency.A large and loyal customer base, economies of scale, a diverse mix of merchandise, and strategically-located warehouses are Costco's major competitive advantages .Costco has increased its dividend at 13% per-year over the last decade and last raised its payout by 11%. It also paid a special dividend of $7-per-share this year.Analysts expect Costco's sales growth to sit in the mid-single-digits range over the long-term, which could result in 8%-9% annual earnings growth in the coming years. Costco could, therefore, continue its solid pace of dividend growth.Dividend Yield:  2.1%3-Year Annual Dividend Growth Rate: 23.2%YTD Gain:  8.7%American Tower Corp  (NYSE: AMT ) is a leading owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. The company was formed in 1995 as a unit of American Radio Systems and it was spun off in 1998 when that company merged with CBS Corporation.American Tower reports its results in five segments U.S. (59% of 2016 sales), Asia (14%), EMEA (9%) and Latin America (17%) property, and services (1%). It owns a portfolio of approximately 149,000 communications sites, including 40,000 towers in the U.S. and over 108,000 towers internationally.American Tower leases space on its communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, government agencies and tenants in a number of industries. Its top tenants include well-known names like AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T ), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ ), T-Mobile Us Inc (NASDAQ: TMUS ) and Sprint Corp (NYSE: S ).The real estate investment trust derives most of its revenue from tenant leases, which typically have an initial non-cancellable term of ten years with multiple renewal terms, as well as provisions for annual price increases. It is difficult for tenants to find suitable alternative sites and as such the lease renewal rates are generally high.Moreover, the incremental operating costs associated with adding new tenants to an existing communications site are relatively low and annual capital expenditures to maintain communications sites are also not high. All these factors provide high cash flow visibility and excellent profitability for American Tower.American Tower should keep growing its earnings as demand for wireless services and data grows in the coming years. A global asset base, recession-proof demand for its sites, long-standing relationships with customers and low cash flow volatility provide a moat around American Tower's business.Simply put, wireless tower companies possess many attractive qualities. That's probably why Crown Castle International (CCI), one of American Tower's peers, is a position in Bill Gates' dividend stock portfolio .American Tower's dividend has grown at a very impressive 25% compound annual growth rate over the last three years, and its adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) payout ratio sits below 40%.Given American Tower's history of double-digit growth in property revenue for the last seven years and its doubling of dividends in just the past five years, shareholders can likely expect close to 20% annual dividend growth in the years ahead.Dividend Yield: 1.3%3-Year Annual Dividend Growth Rate: 10.2%YTD Gain:  6.3%Becton, Dickinson andCo (NYSE: BDX )  is a global medical technology company engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment and diagnostic products.

Becton Dickinson is also growing its presence in emerging markets.The company spent over 6% of its revenue on R&D activities in FY17 and has major R&D facilities located in North America, China, France, India, Ireland and Singapore. BDX's customer base is also quite diverse, ranging from healthcare institutions, life science researchers and the pharmaceutical industry to clinical laboratories and the general public.Diversification across geographies, customers and products, strong R&D capabilities and a portfolio of successful brands are Becton Dickinson's key competitive advantages. With more than a century's worth of operating experience, the company is known for providing integrated products and services that seamlessly support healthcare providers across care areas. Its acquisition of C.R. Bard is also expected to create a stronger company in the future.Becton Dickinson is a dividend aristocrat with 46 years of consecutive dividend growth. It has grown its dividend at an impressive 10% compound annual growth rate over the last five years.With a payout ratio just over 60% and a need to restore its balance sheet after acquiring C.R. Bard, dividend growth over the near-term will likely remain below the company's historical double-digit pace. However, with earnings expected to grow by 10% over the next two years, it won't be long before investors are once again rewarded with strong payout growth.Dividend Yield:  2%5-Year Annual Dividend Growth Rate:  7.4%YTD Gain:  21.1%Automatic Data Processing  (NASDAQ: ADP ) is a top global provider of cloud-based Human Capital Management (HCM) solutions, and a leader in business outsourcing services, analytics and compliance expertise.Automatic Data Processing's business can be categorized into two reportable segments - Employer Services (73% of 2017 revenue) and Professional Employer Organization Services (27%).

Intel's Modem Business Just Got a 131% Boost Thanks to Apple
 Several months ago,   Qualcomm    (NASDAQ: QCOM) , a longtime supplier of cellular modem chips for   Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone product line,   admitted to investors that Apple wouldn't be   using its modems in its new iPhones    and would instead purchase modems from a competitor. That   competitor was widely understood to be chip giant   Intel    (NASDAQ: INTC) .Apple had already used Intel modems for some of its iPhone   7-series, 8-series, and X devices, but it formerly sourced modems   from both Qualcomm and Intel. By clinching the entirety of the   modem orders in this year's iPhones, Intel's modem business stood   to win big. And, as we saw in Intel's third-quarter earnings   release, win big it did.  Image source: Intel.In its third-quarter earnings presentation, Intel observed   that its cellular modem sales grew by 131% year over year.The company doesn't explicitly break out its cellular modem   revenue, but it's important to know that cellular modem revenue   is included in the "adjacency" portion of the company's client   computing group (CCG) results. That revenue was up 66.3% year   over year, hitting $1.21 billion in the quarter. In its 10-Q   filing, the company said the year-over-year growth in CCG   adjacency revenue in the third quarter came "primarily from modem   products."If we suppose, then, that the entirety of the year-over-year   adjacency growth derived from modems (this is probably an   aggressive assumption, though, as the company appears to be   gaining share in the market for   PC Wi-Fi chips    ), then Intel's total quarterly cellular modem revenue looks like   it was in the ballpark of $852 million.Investors should keep in mind that Apple iPhone shipments tend   to peak during its first fiscal quarter (specifically, in   December) and fall off in subsequent quarters before demand   surges again when new iPhone models are launched. In light of   this, don't expect Intel's modem revenue to stay this high over   the next several quarters. However, it's a good bet that the   company's modem shipments will continue to exhibit strong   year-over-year growth over the course of the current iPhone   product cycle.Indeed, during Intel's third-quarter earnings call, interim   CEO and CFO Bob Swan said that in 2019, the company expects to   "continue to grow memory and modem," and that those segments will   be "accretive to earnings but a little dilutive to gross margin."   Intel's gross margin on cellular modems is lower than the margins   it generates from its PC and data-center processors.Intel is clearly benefiting from the significant increase in   modem share in this year's iPhones. There's still room for the   company to pick up some additional iPhone share over time as   Apple discontinues older models like the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8   product families and replaces them with products powered solely   by Intel processors. But the large step-function increase in   Intel's iPhone modem share will happen over the course of this   iPhone product cycle.The company also seems to be looking to boost profitability of   its modem revenue over time. If we rewind back to the company's   second-quarter earnings call, Swan said the following in response   to an analyst's question:... [We expect] to improve gross margins for our modem     business, both with our 7560 product [author's note: this is     the product that powers Apple's latest iPhones] that will begin     to ship in the second half, but also, as we migrate to a     5G      world, we expect margins in the modem business to continue to     improve.After all these years, Intel has finally found real financial   success in the smartphone chip business.  10 stocks we like better than Intel       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

  (RTTNews.com) - Following the substantial rebound seen in the previous session, stocks extended their recent see-saw performance with a sharp pullback during trading on Friday. The major averages regained some ground after an early sell-off but still ended the day significantly lower. The Dow slumped 296.24 points or 1.2 percent to 24,688.31, the Nasdaq plummeted 151.12 points or 2.1 percent to 7,167.21 and the S&P 500 tumbled 46.88 points or 1.7 percent to 2,658.69. The major averages also mover sharply lower for the week. The Dow plunged by 3 percent, while the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 nosedived by 3.8 percent and 3.9 percent, respectively. The pullback on Wall Street came amid a negative reaction to corporate results from some big-name companies after upbeat results from companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Twitter (TWTR) contributed to the jump on Thursday. Shares of Amazon (AMZN) fell sharply after the online retail giant reported third quarter earnings that beat estimates but weaker than expected revenues and provided disappointing fourth quarter guidance. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) also closed notably lower after also reporting better than expected third earnings but revenues that came in below expectations. Meanwhile, shares of Intel (INTC) showed a strong move to the upside after the semiconductor giant reported third quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates and raised its full-year guidance. Traders largely shrugged off a report from the Commerce Department showing stronger than expected U.S. economic growth in the third quarter. The Commerce Department said real gross domestic product advanced by 3.5 percent in the third quarter after surging up by 4.2 percent in the second quarter. Economists had expected GDP growth to slow to 3.3 percent. The slowdown in the pace of growth in the third quarter came after the jump in the second quarter represented the fastest growth since a 4.9 percent spike in the third quarter of 2014. On the inflation front, the Commerce Department said its reading on core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy prices, showed price growth slowed to 1.6 percent in the third quarter from 2.1 percent in the second quarter. "Another decent growth number will be welcome news for President Trump, but for markets, the bigger question is where the economy goes next," said ING economists James Smith and Jonas Goltermann. Smith and Goltermann added, "We see no reason to expect an imminent correction, although growth may begin to ease in 2019 as higher rates bite and fiscal tailwinds fade." A separate report from the University of Michigan showed consumer sentiment deteriorated by slightly more than initially estimated in the month of October. The report said the consumer sentiment index for October was downwardly revised to 98.6 from the preliminary reading of 99.0. Economists had expected the consumer sentiment index to be unrevised at 99.0, which was still down from 100.1 in September. Sector News Most of the major sectors climbed off their worst levels of the day, although substantial weakness remained visible among computer hardware stocks. The NYSE Arca Computer Hardware Index plunged by 5.4 percent to its lowest closing level in well over a year. Hard drive maker Western Digital (WDC) led the hardware sector lower after reporting weaker than expected fiscal first quarter results. Retail stocks also ended the day sharply lower on the heels of Amazon's disappointing results, with the Dow Jones Retail Index plummeting by 4 percent. The index ended the session at a more than four-month closing low. Telecom, commercial real estate, software, and utilities stocks also saw considerable weakness, while gold stocks were among the few groups to buck the downtrend amid an increase by the price of the precious metal. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly lower during trading on Friday. Japan'sNikkei 225 Index fell by 0.4 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slumped by 1.1 percent. The major European markets also showed significant moves to the downside on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index tumbled by 1.3 percent, the U.K.'sFTSE 100 Index and the German DAX Index both dropped by 0.9 percent. In the bond market, treasuries moved notably higher following the modest pullback in the previous session. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, slid 5.9 basis points to 3.077 percent. Looking Ahead Economic data may attract attention next week, with the Labor Department scheduled to release its closely watched monthly jobs report next Friday. Traders are also likely to keep an eye on reports on personal income and spending, consumer confidence, labor productivity and costs, manufacturing activity, and international trade. On the earnings front, Coca-Cola (KO), General Electric (GE), Pfizer (PFE), Amgen Facebook (FB), General Motors (GM), DowDuPont (DWDP), Apple ( AAPL ), Starbucks (SBUX), and Exxon Mobil (XOM), are among a slew of companies due to report their quarterly results next week.

Additionally, improving China demand of smartphone units and seasonal ramps are anticipated to bolster Mobile Products ("MP") revenues.    Reportedly Apple AAPL  has selected Qorvo as the secondary supplier of low-band power amplifier/duplexer (PAD) filter for its iPhone XR over Broadcom AVGO  . Notably, Qorvo's another peer Skyworks' SWKS  power-amplifier chips enable iPhones to transmit data at elevated speeds.    Solid demand of Qorvo's performance-tier for RF Fusion based solutions, antenna tuning, discrete components and BAW-based multiplexers is expected to be a tailwind. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MP revenues is projected to be $635 million.    Qorvo's strength in enhanced 5G infrastructure solutions portfolio deserves a special mention. Accelerating timeline for 5G deployment is a positive.    However, the company anticipates operating expenses to increase in the second quarter to approximately $170 million on higher personnel costs, including increased design activity.

 By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were lower on Friday afternoon following a slew of high-profile earnings disappointments, but indexes were off the day's lows and the S&P 500 eased off correction levels. Data earlier in the day showed the U.S. economy continued to grow at a healthy pace, offering some support. While economic growth is healthy despite trade wars, the same cannot be said of U.S. corporate profit growth, with disappointing forecasts this earnings season showing how tariffs, rising wages and borrowing costs as well as jitters over geopolitical events are hurting companies. The latest came last night from Amazon.com Inc  and Alphabet Inc, two stocks that have helped power the equity markets decade-long bull run. Google-parent Alphabet's revenue missed estimates, fanning concerns that regulatory scrutiny and competition would throttle its scorching pace of growth. The stock recovered from an earlier drop of as much as 5.6 percent to trade down 3.2 percent. Amazon tumbled 8.2 percent after it missed quarterly sales estimates and gave a below par holiday-season sales forecast.  Some investors saw the selloff as a buying opportunity. "It's been a very controlled selloff," said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. While he expects further downside in the market, Paulsen said many investors are looking for chances to buy. "Most people I would argue are sitting around talking about where do we buy. They look at this still more as a buying opportunity than a risk." The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 333.12 points, or 1.33 percent, to 24,651.43, the S&P 500  lost 52.84 points, or 1.95 percent, to 2,652.73 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 168.79 points, or 2.31 percent, to 7,149.55. The S&P 500 was on course for its worst month in more than nine-and-a-half years and at the day's low was on pace to confirm it was in correction territory, a level when an index closes 10 percent or more below its all-time closing high. The Nasdaq confirmed a correction earlier this week. Facebook Inc, Apple Inc  and Netflix Inc, the other members of the so-called FAANG group, were also down. While indexes pared their gains, investors still worried about more near-term volatility, particularly ahead of the Nov. 6 U.S. midterm congressional elections.

 On Oct. 25, chip giant   Intel    (NASDAQ: INTC) reported its third-quarter financial results, and   there's really only one way to describe the company's performance   in the quarter as well as its outlook for the remainder of the   year: stunning.Without further ado, let's dive into what the chipmaker   delivered for its investors.  Image source: Intel.Intel reported sales of $19.2 billion in the third quarter, up   19% from the same period a year ago. That figure was well ahead   of the high-end of the revenue guidance of between $17.6 billion   and $18.6 billion the company gave last quarter. Earnings per   share (EPS) on a non-   GAAP    basis of $1.40 per share grew 39% year over year. Intel's   guidance had targeted $1.15 per share, give or take $0.05, so the   company crushed it on EPS, too.For the fourth quarter, Intel is anticipating revenue of $19   billion -- down a smidgen from the levels that it saw in the   third quarter -- with non-GAAP EPS set to come in at $1.22. These   figures are well ahead of analysts' consensus of $18.39 billion   and $1.08 billion, respectively. At the midpoints of Intel's   fourth-quarter guidance, the company is set to enjoy about 11.4%   revenue growth and roughly 13% non-GAAP EPS growth during this   period.Naturally, the company -- for the third time in a row --   increased the midpoints of its non-GAAP full-year revenue and EPS   guidance to $71.2 billion and $4.53, respectively, well-outpacing   analyst expectations of $69.54 billion and $4.16, respectively.   If Intel achieves those figures, then it will deliver 13.4%   revenue and almost 31% EPS growth in 2018.In its earnings press release, the company said that these   results were "driven by broad business strength and customer   preference for performance-leading products." If you look at the   numbers that Intel provided, this statement is spot-on.Intel's biggest business -- its   client computing group (CCG)    -- delivered revenue growth of 16% to $10.23 billion. Sales of   the company's notebook platforms were up 8% year over year and   average selling prices grew 4%. Intel's desktop platform   shipments grew by 1% and average selling prices surged 10%. Total   CCG platform revenue hit $9.02 billion in the third quarter, up   about 11% year over year.Intel's CCG adjacency revenue -- that's auxiliary components   like Wi-Fi/Bluetooth combination chips and cellular modems -- was   up 66.3% year over year to $1.21 billion, undoubtedly helped by   the fact that the company   won the entirety    of   Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone modem orders for the current iPhone   product cycle. Intel said in its earnings presentation that its   cellular modem sales popped 131% year over year during the   quarter.CCG operating income rose almost 25.9%, outpacing revenue.The story was similar over in the company's data center group   (DCG), too, which saw sales rise an eye-popping 26% year over   year to $6.14 billion. DCG platform unit volumes expanded 15% and   average selling prices rose 10%, yielding a more than 26%   increase in platform revenue. DCG adjacency revenue was up only   14.4%, but it's a small enough part of the total -- just under   8.2% of total DCG sales in the quarter -- that it didn't really   detract from the great growth in the company's DCG platform   sales.DCG also turned in operating income of $3.08 billion for the   quarter, rising almost 36.7% year over year.Intel's collection of other, smaller businesses exhibited   strength as well, with the company's Internet of Things Group   sales advancing 8% to $919 million, its memory business rising   21% to $1.08 billion, and its programmable solutions group   expanding by 6% to $496 million. The first two businesses saw   operating profit improve to $321 million and $160 million, from   $146 million and a loss of $52 million in the year prior,   respectively. In the third segment, operating profit contracted   slightly to $106 million from $113 million in the same period   last year.Ultimately, Intel delivered an incredible quarter with   significant sales and profit growth, and its full-year outlook   was raised for the third time in three quarters. Both Intel and   its shareholders have cause to celebrate following the release of   these earnings results.  10 stocks we like better than Intel       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsReversing Wednesday's drubbing, the bulls stepped up to the plate on Thursday and sent the S&P 500 higher to the tune of 1.86%. It was a firm effort, but not yet a game-changing one. The bulls were backing off a bit as the closing bell approached, and after Wednesday's huge loss, some sort of bounce was inevitable.Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) shares did more than their fair share of the heavy lifting, gaining 9.9% in response to an unexpectedly strong third-quarter print . Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) provided a helping hand though, up 15% as its third-quarter earnings were up firmly and sales were better than expected despite a user-headcount headwind.At the other end of the spectrum were names like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ), which ended the day down more than 15% as the market processed the underlying meaning of the company's disappointing revenue guidance for the quarter currently underway. Advancers outnumbered decliners by a ratio of 2.5 to one, however, minimizing the impact that AMD other losers were able to make on the broad market.Regardless, the sheer severity of this week's volatility still makes it tough to get a read on most stock charts. But, some careful scouring of all the major names brings Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Mondelez International (NASDAQ: MDLZ ) to the forefront as trading prospects. Here's why.Intel shares were up firmly on Thursday after Wednesday's move to multiweek lows, and made that gain on higher volume. It's a pretty solid buy signal, even if there's more work to be done with it.Or, maybe it isn't. If the market rekindles its bigger downtrend, it's apt to take INTC stock lower with it, which could spark an even stronger selloff than the one we've seen since June.
 Click to Enlarge  • It's plotted on both stock charts, but the context means more on the weekly chart. That is, Thursday's low near $43.60 was also a major floor late last year and early this year. Under that level, there's no other support level to watch.• The backdrop is also already more bearish than it may seem on the surface. A closer look at the daily chart reveals all the key moving average lines have stopped and reversed rebound efforts at different times since June.• Still, until that last floor breaks, it could be dangerous to make assumptions.Apple was put into focus back on Oct. 11 , when it took a tumble and put a critical support level to the test. The stock ultimately broke below that floor, but not cleanly enough to put a full-blown selling wave into motion. In light of what has not happened in the meantime though, we have to acknowledge the possibility that we're still just one bad day away from the beginning of what could be a sizable pullback.The former horizontal line in the sand was $216.30, but has since been lowered to $214.40. It's only an approximation, or the average low for the past few weeks, but a line in the sand all the same.
 Click to Enlarge  • Although the horizontal support level is still holding up, notice that AAPL stock has been unable to push its way back above the blue 20-day moving average line despite several attempts over the course of the past two weeks.• The weekly chart has already given us a MACD sell signal, which usually doesn't happen until Apple shares are already en route to a lower low.Last but not least, Mondelez International shares didn't look like they were in too much trouble on Thursday, when they fell 1%. But, there are some subtle undertones in play here that suggest a little more weakness could trigger a sizable selloff.
 Click to Enlarge  • The last best chance for MDLZ stock to rebound was on Monday, when it tested the white 200-day moving average line as technical resistance; that test is circled on the daily chart. Rather than punch through it, shares fell again, to an established support level of $40.68.• It requires one to take a step back and look at the bigger-picture weekly chart, but from that vantage point it's clear that Mondelez is now in the early part of a downstroke within the confines of a falling trading range.• Notice how the volume-based trend indicators on both stock charts indicate that the volume here has actually been net-bearish since late last month.As of this writing, James Brumley held a long position in Ford Motor.

 By Amy Caren Daniel Oct 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks resumed their selloff on Friday, with the S&P poised to join the Nasdaq in correction territory, sparked by grim earnings reports from Alphabet and Amazon that eclipsed data showing the U.S. economy continued to grow at a healthy clip. The Nasdaq tumbled nearly 3 percent. The Dow sank 1.7 percent and the S&P 2.3 percent, with the S&P's session low taking it more than 10 percent below its Sept. 20 all-time closing high. If it closes at these levels, this would confirm a correction. The latest and, perhaps the most high-profile, came last night from Amazon.com Inc  and Alphabet Inc, two stocks that have helped power the equity markets decade-long bull run. Amazon tumbled 8.7 percent after it missed quarterly sales estimates and gave a below par holiday-season sales forecast, sparking a 3.07-percent plunge in the S&P consumer discretionary sector.  Google-parent Alphabet sank 4 percent after its revenue missed estimates, fanning concerns that regulatory scrutiny and competition would throttle its scorching pace of growth.  That triggered a drop in other members of the so-called FAANG group. Facebook Inc  fell 3.9 percent, Apple Inc slid  2.1 percent and Netflix Inc  dropped 5 percent. Apple led the S&P technology index  down 2.64 percent, while the communication services sector, home to the rest of the FAANGs, dropped 3.07 percent. "Expectations were really high going in to Google and Amazon's earnings. Investors were looking at their earnings to maybe prop up the market and get us out of this correction that we've been in," said Paul Brigandi, managing director and head of trading at Direxion in New York. "The correction was initially driven by interest rates and tariffs, so people were looking forward to earnings season to get us out of the downward trend we're in." The selloff got some respite from data showing U.S. gross domestic product growth slowed less than expected in the third quarter as a tariff-related drop in soybean exports was partially offset by the strongest consumer spending in nearly four years and a surge in inventory investment.  "Even though the GDP numbers were good, they only gave a temporary relief to the markets," said Brigandi. At 11:15 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was down 428.64 points, or 1.72 percent, at 24,555.91, the S&P 500  was down 61.93 points, or 2.29 percent, at 2,643.64 and the Nasdaq Composite  was down 215.49 points, or 2.94 percent, at 7,102.85. A clutch of weak outlooks on Wednesday pushed the Nasdaq into correction territory and erased the Dow and the S&P 500's gains for the year. On Thursday, Microsoft Corp's  strong earnings led a rally that pulled the S&P and the Dow back into the black for 2018. Intel Corp  stood out amid the carnage in technology stocks, jumping 3.1 percent after its better-than-expected quarterly results, though interim Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan said trade tensions with China could be a "headwind" next year.  Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 5.72-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 4.29-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded no new 52-week highs and 85 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded four new highs and 277 new lows.

 Oct 26 (Reuters) - Shares of Amazon.com Inc  fell 10 percent in trading before the bell on Friday after its sales outlook missed Wall Street targets, fanning concerns that the online retailer's expansion may finally be losing steam. The third quarter results late on Thursday was the second time running that billionaire Jeff Bezos' firm had fallen short of Wall Street's lofty sales targets, and the numbers sent a shockwave reverberating through global stock markets. The fall in shares, if replicated when U.S. stock markets open officially, would knock nearly $90 billion off Amazon's market value and relegate it behind Microsoft Corp  and Apple Inc  in terms of market value. Only three brokerages cut their price targets on the stock and four others raised their targets, saying Amazon's long-term growth story remained intact. "Shares are up 52 percent YTD, hence this kind of 'growth scare' is likely to weigh on sentiment in the near term, but ultimately will work itself out (likely by 1Q19)," Barclays analyst Ross Sandler wrote in a client note. The world's largest retailer is facing hurdles to boost sales in international markets as well as increased competition at home from the likes of Best Buy, Target Corp  and Walmart Inc, who are stepping up digital investments. Revenue from Amazon's international business, which brings in 27.5 percent of total sales, rose 13.4 percent in the third quarter, missing estimates, and decelerating from a 27 percent year-on-year expansion in the previous quarter. "We don't see any real structural issue with Amazon but nearly every line in the business is decelerating a tad, and we typically see another deceleration in retail in 4Q, hence are struggling to identify a catalyst," Sandler said. Amazon expected sales in the holiday quarter leading up to Christmas to rise between 10 percent and 20 percent, or up to $72.5 billion, while analysts were expecting $73.9 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  Its operating profit forecast of between $2.1 billion and $3.6 billion also came in below consensus estimates. Several analysts called the company's outlook conservative and said any outright dip in profit seems highly unlikely. "Overall, Amazon's growth trajectory remains solid, including advertising, grocery, pharmacy, and specialty retail, as well as Amazon Business ($10 billion in sales in eight countries) and Amazon Web Services," Telsey Advisory Group analysts said. Shares of the company were down 9.7 percent at $1,610 in trading before the bell. 
 
Futures sink as Amazon, Alphabet spark fresh selloff ahead of GDP data
US STOCKS-Futures sink as Amazon, Alphabet spark fresh selloff ahead of GDP data
Like most stock market corrections that come out of nowhere, they don't take their time inflicting the damage.The express elevator going down to maximum pain only stops at a few floors to let well-prepared investors off.The rest are found selling in a panic near the bottom. This October correction has been no different and now it's time to sift through the wreckage and see if it's safe to buy yet.In the video that accompanies this article, I take a look at 3 of my favorite indicators for signaling extremes in pessimism that usually mark a near-term capitulation.The 3 indicators are...The S&P 500 Percent of Stocks Above Their 200-DayThe Total Put-Call RatioThe S&P 1500 New Highs-New Lows Percent IndexI look at 5-year charts of all three so you can see a good comparison to prior peaks of pessimism, especially those during the sideways markets of 2015-16 where we went through a six-quarter earnings recession.I also explain the quantitative logic of institutional investors who use some variation of the Equity Risk Premium (ERP) model to value equities as interest rates rise and growth slows from its torrid pace.Macro Angst and the ERP SolutionSo let's talk about what has some investors getting "less bold" about the late-cycle bull market -- and thus less apt to buy this correction aggressively -- as if the top is in and we go sideways for 6-12 months (just like 2015-16) unless/until earnings stage another surge.First, let's look at EPS growth projections. This is an update of Sheraz's chart I've been showing you all year as it implies "peak growth" and "as good as it gets" conclusions...The "half glass" debate investors will continue to have is whether we focus on 2019 still offering y-o-y growth on top of "impossible" comparables from Q1 and Q2 2018 (half full) or we focus on steep declines in the rate of growth that could be foreshadowing a boom gone bust (half empty).Those bears at Morgan Stanley, led by chief investment officer Mike Wilson, are definitely still focused on half empty. That's what I talked about on TDAmeritrade-TV on Tuesday using this table which I will explain in detail...Recall that Equity Risk Premium is a measure of how much extra investors want to be paid over the risk-free rate. For example, if the 10-year bond is at 3%, investors may want to be paid double that -- 600 basis points, or 6% -- another 300 basis points more to justify owning equities.The way that you calculate and use this data involves only a few simple steps...1) First, flip the P/E of the S&P 500 into its "earnings yield" so you have an apples-to-apples basis against the bond. This table uses the consensus estimate for 2019 of $174 EPS. At S&P 2800, that's a P/E of 16X. Flipped into its earnings yield, we get 174/2800 = 0.062, or 6.2%.2) 6.2% sounds like a great return from stocks. Alas, intelligent investors subtract the risk-free rate so they know how much better they are actually doing for taking all the extra risk of stocks. 6.2% minus 3% (assumed 10-yr yield) leaves 320 basis points.3) Using the right side of the Morgan Stanley table, we can assume how different institutional investors who have a choice of various ERPs (equity risk premiums) might think and allocate. If an investor wants only 300 basis points premium over the 3% risk-free rate, then he calls S&P 2906 "fair value" and would be a buyer below there .4) What if we have a conservative investor who wants 350 basis points of premium over a projected 3.25% 10-year? Now you are talking 675 basis points. Back that into our equation and you get a much lower S&P: 174/.0675 = 2578 (roughly in line with their 2583 in table).As you can read at the bottom of the tables, Morgan Stanley strategists believe the S&P 500 will be stuck in this 2,600 to 2,900 range for a while as the 10-year ranges 3-3.25% and investors want 300-350 bps cushion.Which is really this "code" for their hedge fund clients: "We are probably going to S&P 2500, where we will gladly buy it. But not here, not now."Gaming the Correction, Ignoring the Crash TheoriesI put this analysis together last week and presented it on TD-Ameritrade TV on October 16, a day when the S&P 500 had a big rally back above 2800.And I convinced myself that Mike Wilson and his team were really on to something about the new risks in this market with "peak growth" ideas and EPS estimates too high at $174.So, on October 19, I set a minimum correction target for the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) to fill the May 7 gap at 6770. My worst-case scenario was just under 6600. To capture that move, on Monday we bought the ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ 3X Bear ETFSQQQ when the NDX was around 7150.On Wednesday the 24th, the NDX dropped to 6777, about a 5% downdraft which handed us 15% open gains in SQQQ. But those gains are hard to capture unless you grab them on the big days where the market closes red. That's why targets and plans are so vital.I also told my followers it's safe to buy down there as long as AppleAAPL , MicrosoftMSFT , and AmazonAMZN continue to lead the market.Because I didn't see a market "crash" on the horizon and believed we were deeply in the lower third of the correction alreadywhere institutional investors (other than Morgan Stanley) would be aggressively buying the S&P 500 under 2700.One of our favorite vehicles to quickly and economically "grab that fear and buy it" is the opposite of SQQQ, the ProShares UltraPro QQQ 3X Bull ETFTQQQ .Since I believe the market is close to a bottom, getting long growth is still the way to play a classic Q4 rally.Be sure to watch the video to learn more about how large investors are using Equity Risk Premium on a longer-term basis as the 2019 rates of growth for the economy and earnings get called into question.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the TAZR Trader service.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?

5 Top Stock Trades for Friday: Trading Amazon Earnings
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter a violent decline on Wednesday, the stock market is in rebound mode this Thursday. The question is whether these gains will hold and whether we've put in a bottom. Traders are mixed on the indices, so let's turn our attention to our top stock trades in individual securities.With strong results out of the cloud and an impressive quarterly report all around , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is helping to lead to rebound in tech. If only Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) can help with the task.Along with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Microsoft is one of a few companies that hasn't tested its 200-day moving average during this pullback. With Thursday's post-earnings rally, it's not clear if it will. Further, the $102.50 level held as support, giving short-term traders a level to shoot against on the long side.Now over the 100-day, see how MSFT handles both the 50-day and the backside of its prior uptrend. A failure at either point would be cause for concern in the short term.We finally got the 200-day test in Amazon, something we have been waiting for during this entire correction . Shares were up more than $120 or 7.4% on Thursday, limiting the potential upside following its results. So where does that leave us?Well, Amazon just reported earnings and the initial reaction is not a good one. The stock is already down 6%.On the downside, look to see if Amazon can stay above Wednesday's lows and above the 200-day moving average. If there's a turnaround, look to see how AMZN handles that $1,850 level. Just a few percentage points above current levels, it's an important area.For starters, this level has been significant in the past, as we can see dating back to July. Further, it's where Amazon's bounce stalled out earlier this month. Lastly, it's the backside of its prior uptrend.That setup is similar to Microsoft and it's not a great sign to see prior support and uptrend acting as resistance. Let's see if we get a rally over this mark, a rally and fail or a pullback.Visa (NYSE: V ) reported solid earnings and provided guidance for fiscal 2019 that excited investors.This stock has been in a very solid uptrend for the better part of two years. We don't even really need trend lines. Investors have done very well buying on corrections to the 50-day and 100-day moving averages.By most accounts the 200-day moving average should be decent support. V could overshoot this level, but as we said earlier this week , $20 off its highs and V looks attractive. Another shot down here is worth taking.One of October's better-performing stocks, Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) is getting a big boost Thursday, up 15% on earnings . $28 really proved itself as support. However, the 200-day smacked shares down significantly.So what now?Basically in the middle of Thursday's massive range, we need to see which way Twitter shares are going to break. If the market stays in rally mode, Twitter can take out its highs and perhaps run to the 100-day moving average.On a pullback, I'd love another shot at Twitter near $28.From top to bottom, shares of Nvidia fell about $100 this month, marking a decline of almost 35%. That's rather remarkable for a company growing the way Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) is and a company that's leading in so many different categories.In any regard, seeing the stock plummet to the low-$190s before snapping back and rallying on the day is actually good news for bulls. Particularly on a day where Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) plunged on earnings .With the decline, NVDA actually went negative on the year and gave up all of its gains over the past 12 months. Bouncing now, the key will be to stay over Thursday's low. Below that and Nvidia will fall into no man's land. On the upside, the $250 level has become significant, which would roughly coincide with a retest of the 200-day moving average. See how it does near this mark.However, the decline is seriously overdone for such a well-run company. What changed over the last 25 days to drive such a decline? Not much.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell .

2 New Apple Products on the Horizon
  Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) regularly introduces new products. In fact, at a   product launch event on Oct. 30, we're likely to see the company   introduce updated Macs and redesigned versions of the company's   high-end iPad Pro products.Two other products that may not necessarily launch during the   Oct. 30 event are also apparently on the way, according to   respected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo with TF International   Securities.The first, Kuo says, is an updated version of Apple's iPad   Mini product line. The current iPad Mini 4 that made its   commercial debut in late 2015   hasn't been upgraded since then    .  Image source: Apple.The second is the company's AirPower charging mat. Apple   previewed AirPower during its iPhone launch event last year and   said it would become available in 2018. But as my colleague Evan   Niu   points out    , "Apple has reportedly run into technical challenges in   developing the device, with it overheating."As for the refreshed iPad Mini, MacRumors'   summary    of Kuo's report says that it'll "feature an upgraded processor   and a lower-cost [display] panel." MacRumors also says Kuo "does   not know ... if Apple will announce it during the [October 30]   media event or launch it sometime later in the year/early next   year.""According to Kuo, Apple could launch new AirPods and the   AirPower either late in the fourth quarter of 2018 or early in   the first quarter of 2019," MacRumors wrote.As we consider some of the expectations around the new iPad   Mini, I'll explain why bringing AirPower to market would be a   positive for the company.An upgraded processor for a new iPad Mini is practically a   given, since the current model has an A8 chip that's more than   four years old. At a minimum, I'd expect Apple to endow a new   iPad Mini with the A10 Fusion chip that powers the current   9.7-inch iPad. That's far from Apple's state of the art in chip   design, considering the company introduced the   A12 Bionic    back in September, but it would still be a massive step up from   the A8.Not only would the A10 Fusion deliver a big jump in both CPU   and graphics performance over the A8, but it also has a superior   image signal processor, which could help Apple deliver camera   upgrades with the new iPad Mini.Apple could potentially use the newer A11 Bionic chip, but the   likelihood depends on the launch timing of the device. If the new   iPad Mini comes out before Apple gets a chance to update the   9.7-inch iPad, then an A11 Bionic would seem to be out of the   question, as it'd make the new iPad Mini superior to the 9.7-inch   iPad in a significant way.However, if Apple updates the iPad Mini the next time it   updates the 9.7-inch iPad, it could make sense for Apple to endow   both new devices with the A11 Bionic, since the next logical   upgrade for the 9.7-inch iPad would be the A11 Bionic from the   A10 Fusion that currently powers it.Kuo makes mention of a display panel that's cheaper than the   one used in the current iPad Mini. Today, Apple sells the iPad   Mini 4 with 128 GB of storage for $399 -- just $29 cheaper than   its more advanced 9.7-inch counterpart. I wouldn't be surprised   if the upgraded iPad Mini were explicitly aimed at significantly   lower price points than the iPad Mini 4 is.The display on the iPad Mini 4 has the same number of pixels   as the display on the standard iPad but in a smaller area,   translating into higher pixel density and, therefore, a sharper   screen, than on the 9.7-inch model. I wouldn't be surprised to   see the rumored iPad Mini upgrade come with a display that offers   fewer pixels than the current model, yet enough to achieve the   same pixel density as on the 9.7-inch model, to cut costs and   potentially even improve battery life.One of the key selling points of Apple's iPhone 8-series and   iPhone X smartphones was the inclusion of wireless charging   capability. While owners of those and newer devices can use   third-party wireless charging accessories, the advertised   capabilities of the AirPower charging mat seemed quite   compelling. Moreover, the accessory could not only drive   incremental revenue for Apple in the form of direct AirPower   product sales, but it could also   help sell owners of older iPhones on the   advantages of buying a new iPhone with wireless charging   capabilities    .To that end, I'm encouraged by Kuo's claim that Apple still   plans to bring this accessory to market, even if it winds up   coming later than expected.  10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

7 Stocks to Buy for Real Pricing Power
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI hear the phrase "that stock's got real pricing power" a lot. But what does it mean? And how do you identify the stocks to buy with real pricing power?Does McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ) have real pricing power? Probably not. What they have is a duplicatable system. That's equally important. However, when you can own a stock that has both, you've hit the investment jackpot.What about Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX )?Its stock's getting pummeled as I write this, down 12% over the past five days of trading. Shouldn't a company with pricing power resist market corrections?Not a chance. Investors get nervous. Stocks go down. That's especially true for those up 75% year to date as Netflix was before this week's selloff.But back to pricing power.Warren Buffett's partner Charlie Munger gave a speech in 2003 to a group of business students at the University of California Santa Barbara in which he described how a friend who had a product that was selling poorly despite being the best on the market. He raised the price by 20%, consumers began to value it more, and sales went way up.The stocks to buy with real pricing power are those that can raise prices almost with impunity. Here are the seven I think you'll want to consider.While it's true that Netflix stock has gotten a haircut in recent days, every investor would love to have its three-year annualized total return of 45%.It got that kind of returns, in part, because of its pricing power."What's less talked about is the strong pricing power Netflix has shown over the past 5 years since announcing its first price increase in May 2014, growing pricing globally at a 5% clip (7% in the US) since," Arif Karim, senior investment analyst at Ensemble Capital, stated in a must-read October article in Intrinsic Investing . "Despite this increase in prices, it has continued to show very strong momentum  in signing up new customers for its service around the world."Since 2011, Netflix has grown subscribers by 30% compounded annually. In Q3 2018, it increased paid memberships by 5.4% from Q2 2018 and 25% year over year.While the U.S. growth has slowed, international streaming grew by 39% year-over-year with plenty of the world still to cover.Figuring out how to keep growing at this kind of pace is a nice problem to have if you're Reed Hastings.Warren Buffett, like Charlie Munger, is a big believer in owning companies with pricing power."The single most important decision in evaluating a business is pricing power. If you've got the power to raise prices without losing business to a competitor, you've got a very good business," Buffett stated in 2011. "And if you have to have a prayer session before raising the price by 10 percent, then you've got a terrible business."You can always count on Warren for a good quote.Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is a classic example of a business that can raise prices without losing business.Whether it be through an increase in its Prime membership - in 2014, Amazon upped the annual fee by $20 to $99 and in 2018, it raised the monthly fee by $2 to $13 - or by using artificial intelligence to find products that customers are less resistant to price increases and promoting the heck out of them.The reality is that pricing power isn't just about being able to raise prices with impunity, it's also about getting your best customers to spend more.Prime customers spend $1,700 annually, more than double the number ($700) for non-Prime members. As long as it keeps adding Prime members and gets them to spend more on an annual basis, little incremental price increases here and there will add up to significant revenue and profit growth.I wasn't sure whether I should put Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) on the list of stocks to buy with real pricing power.I get that people like Warren Buffett are investing in the company because they believe it has real pricing power, but one has to wonder how much customers will be willing to pay in the future to own an iPhone.Here in Canada, the most expensive iPhone, the 512GB version of the XS MAX, is CAD$1,999 . Not a chance in the world I'm paying 2K for a phone.However, Buffett sees it differently."I have a plane that costs me a lot, a million dollars a year or something of the sort. If I used the iPhone - I use an iPad a lot - if I used the iPhone like all my friends do, I would rather give up the plane," Buffett said on CNBC in August. "Now it's got competition so you can't push the price, but in terms of its utility to people and what they get for a thousand dollars…you can have a dinner party that would cost that, and here this is, and what it does for you, it's incredible."He's a lot smarter than I'll ever be, so I'm going to accept his opinion that pricing power entails more than just an ability to raise prices; it also speaks to the power of Apple to keep its buyers addicted to its products.Morgan Stanley  analyst Vincent Andrews talked up Sherwin-Williams' (NYSE: SHW ) pricing power in February 2016. Trading around $255 at the time, he had a 12-month target price of $305, which it hit precisely one year later.Here's what he had to say on the subject:"We expect Sherwin-Williams to exhibit pricing power as we continue to move through a period of sustained raw material deflation. Sherwin retained price in 2015 so as to drive +280bps of incremental gross margin gains, and we expect the company to benefit further in 2016 as the coatings raw material environment remains similarly accommodating," Andrews suggested at the time. "Sherwin's pricing power relates to its control of its own distribution, as well as its outsized leverage to professional painting contractors. The contractor-serviced architectural paint market has historically been characterized by robust levels of pricing power."While inflation has crept into raw material prices reducing Sherwin-Williams' ability to expand margins by 2-3% annually, I do think the second portion of the argument remains intact.In the quarter ended September 30, SHW was able to increase prices. However, because of higher raw material costs, its gross margin improved by just 30 basis points and over the first nine months it declined by 270 basis points to 42.6%.Ultimately, I think its purchase of Valspar will turn out to be a good one, providing it with some level of pricing power in the future.Movie theater stocks like Cinemark (NYSE: CNK ) haven't had an easy go of it over the past five years. Cinemark's annualized total return of 7% is 437 basis points less than the S&P 500 .Pricing power hasn't been the problem.Instead, poor content has contributed to lower attendance, combined with a desire by some consumers to enjoy alternative experiences.I believe people will always crave an occasional in-theater experience. Attendance tends to be something that goes in ebbs and flows. One year it's way up and the next it's way down. Content is the most significant influence on those numbers.As for pricing power, movie theaters like Cinemark have it in abundance. You wouldn't see average ticket prices rise every year if they didn't.Cinemark is in the process of raising prices to cover the cost of seating upgrades it's made."Our average ticket price also increased 3.7 percent to $8.08, largely as a result of inflation, incremental pricing opportunities associated with recliner conversions, and favorable adult-versus-child ticket type mix,"  said  Chief Financial Officer Sean Gamble.The fact is, if you're a movie theater and you're not raising prices, you'll likely be out of business sooner rather than later.The beauty of cigarette makers like Altria (NYSE: MO ) is that despite a declining global customer base there are always those die-hard smokers willing to pay almost any price to get their fix.I wouldn't own a cigarette stock, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't. Cigarette makers are incredible generators of free cash flow, in large part, because they CAN raise prices almost at will.Altria is said to be raising the price of a carton of Marlboro cigarettes by $1 - or 10 cents a pack. That's the second increase of the year. In March, it raised prices by nine cents a pack."We believe pricing will remain a critical driver of revenue and earnings growth, particularly as manufacturers realize almost 3 times the leverage on earnings from a point of pricing than a point of volume," Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said in September.If you're an income investor and can wrap your head around owning a stock that manufactures "death sticks," the 5.1% yield - it's the highest level since 2012 - is enticing. Like Amazon, Costco (NASDAQ: COST ) relies on its membership fees to generate significant revenues for the warehouse retailer.Here's what I had to say about Costco in 2012 ."Many people think Costco is in the business of selling products at low prices. While its prices are indeed low, that's not its ultimate goal. Its real business is selling memberships at $55 a pop or more. As long as it keeps providing great products (the chicken is awesome) at good prices, it will continue to increase its membership."At the time, Costco was generating about 75% of its operating income from membership fees. Today, it's around 69% , which is still an unusually high number. Yet, it's only raised its membership prices once (2017) since 2011.How's that pricing power? Well, directly, it's not.However, what Costco does well, like Amazon, is getting more people to join who then spend more money each year, driving up the annual revenue per customer.Meanwhile, Costco constantly pushes its suppliers on prices, passing its cost savings to customers, who benefit from lower prices.Keep your customers happy, and they'll ultimately spend more as the years pass.Costco doesn't need to raise prices because its profitability is solely built around its membership fees.It's a brilliant business model.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post 7 Stocks to Buy for Real Pricing Power appeared first on InvestorPlace .

 By Sonam Rai and Stephen Nellis Oct 25 (Reuters) - Intel Corp  beat analysts' estimates for quarterly profit and revenue on Thursday, driven by its high-margin data center business and strong demand for its PC chips, sending its shares up as much as 6.0 percent in extended trading, though those gains later evaporated on concerns about U.S. trade tensions with China. The company's 39 percent rise in profits and better-than-expected fourth-quarter forecast should come as a relief for investors after three days of grim news from other major chipmakers that have shaken stock markets globally. Intel executives do not see any near-term weakness from the trade tensions or Chinese economy, despite the fact that large data center customers like Baidu Inc  and consumer PC factories are located there. But Intel's share gains in extended trading diminished to less than 1 percent when Interim Chief Executive Bob Swan said trade tensions could be a "headwind" in the longer term next year. Texas Instruments Inc, STMicroelectronics NV  and SK Hynix  have all warned of slowing demand for the remainder of the year.  Intel bucked the trend thanks to strong sales of chips for PCs, the second quarter in the row the company benefited from the sector after years of stagnation in that business, and increasing sales of iPhone modem chips. Swan told Reuters the PC chip strength came from computer purchases by business customers in developed economies as well as gamers building high-end machines. Many businesses are upgrading their PCs because Microsoft Corp  has said it will end support for some older versions of Windows in early 2020. At first, Intel's results seemed to allay concerns that a trade conflict between the United States and China or a slowdown in the Chinese economy could drag down the global chip business. "We'll be working with our domestic Chinese customers and our global [PC manufacturers] to adjust and adapt the supply chain to deal with constraints," Swan told Reuters in an interview before holding a conference call with analysts. But later on the call, Swan conceded that the trade tensions could a "headwind" for Intel in 2019, though the company has not specified how much sales could suffer. Also boosting Intel sales this quarter was its business for modems, which connect smart phones to wireless data networks which was up 131 percent in the quarter. The gain resulted from Intel completely replacing rival modem supplier Qualcomm Inc  in the most recent models of Apple Inc's. But Swan said the modem sales are also pressuring Intel's margins and contributed to the firm lowering its fourth-quarter operating margin outlook to 34.5 percent. "That being said, what the modems and memory do for the company is allow us to play in a much larger market," he said. Intel forecast current-quarter revenue of $19 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.22 per share. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $18.40 billion and a profit of $1.09 per share, according to Refinitiv data. Intel has been increasingly catering to a booming data center market as revenue from PCs has flattened since 2011. Revenue from its data center business rose 25.9 percent to $6.14 billion in the quarter, while analysts were expecting revenue of $5.89 billion, according to financial and data analytics firm FactSet. Rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc, which has been gaining ground with its new EPYC chips for servers, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday but forecast fourth-quarter revenue below estimates due to falling demand for its graphics chips from cryptocurrency miners.  Revenue in Intel's client computing business, which caters to PC makers and is still the biggest contributor to sales, also rose 15.5 percent to $10.23 billion, beating FactSet estimates of $9.33 billion. Intel's PC sales have trended positive in recent quarters, lifted by stronger demand. Many businesses have started the process of buying new PCs because Microsoft Corp  has said it will end support for Windows 7 in early 2020. "There's been really strong demand for both the consumer and enterprise for PCs which helped. They also did a great job managing through some supply disruptions," said Elazar Advisors analyst Chaim Siegel. Intel recorded a $290 million charge as a result of Micron Technology Inc's  decision to buy out Intel's portion of a memory fabrication plant in Utah where the two had partnered to build advanced memory chips, a move analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy called "negotiation tactics." He expects the two to find a way to work together. Intel's Swan told Reuters that Intel has retained its rights to the technology and intends to eventually build its own factories to produce the chips. "Despite their announcement, we will still have access to supply from the fab for the next 18 to 24 months, and that will give us time to explore the alternatives we have to produce the product," Swan said. On an conference call with investors, Swan said he expected capital expenditures on memory chips to be "a little bit lower" in 2019 "despite building self sufficiency" after Micron's move. Net income rose to $6.40 billion, or $1.38 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 29 from $4.52 billion, or 94 cents per share, a year earlier (graphic). Excluding items, the company earned $1.40 per share. Net revenue rose 18.7 percent to $19.16 billion. Analysts on average were expecting adjusted earnings of $1.15 per share and revenue of $18.11 billion. 
 
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs the markets have seen massive swoons lately, one of the biggest victims has become the tech sector.When markets rose, tech equities became stocks to buy as this sector brought the innovation and often the profit growth needed to attract investors. Now, in a falling market, this dynamic has worked against tech. Investors sold off names such as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) as valuations began to matter. Others have suffered as self-inflicted wounds, and the U.S.-China trade war, pushed traders out of many tech stocks.As a result, many of these tech names trade at a substantial discount from their former highs. Some have become stocks to buy by virtue of modest price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios. Anyone wanting to profit from the current market pessimism should consider these tech equities as some of the best stocks to buy now:Despite its huge fan base, and $1.06 trillion market cap, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock continues to suffer from a relative lack of respect. It tends not to command a high valuation despite boasting the largest cash hoard among publicly traded companies and its continued profit growth.Admittedly, Apple has not replaced the creative edge it lost after the passing of Steve Jobs. Still, I expect with its position in the device market, it will continue to play a substantial role in driving tech innovation. Its largest sales driver, the iPhone, continues to drive sales and profits for the company.Moreover, the rise of 5G by itself will inspire yet another replacement cycle in iPhones over the next few years. And 5G could easily drive the need for new hardware or replacement cycles in other Apple products as well. Also, that does not consider other tech advances that could ensure the growth of AAPL for years to come.Despite a P/E ratio of 19.9 and predicted profit growth of 27.9% for this year, AAPL stock suffered along with its tech peers. Still, given these numbers, AAPL stock should remain on a stocks to buy list, particularly on a pullback. With a low P/E, high profit growth and its massive cash reserves, AAPL stock should prosper for years to come.Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) dominates the social media space and has become a major player in the world of online ads. As it's the owner of four of the six apps with over one billion downloads, few have presented a competitive threat to this company.However, a series of setbacks has made 2018 the worst year for FB stock since its IPO in 2012. The Cambridge Analytica scandal and accusations of political bias and Russian collusion dogged FB stock earlier this year. It also suffered the largest one-day market cap loss in the history of the market following its August earnings report. More recently, the founders of Instagram and WhatsApp parted ways with the company.However, despite its tarnished reputation, I see nobody who can compete with Facebook. Weibo (NASDAQ: WB ) and QQ operate only in China. Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) remains a niche play. Snap (NYSE: SNAP ) has seen many of its key features copied by Facebook.In addition to its competitive situation, Facebook's multiple has become compelling. Due to its recent challenges, FB stock has fallen by nearly one-third from its 52-week high. The stock now trades at a P/E under 21. This comes despite a predicted profit growth rate of 33% this year and 15.5% for fiscal 2019.The fact that Facebook counts a substantial percentage of the world's population as users creates questions on where to find further growth. However, the company's $42 billion cash hoard leaves the firm with options to build or buy new growth centers.Though its scandals bring embarrassment and bearish sentiments, most firms tend to survive such challenges. Moreover, with the relatively low P/E and a continuation of double-digit profit growth for the foreseeable future, I believe the recent plunge has made FB one of the smart stocks to buy.Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), once the world's largest chipmaker, has struggled to return to prominence since PCs fell out of favor. The company responded to the decline in PCs by moving to become a firm focused on data centers and the Internet of Things (IoT). While the company appears to have a viable plan to redefine itself, computer viruses and management turmoil have weighed on the stock in 2018.Moreover, Intel has failed to maintain the dominance it enjoyed in the PC era. AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ) played little brother to Intel for most of its history. However, it has bested INTC in many areas lately. Also, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) took the lead on chips related to artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR). This forced Intel to partner with archrival AMD to compete in this area.Still, while it has fallen behind, I think the selling in INTC stock has gone too far. INTC now trades at just over 11 times forward earnings. Moreover, Wall Street predicts an increase in net income of 20.2% for this year. They also expect average annual growth of 10.2% per year over the next five years.Not only will stockholders enjoy a low P/E, but they will also receive payment while they wait for a recovery. Its annual dividend of $1.20 per share offers a yield to about 2.7%. Also, the previous history indicates this payout will rise in most years.Without a doubt, in the chip industry, Intel has gone from dominant player to formidable competitor. Still, Intel has positioned itself to remain one of the more significant players in the data center and IoT industries. With a high dividend and a P/E ratio flirting with the single digits, INTC stock has become one of the more intriguing stocks to buy in the tech industry.Few American companies have seen more pain from the ongoing U.S.-China trade war than Micron (NASDAQ: MU ). The memory chipmaker had enjoyed a rising stock price as a result of high memory prices. However, the trade war cast doubt on this market, and MU stock has fallen since.In previous articles , I called MU stock a "proxy for memory chip prices." As such, I sold my stake in the company when I saw prices come down. Indeed, MU now trades about 45% below its 52-week high.I also recommend this with some hesitation, since I recently called MU stock a sell. However, the stock has fallen an additional 15% since I made that call.Furthermore, valuations have become too compelling to ignore. Analysts forecast consensus profits of $10.51 per share for fiscal 2019. While that represents a drop from the $11.95 per share seen in 2018, it leaves the P/E ratio at only 3.4 times earnings!That said, analysts forecast memory prices will continue to fall, taking Micron's profit margins down as well. Only one analyst has attempted to predict profits in fiscal 2021. While this early prediction of $3.53 in earnings would represent a massive drop, it still leaves the 2021 forward P/E at only about 10 times earnings.Historically, Micron often lost money in times of low memory prices. If MU stock is indeed turning into a money loser, investors need to stay out. But as long as profit forecasts and memory prices hold, MU remains one of the stocks to buy in the tech sector.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

The market expects Apple (AAPL) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2018. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of iPhones, iPads and other products is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.77 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +33.8%.Revenues are expected to be $61.36 billion, up 16.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.21% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseEarnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Apple?For Apple, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.35%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Apple will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Apple would post earnings of $2.17 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.34, delivering a surprise of +7.83%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Apple appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.
Is Schwab Fundamental U.S. Broad Market Index ETF (FNDB) a Hot ETF Right Now?
The Schwab Fundamental U.S. Broad Market Index ETF (FNDB) was launched on 08/13/2013, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs category of the market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?For a long time now, the ETF industry has been flooded with products based on market capitalization weighted indexes, which are designed to represent the broader market or a particular market segment.Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.There are some investors, though, who think it's possible to beat the market with great stock selection; this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta, which track non-cap weighted strategies.Non-cap weighted indexes try to choose stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, which is based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a mix of other such characteristics.The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.Fund Sponsor & IndexBecause the fund has amassed over $254.73 M, this makes it one of the larger ETFs in the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs. FNDB is managed by Charles Schwab . Before fees and expenses, this particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI US Index.The Russell RAFI US Index measures the performance of the constituent companies by fundamental overall company scores.Cost & Other ExpensesFor ETF investors, expense ratios are an important factor when considering a fund's return; in the long-term, cheaper funds actually have the ability to outperform their more expensive cousins if all other things remain the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.25%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.16%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector - about 15.20% of the portfolio. Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.Taking into account individual holdings, Apple Inc Common Stock Usd.00001 (AAPL) accounts for about 3.65% of the fund's total assets, followed by Exxon Mobil Corp Common Stock (XOM) and Chevron Corp Common Stock Usd.75 (CVX).FNDB's top 10 holdings account for about 18.62% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskYear-to-date, the Schwab Fundamental U.S. Broad Market Index ETF has lost about -0.82% so far, and it's up approximately 4.26% over the last 12 months (as of 10/25/2018). FNDB has traded between $35.32 and $40.14 in this past 52-week period.The fund has a beta of 0.99 and standard deviation of 11.54% for the trailing three-year period, which makes FNDB a medium risk choice in this particular space. With about 1572 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental U.S. Broad Market Index ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.Invesco High Yield Equity Dividend Achievers ETF (PEY) tracks NASDAQ US Dividend Achievers 50 Index and the iShares Core S&P U.S. Value ETF (IUSV) tracks S&P 900 Value Index. Invesco High Yield Equity Dividend Achievers ETF has $748.21 M in assets, iShares Core S&P U.S. Value ETF has $4.34 B. PEY has an expense ratio of 0.54% and IUSV charges 0.04%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center .

 BEIJING, Oct 25 (Reuters) - China's foreign ministry has some suggestions for the Trump administration if it is worried about foreign eavesdropping on the U.S. president's iPhones: use a Huawei handset instead. Or just cut all forms of modern communication with the outside world. The riposte came after the New York Times reported that American intelligence reports indicated that Chinese and Russian spies often listen in on President Donald Trump when he uses his Apple  cellphones to chat with old friends. Trump called the Times report incorrect on Thursday, and dismissed it as "long and boring." "I only use Government Phones, and have only one seldom used government cell phone. Story is soooo wrong!" Trump wrote on Twitter. In a later tweet, he said, "I rarely use a cellphone, & when I do it's government authorized. I like Hard Lines. Just more made up Fake News!" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying also dismissed the Times story, calling such reports "evidence that the New York Times makes fake news." Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, she also offered two suggestions apparently aimed at the Trump administration. "If they are really very worried about Apple phones being bugged, then they can change to using Huawei," she said, referring to China's biggest telecommunications equipment maker. "If they are still not at ease, then in order to have an entirely secure device, they can stop using all forms of modern communication devices and cut off all ties with the outside world." The Times cited current and former U.S. officials as saying China has a sophisticated approach toward the intercepted presidential phone calls and is seeking to use them to determine what Trump thinks, whom he listens to and how best to sway him. In particular, it is trying to use what it learns to prevent the current trade war between the two countries from escalating further, the Times said. While China's recommendation of Huawei phones may have been  tongue-in-cheek, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd  has come under scrutiny in the United States. Intelligence agency leaders and others have said they are concerned that Huawei and other Chinese companies may be beholden to the Chinese government or ruling Communist Party, raising the risk of espionage. The U.S. Democratic National Committee warned party candidates running in November elections not to use devices from Huawei or ZTE, another major Chinese telecoms gear maker. Concerns have been raised on several occasions this year about cellphone surveillance activity in the Washington area. The Department of Homeland Security said in a letter to several senators in March that it had observed activity in Washington consistent with mobile subscriber identity catchers. Trump repeatedly excoriated his Democratic rival in the 2016 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton, on the issue of secure communications, rebuking her for her use of a private email address and server while she was secretary of state.

 By Stratos Karakasidis Oct 25 (Reuters) - Shares in BE Semiconductor Industries (Besi) jumped over 6 percent on Thursday,reversing earlier lossesas resilience in the company's profit margins offset investor concern over its sales outlook.     Besi shares had fallen 8 percent in early trade after it said it expects fourth-quarter sales to drop up to 25 percent compared with the previous quarter, in the face of a potential slowdown in the semiconductor market. The company, which supplies chipmakers with semiconductor assembly equipment, reported a drop of 27.6 percent in third-quarter revenue compared to the second quarter, partially due to a fall in die bonding shipments for mobile applications.   However, its third quarter gross margin of 58.0 percent was higher than the second quarter figure of 56.5 percent, mainly due to a more favorable product mix, the company said. ING analysts said the fourth quarter guidance was much weaker than expected but profitability was holding up better than expected. "BESI reported a solid gross margin and took aggressive cost measures which we find both impressive but also show that the company wants to be positioned in case the downturn is prolonged," they said in a note. A Paris-based trader also pointed to resilience in the margin as helping the stock, adding that free cash flow was good because Besi had improved its cost structure in recent years. Shares in other companies in the sector were also trading higher, with ASML  up 2.5 percent and ASM International  up 1.6 percent. Fears of falling demand in the semiconductor sector had dragged down chipmakers' shares over the past few months. Franco-Italian company STMicroelectronics, a supplier for Apple  and Tesla, warned on Wednesday  of slowing demand in China. The Dutch manufacturer said revenue for July-September was 116.7 million euros ($133.12 million) and orders dropped by 33 percent compared with the same period of 2017 due to lower demand for mobile and high performance computing applications.

 By Sijia Jiang HONG KONG, Oct 25 (Reuters) - China'sWingtech Technology Co Ltd, the world's largest smartphone contract manufacturer, is acquiring Dutch semiconductor firm Nexperia Holding by buying a majority stake from its Chinese owners for 25.2 billion yuan ($3.63 billion). Wingtech, a contract manufacturer for China's largest smartphone companies including Huawei Technologies  and Xiaomi Corp, said in a stock exchange filing late on Wednesday it plans to pay 18.45 billion yuan to buy stakes from Nexperia owners.  Wingtech will indirectly own 75.86 percent of Nexperia as a result of the deals, it said. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval including from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The acquisition will value Nexperia at 35.1 billion yuan ($5.06 billion), around one-and-a-half times the $2.1 billion a consortium of Chinese buyers paid for it in 2016, the filing said. Wingtech said in the filing it is the world's largest smartphone original design manufacturer (ODM) by volume, with more than 10 percent of the global market share. Nexperia is a component supplier in the semiconductor industry, with clients including Apple Inc  and Samsung Electronics. According to the filing, Wingtech aims to raise up to 4.63 billion yuan in a private placement to fund the deal. Its shares have been suspended since April. Wingtech said it plans to get into automotive electronics after the deal is completed, currently Nexperia's largest business, as it seeks to benefit from business demand from more sectors in the 5G era. Chinese regulators earlier this year thwarted Qualcomm Inc's$44 billion deal to buy NXP amid escalating trade tensions between China and the United States.  ($1 = 6.9433 Chinese yuan renminbi) 
 
SK Hynix warns of more chip price falls, capex cut as trade tensions bite
 By Ju-min Park and Heekyong Yang SEOUL, Oct 25 (Reuters) - SK Hynix  offered a downbeat outlook for semiconductors on Thursday, warning prices of flash memory chips will fall further until early next year from over two-year lows, hit by waning smartphone sales and weaker Chinese demand. The South Korean firm, a key Apple Inc  supplier and the world's No.2 memory chipmaker by sales, also forecast lower capital spending for next year, as escalating Sino-U.S. trade tensions make it tough to predict demand. "Given global economic uncertainties and under the assumption that we will keep working on the inventories, we expect that investment will be adjusted to a lower level than this year," Myoung Young Lee, SK Hynix's executive vice president, told analysts. Lee did not elaborate on the size of its 2019 investment saying the company's business plans are not complete, but added that it would set up quarterly investment plans instead of an annual budget to better respond to demand uncertainty. Hynix, which spent around 10 trillion won ($8.8 billion) as capex in 2017, has planned to invest at least 30 percent more this year to boost output, hoping to ride on the coattails of the industry's two-year supercycle of tight supply and soaring prices. But some chip prices have already started falling and are set to end the unprecedented industry boom and soaring profits for chipmakers around the world, analysts say.  SK Hynix joined a growing list of chipmakers sounding caution on the industry outlook, as they wrestle with excess inventory due to weakening demand for smartphones, cryptocurrency mining devices and consumer electronics. Chipmakers including Texas Instruments Inc  and STMicroelectronics  offered disappointing forecasts this week, hammering tech sector shares and roiling global stock markets.  "Tough times are ahead until roughly the first half of next year, but we will have a clearer picture early next year when chipmakers lay out their investment plans," said Lee Wang-jin, analyst at Taurus Investment and Securities. Average prices of NAND flash memory chips, used in smartphones and memory cards to store data, are down sharply to levels seen in early 2016, and expected to continue to slide until the first quarter of 2019, SK Hynix said. It expected DRAM price increases would slow through the first quarter of next year and then remain flat or rebound afterwards. DRAM memory chips are used in servers, gaming PCs and cryptocurrency mining devices to process large amounts of data. SK Hynix said its July-September operating profit rose 73 percent to a record 6.5 trillion won, beating a 6.3 trillion won average forecast from 19 analysts, according to Refinitiv data. Sales rose 41 percent to a record high of 11.4 trillion won compared to the same period a year ago. ($1 = 1,137.6200 won) 
 
 On Sept. 12,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) announced a long-awaited trio of new iPhones.   Aimed squarely at the ultra-high-end portion of the smartphone   market were the iPhone XS and its larger counterpart, the iPhone   XS Max. These start at $999 and $1099, respectively, and are the   company's most advanced iPhones.Starting at a more accessible $749 price point is the iPhone   XR, which was announced alongside the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max   but won't hit store shelves until Oct. 26. The device shares many   core technologies with the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, such as   the   A12 Bionic chip    , the TrueDepth camera system (which enables features like Face   ID and Animoji), and the upgraded rear-facing wide angle   camera.  Image source: Apple.However, since the iPhone XR is designed to sell for less than   the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, the company needed to make some   trade-offs to keep the bill of materials low enough that Apple   could earn its desired gross margin. Those trade-offs include   using a liquid crystal display (LCD) instead of a pricier organic   light-emitting diode (OLED) screen, providing less system RAM,   omitting 3D Touch     and a telephoto lens, and using cheaper aluminum instead of   the stainless steel of the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max.Although it might be tempting simply to think of the   iPhone XR as the "cheap" iPhone option (and, technically, that's   true -- it's significantly cheaper than either the iPhone XS or   iPhone XS Max), I think there's another way that investors and   consumers alike might want to view the iPhone XR.When a company like Apple defines the features and   technologies it'll endow a product with, it needs to take into   account many factors, one of which is the company's desired   gross margin    profile as well as the price it hopes to sell the device for.   Apple's corporate average gross margin varies based on a number   of factors, but over the last five years, it's been between high   30%s and low 40%s, depending on the quarter:     AAPL Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly)    data by   YCharts Apple needs to deliver the kind of gross margin percentages   that investors expect (which are ultimately in service to the   kind of   net income    that investors want to see), but at the same time it needs to be   sure to deliver those gross margins while aspiring to keep   revenues moving in the right direction -- up.In theory, Apple could jack up the prices of its products a   lot and there would still likely be some takers, but I'd imagine   that there'd be far fewer of them, leading to a dramatic decline   in unit shipments and, quite likely, overall revenue and net   income.What all of this means is that every product Apple builds   needs to be the product of a smart set of trade-offs that make it   desirable and competitive while at the same time allowing Apple   to enjoy its desired gross margin percentage.With that in mind, I think of the iPhone XR as Apple's vision   of the best product it could deliver for $749, given the numerous   economic and technological constraints it's working under.When Apple introduced the iPhone X last year, the device was   significantly more advanced than either the iPhone 8 or iPhone 8   Plus -- and more expensive. The higher price tag allowed Apple to   deliver a product that included more expensive components and   features like an OLED screen, stainless steel casing, optical   image stabilization on both rear-facing cameras, and the   company's TrueDepth camera.And, as it turns out, many iPhone customers   were willing to pay extra for those features    .Now, not every iPhone buyer is willing or able to pay between   $999 and $1449 (the price of the iPhone XS Max with 512 gigabytes   of storage), but quite a few of them are. For those customers, it   makes sense for Apple to build products more expensive than   iPhones have historically been.Ultimately, one way to view Apple's lineup is not to see   the iPhone XR as the   cheap    model -- a smartphone that starts at $749 and goes up to $899 is   anything but cheap, as smartphones go -- but to see it as the   iPhone that Apple would've likely released had it not figured out   that many iPhone customers were willing to pay more for   higher-end models.  10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

 Shares of   Corning    (NYSE: GLW) initially dipped after the company's third quarter   earnings report release on Oct. 23, but subsequently rebounded   and finished the day with a 2% gain. The specialty materials   maker's revenue rose 15% annually to $3.01 billion, beating   estimates by $20 million and marking the company's second   straight quarter of double-digit growth. Its core revenue --   which excludes currency impacts, acquisitions, divestments, and   other charges -- rose 16%.On the bottom line, Corning's net income rose 60% annually to   $625 million, and its EPS jumped 72% to $0.67. On a core basis,   its earnings rose 28% annually to $0.51 per share, topping   expectations by three cents.  Image source: Corning.For the full year, Corning expects its revenue to rise 7% to   $11.3 billion, which is slightly higher than the consensus   estimate of $11.27 billion. Analysts expect its core EPS, which   was weighed down by   weaker growth    during the first half of 2018, to rise 2% for the full year.But next year analysts expect Corning's revenue and earnings   to rise 7% and 18%, respectively. Based on that forecast, Corning   trades at just 15 times forward earnings while paying a forward   dividend yield of 2.3%, making it seem like a cheap income play   for a volatile market. But before jumping in, investors should   review the key takeaways from its latest earnings report.In the first half of the year, Corning struggled with soft   sales of its Display Technologies products, which were throttled   by cyclically weak demand for LCD screens. A lack of major   smartphone launches also reduced demand for the unit's chemically   hardened Gorilla Glass, which supported its Specialty Materials   unit.However, Corning offset some of that weakness with strong   sales of Optical Communications products, which were buoyed by   its purchase of   3M    's (NYSE: MMM) optical unit, as well as robust sales of   particulate filters at its Environmental Technologies unit and   Valor Glass labware at its Life Sciences unit.During the second quarter, Corning stated that the headwinds   facing its Display and Specialty Materials units would fade   during the second half of 2018. The company's third quarter   numbers indicate that Corning is fulfilling that promise:UnitQ3 2018 RevenueQoQ growthYoY growth Optical Communications $1.12 billion9%22% Display Technologies $852 million9%7% Specialty Materials $459 million34%23% Environmental Technologies $331 million4%19% Life Sciences $231 million(6%)4%Source: Corning Q3 report.Corning attributed the positive growth of its Display   Technologies business to display glass price declines bottoming   out and improving during the quarter. It expects that trend to   continue throughout the fourth quarter and next year. It also   expects the market's volume to rise during that period as   suppliers try to meet the rising market demand for larger TV   screens.  Image source: Corning.It attributed the turnaround at Specialty Materials to a   "strong pull for glass innovations," which was supported by the   arrival of major new smartphones during the quarter.   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) , one of Corning's top Gorilla Glass customers,   notably introduced   three new versions    of the iPhone -- the iPhone XR, XS, and XS Max -- in September.   Strong sales of those iPhones, along with an upgraded version of   Gorilla Glass and new versions for wearables and cars, should   support the unit's continued growth.The only soft spot was the Life Sciences unit, which faced a   slight deceleration from previous quarters. However, Corning   stated that the smaller unit continued to "outpace overall market   growth."Looking ahead, Corning expects the Display and Optical   businesses to post low single-digit sequential growth during the   fourth quarter. It expects its Specialty Materials growth to   remain "consistent" with the prior year quarter, which saw the   unit's strongest growth in 2017, and for its Environmental and   Life Sciences unit to generate high single-digit sequential   growth.All of Corning's core businesses reported year-over-year   growth in net income, and all the units -- with the exception of   Life Sciences -- reported quarter-over-quarter growth as well.   Corning's core gross margin of 42% also represented a significant   improvement from the first half of 2018 and all of 2017. Its GAAP   gross margin came in at 41%.Those figures indicate that Corning isn't facing much   competition or pricing pressure in its core markets, despite   earlier concerns that softer demand for optical equipment or   competition from other makers of hardened glass would hurt its   margins.

FOCUS-Smartphones emerge as bright spot for Indian manufacturing
 By Sankalp Phartiyal NOIDA, IndiaOct 25 (Reuters) - Smartphone-maker Lava is a small player in India's booming mobile communications industry, but it has become a poster child for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitious effort to make India a global hub for electronics manufacturing. Just a few years ago, Lava imported cheap phones from China. Now it builds its own devices at two factories on the outskirts of New Delhi that employ about 3,500 people, and expansion plans are in the works. More than 120 new manufacturing units have created about 450,000 jobs in the mobile phone industry over the past four years, according to the Indian Cellular and Electronics Association, thanks largely to the 'Make In India' campaign and a phased plan featuring stiff duties on imported devices and parts. That growth has made India the world's second-biggest mobile phone maker and positioned it for further growth as trade tensions and rising costs hobble China's world-leading electronics manufacturing sector. "India has an opportunity to become a major player in the global supply chain because we have a very strong domestic economy," Vikas Agarwal, the India head of Chinese smartphone maker OnePlus, told Reuters. The country still needs to encourage the production of high-value components as well as research and development, Agarwal added, "but at least we are off to a very good start." The Indian industry's emergence is especially visible in Noida, where Lava is based. Once a suburb for tech outsourcing firms, Noida is now bursting with companies making everything from headphones and chargers to high-end smartphones. Sanjeev Agarwal, Lava's head of manufacturing, says local production is helping it reduce costs and build high-quality devices that can sell for less than $150. Much of the company's product design is still done in China, Agarwal said, but the company plans to bring that work to India over the next few years. The local presence allows quicker innovation, he said, as well as lower, tariff-free costs. Lava has some big neighbours in Noida. Samsung this year opened what it said was the world's biggest mobile phone plant there. The South Korean giant last year said it will spend 49.2 billion rupees ($672.45 million) to expand capacity at the plant over three years.  Not far from Samsung's factory, China's Oppo, one of India's top smartphone players, is building a massive plant too. It is expected to open soon. 
 ALTERNATIVE TO CHINA Modi's so-called phased manufacturing plan, introduced in 2016, aims to take advantage of India's huge domestic smartphone market to promote local production. India has more than a billion wireless subscribers, and about 380 million of them do not yet have a smartphone. The manufacturing plan includes import duties not only on phones, but also on accessories such as phone chargers, batteries and headphones, as well as components including pre-assembled printed circuit boards. Xiaomi, which competes with Samsung for the top spot in India's smartphone market, makes many of its phones using Foxconn's plants in southern India, with a total of six facilities producing its devices. Just as important, Xiaomi said this year that it wants its component suppliers to set up shop in India too, a move that could bring as much as $2.5 billion of investment and create as many as 50,000 jobs.  Xiaomi supplier Holitech Technology  has committed to investing about $200 million in India over three years in India, with plans to begin manufacturing in early 2019. It will make components such as camera and touch screen modules and fingerprint sensors, Muralikrishnan B, Xiaomi's chief operating officer for India, said in an email. The big prize for India, local industry officials say, is to become a full-fledged alternative to China as a manufacturing hub. More and more companies are realising they need a "China plus one strategy," one manufacturing industry source said. In China, "there is the Trump risk and there are other risks - currency risks, overall wage appreciation risk and so on," the source said, declining to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. "Today it's the trade-tariff war, tomorrow it may be something else, a natural disaster," the source added. "The question is then - how do I use India strategically?" Samsung has said it plans to use its Noida plant as an export hub, but it is unclear whether other manufacturers will follow suit. To become a true global centre for high-value mobile phone manufacturing, India still needs a more stable, business-friendly policy regime in a country known for heavy-handed regulation and abrupt shifts in industrial strategy, industry executives say. The country also needs better workforce training, said Tarun Pathak, associate director at tech researcher Counterpoint. "Import taxes kick-started local assembly, but now we need to look beyond just duties," Pathak said. Xiaomi's Muralikrishnan said bringing the entire electronics manufacturing ecosystem to India would be a big challenge. He added: "Building the expertise to manufacture high-end design flagships locally would also be a big step for the local industry." Apple, for example, assembles two low-cost models through Wistron  in the southern tech hub of Bengaluru. But with little domestic demand for its high-end phones, the company has resisted government pressure to move more of its work from China.

Wednesday Apple Rumors: Apple Registers New Macs in Eurasia
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLeading the Apple  (NASDAQ: AAPL ) rumor mill today is news of new Macs being registered. Today, we'll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Wednesday. New Macs : Apple is officially registering new Mac devices in Eurasia , reports MacRumors . Some of these registers are for devices simply updated with the newest operating system. However, four of the devices don't appear to have versions already in the wild.

15 Hot Stocks With Mass Teenager Appeal
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhen it comes to investing, especially in hot stocks, it is important to pay attention to consumer trends. After all, consumer trends dictate fundamentals, and fundamentals dictate stock prices. Ultimately, then, consumer trends dictate stock prices.Where do trends start? Normally, they start in younger demographics. Specifically, they start in the teenager demographic. Once the mass teenager demographic adopts a trend, that trend becomes huge and starts to influence the financials in a serious way. Once the financials get impacted, stocks move. Thus, the key to investing in hot stocks is identifying budding trends that teenagers are starting to adopt.What is the best way to do that? Take a look at Piper Jaffray's semi-annual Taking Stock With Teens Surveys . Twice a year, Piper Jaffray surveys thousands of teenagers across the United States about their favorite brands, services and platforms. The results are often quite profound, and have meaningful investment implications.Piper Jaffray just released Fall 2018 Survey results. What are the investment implications? Let's take a closer look.Teenagers still can't get enough of athletic apparel brand Nike (NYSE: NKE ). Nike remains the number one clothing and footwear brand among U.S. teens. That has been the case for several years now. Nike is also the number two shopping website among U.S. teens, something which has also been the case for several years.More importantly, the fashion trend seems to be flipping in favor of Nike. Over the past several years, while Nike has remained number one, its footwear mind-share has slipped while Adidas (OTCMKTS: ADDYY ) footwear mind-share has grown. But, that trend is on the cusp of reversing. In the Fall 2018 survey, Adidas footwear mind-share flattened out at 14%, while Nike footwear mind-share flattened out just above 40%.In other words, Nike remains the hottest clothing brand among teenagers, and should also benefit from the fashion trend moving in its favor over the next few quarters. This puts NKE stock, which currently trades at a reasonable valuation level and has big growth drivers, in a favorable position to climb higher for the foreseeable future.Linear TV is out. Internet TV is in. This trend is true everywhere, but it is most true for teenagers who have grown up in a world where on-demand streaming services are the norm. Among that trend-immersed cohort, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is the undisputed leader in the internet entertainment category.In the Fall 2018 survey, Netflix had 38% mind-share for daily video consumption. Back in the fall 2015 survey, Netflix also had 38% mind-share for daily video consumption. In other words, Netflix's mind-share has stabilized just shy of 40% over the past several years despite rising competitive threats from Hulu , AT&T (NYSE: T ), Disney (NYSE: DIS ) and others.That is a favorable trend for Netflix. And, it lines up perfectly with Netflix's numbers, which show that this company's growth trajectory isn't slowing down at all despite rising competition. Although the stock will have frequent bouts with valuation questions, so long as these long-term fundamentals continues to improve, NFLX stock should head higher.Sticking with the "internet TV is hot" theme, another winner in this category is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ). Indeed, one could argue that Alphabet, despite it's internet TV service YouTube having lower mind-share than Netflix, is the big winner in this space. Why? Mind-share expansion.Back in the Fall 2015 survey, YouTube had just 21% mind-share for daily video consumption. That grew to 26% in the Fall 2016 survey, and 29% in the Fall 2017 survey. In the Fall 2018 survey, it jumped all the way to 33%.In other words, YouTube has gained 12 points of mind-share over three years while Netflix has simply been stable. Thus, although the whole internet TV trend is growing, YouTube appears to be the fastest growing service in that space. This is undeniably a material positive for GOOG stock, which needs YouTube ad revenue growth to offset potential Google search revenue churn from Amazon competition.In the beauty category, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA ) was the clear winner in the Fall 2018 survey.In the Spring 2018 survey, Sephora dominated Ulta in terms of beauty destination mind-share. Sephora registered 44% mind-share. Ulta came in with just 28% mind-share. But, the Fall 2018 survey painted a completely different picture. Sephora's mind-share dropped to 34%, while Ulta's mind-share rose to 34%. In other words, in just a few months, Ulta managed to steal a ton of mind-share from Sephora.How? The big catalyst here is likely celebrity Kylie Jenner, who is debuting her cosmetics line at Ulta stores this holiday season. Hype regarding this roll-out likely improved Ulta's visibility and relevance, and improved traffic trends even ahead of the launch. These gains should continue post-launch, and perhaps with even more momentum. Thus, ULTA stock looks positioned to ride Kylie-related tailwinds to more gains in the future.Although the smartphone market globally may be reaching saturation, that doesn't mean Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is done growing its iPhone install base. Instead, Piper Jaffray survey results indicate that Apple is currently growing and will to continue to grow smartphone market share over the next several years.In the Fall 2018 survey, intent to buy an iPhone hit a new high at 86%. This continues what has been a multiyear uptrend in iPhone buying intentions among U.S. teenagers. So long as this trend persists, Apple has room to grow its iPhone install base through market share expansion.iPhone buying intentions are rising alongside higher iPhone prices. Thus, $1,000-plus prices aren't scaring away trend-oriented consumers, and that means that in the long run, Apple also has a tremendous opportunity to grow iPhone revenue through consistently higher ASPs. In the big picture, continued strong iPhone growth on top of recently red-hot Services growth should continue to power AAPL stock higher.VF Corporation (NYSE: VFC ) finds itself on this list because the company owns the Vans brand, and Vans have been one of the hottest trends among U.S. teenagers for several quarters now.In the Fall 2018 survey, Vans hit an all-time high in mind-share - led by females, where Vans came in as the number one footwear brand for upper-income females. Increasing brand relevance for Vans is nothing new. This has been a powerful multiyear trend. In the Spring 2017 survey, Vans had footwear mind-share of just 9%. That rose to 12% in the Fall 2017 survey, 16% in the Spring 2018 survey, and 19% in the most recent Fall 2018 survey.In other words, Vans has been and remains one of the hottest trends as streetwear styles have made a comeback. This positions VFC stock, which is currently quite cheap at just 19X forward earnings, to remain a near to medium term winner.It is no secret that the main Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) app continues to lose relevance among teenagers. In the Fall 2018 survey, only 5% of teens listed Facebook as their favorite social media app, versus 8% in the Spring 2018 survey and 23% way back in 2014.But Facebook-owned Instagram? It's the hottest trend in social media and just overtook Snapchat (NYSE: SNAP ) in terms of usage. While more teens list Snapchat as their favorite app than Instagram, Snapchat's mind-share has plateaued just shy of 50% for several quarters now. Meanwhile, Instagram's mind-share has risen from the lower 20's to the lower 30's.Also, more teens now use Instagram on a monthly basis than do Snapchat, according to Fall 2018 results.In the big picture, then, Facebook is keeping users in its ecosystem. The kids may be leaving Facebook, but they are as addicted as ever to Instagram. That means Facebook will still be able to monetize those users, giving Facebook stock a ton of firepower for long-term revenue and profit growth.Teenagers are finally eating at Chipotle (NYSE: CMG ) again, and that is a good sign for Chipotle's long overdue recovery.Before all of Chipotle's health issues went mainstream, it was consistently a top-3 restaurant in Piper Jaffray's surveys with mid-teens mind-share. That all changed after the health issues became well known. Chipotle's mind-share dropped to 7% among upper-income teens and below 4% for average-income teens in the Spring 2018 survey.The Fall 2018 survey suggests that a turnaround is underway. Chipotle's mind-share among upper-income teens rose to 8%, and among average-income teens, it rose to 4%. Those mind-share gains made Chipotle a top 5 restaurant destination among both average and upper-income teens in the Fall 2018 survey for the first time since Spring 2017. If this brand resurgence persists, CMG stock could continue to rally.While Chipotle has struggled with brand relevance in the restaurant category over the past several years, McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ) has flourished thanks to a revamped marketing strategy and expanded menu.Back in the Spring 2015 survey, McDonald's wasn't a top-5 restaurant and had lower than 3% mind-share. But, the company started showing signs of life in the 2017 surveys, and is now building on that success. In the Fall 2018 survey, McDonald's was a top restaurant among both upper-income and average-incomes teens, with 4%-plus market share for both cohorts.Clearly, the McDonald's revamp has worked, and teens are starting to dine there with more frequency than they have in recent memory. If McDonald's can continue to innovate its menu to spark renewed brand relevance, then MCD stock should continue to be a winner.Fashion designer brand Michael Kors (NYSE: KORS ) remains the handbag leader among U.S. teenagers, and that positions this company for stabilized success over the next several years.In the Fall 2015 survey, Michael Kors had 31% mind-share in the handbag category. Michael Kors had 30% mind-share in the handbag category in the Fall 2018 survey. In other words, in the usually highly cyclical handbag industry, Michael Kors has maintained leadership position and stabilized mind-share around 30% for three years.That is a testament to this company's staying power in the handbag category. So long as Michael Kors remains the handbag leader, KORS stock should perform well - pending broad consumer and economic strength. Just like internet TV, e-commerce remains one of the biggest trends in the consumer-facing world. This is especially true for teenagers, who have grown up in a world where digital shopping is the norm. Among that trend-oriented cohort, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is the runaway e-commerce leader.Back in the Fall 2015 survey, Amazon registered 38% mind-share as the top shopping website. That mind-share has steadily grown ever since, and is now hovering around 50%. With the exceptions of Apple and iPhone buying intentions, Amazon's 50% mind-share in digital shopping is unparalleled across the Piper Jaffray surveys.Amazon is currently on trajectory to have as much influence and reach in the digital shopping world as Apple has in the smartphone community. So long as Amazon remains on that trajectory, AMZN stock will continue to be a big winner.The Fall 2018 survey had some new entrants. Notably, Foot Locker (NYSE: FL ) cracked the top-5 footwear brands list for the first time in recent memory. Granted, it was only 3% share, but it is still notable that Foot Locker wiggled its way into the top 5.A lot of this could be due to Nike's rising relevance. Foot Locker and Nike have a deep connection. Indeed, most of what Foot Locker sells is premium Nike product. Thus, as Nike's brand relevance rises, Foot Locker's brand relevance rises, too.The same should be true for the stock prices. But, NKE stock has already taken off to all-time highs, while FL stock remains well off peak levels. If Foot Locker can maintain a strong connection with Nike, then FL stock should inevitably follow in NKE's footsteps and roar higher.One of the biggest findings from the Fall 2018 survey is that video games are red hot. As a percent of the male wallet, video game spend hit a new survey peak. Digital downloads also hit a new peak. This finding is favorable for all video game publishers. But, it is especially favorable for Activision (NASDAQ: ATVI ).Activision's latest and greatest game,  Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 , has been a smashing hit. It broke sales and engagement records, and everyone seems to love it. Considering the backdrop for video games is exceptionally favorable right now, it looks increasingly likely that Activision is making a ton of money off of  Black Ops 4 .This is all great news for ATVI stock. The stock has been punished in the recent tech sell-off, but the fundamentals remain exceedingly favorable. As such, this stock could be due for a nice end-of-year bounce. The other video game stock that is an especially big winner as a result of peak video game mind-share this holiday season is Take-Two (NASDAQ: TTWO ).For all intents and purposes, the whole Take-Two narrative has been building to this holiday season.  Red Dead Redemption 2 launches in late October, and this game is expected to break all sorts of records. TTWO stock has been rallying into this catalyst. That means that expectations are high, and that this could easily become a "sell the news" event.But, launching this highly anticipated game at a time when video game mind-share just hit a new peak is a recipe for success, not disaster. As such, it looks likely that  Red Dead Redemption 2 impresses. If it does, then TTWO stock should end the year on a high note.Among the U.S. teenager demographic, Chipotle is making a comeback and McDonald's has been on a nice uptrend. But, the one fast casual chain that has been steady through it all is Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ).In the Fall 2018 survey, Starbucks was the only publicly traded restaurant chain with double-digit mind-share. This is nothing new for Starbucks. The coffee chain has consistently maintained 10%-12% mind-share for several years now, and there hasn't been much fluctuation in the numbers.In other words, despite rising competition from McDonald's and indie coffee shops, Starbucks' popularity among U.S. teenagers hasn't wavered by much. That means that while growth may be slower going forward, Starbucks have long-term staying power in the coffee game. This long-term staying power will inevitably drive long-term gains for SBUX stock.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long NKE, NFLX, T, DIS, GOOG, ULTA, AAPL, FB, MCD, AMZN, FL, and ATVI. The post 15 Hot Stocks With Mass Teenager Appeal appeared first on InvestorPlace .
Why Google Is Willing to Pay Apple $12 Billion Per Year
  Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) receives a lot of money from Google just for   making it the default search engine in Safari on iOS and macOS   devices. Last year, the   Alphabet    (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) company reportedly paid Apple   $3 billion    for the preferential placement. That number may have tripled this   year, according to analyst Rod Hall as reported by    Business Insider      (link behind paywall). Hall says that number will rise to   $12 billion next year.Apple has listed licensing revenue from deals like the one it   has with Google as the first source driving growth of Apple's   services revenue in its quarterly filings with the SEC this year.   That's a change from last year, when it listed the App Store   first. That change suggests licensing revenue is growing   extremely quickly for Apple.However, investors should always ask why. Why is Google   willing to pay billions of dollars to Apple to ensure its place   in Safari?  Image source: Apple.Apple has a 44% market share of U.S. smartphones and about a   12% share of PCs. But Apple users outpunch their weight when it   comes to how much they use Google and click on search ads. Of all   Google search ad clicks in the third quarter, 49% came from iOS   and macOS devices, according to data from   Merkle    .And that share may continue to rise as mobile grows and   desktop searches decline in importance. Alphabet notes the   biggest contributor to its revenue growth is mobile search, in   each of its quarterly earnings reports and conference calls with   analysts. Merkle's data corroborates that statement, as it notes   U.S. spending on phone Google search ads increased 33% year over   year in the third quarter compared to just 11% on desktop.Furthermore, Apple users represent historically higher value   than Android users.   Spending in the App Store    was nearly that of Google Play spending worldwide in the first   half of 2018, according to data from   Sensor Tower    . That's despite Android's massive install base compared to iOS.   Apple's premium product attracts consumers with money to   spend.So, not only do Apple users produce about half of Google's ad   clicks in the U.S., those clicks are more valuable to advertisers   than clicks on less-expensive Android devices. That means   advertisers are willing to pay more per click.In the latest iOS update, Apple included   Intelligent Tracking Prevention    . Intelligent Tracking Prevention is a system that makes it   harder for third-party websites to track your history across the   web. Instead of keeping cookies for the standard 30 days, Apple   limits the use of cookies in most cases to just 24 hours unless   the user comes back to the site again.That sounds like a bad thing for companies like Google, which   rely on collecting as much data on its users as possible. Merkle   points out the share of Google search ad clicks from using   data-centric audience targeting like Customer Match, similar   audiences, and remarketing lists dropped at the end of the third   quarter. That coincides with the release of iOS 12 in   mid-September.But the limitations Apple put in place may actually end up   being beneficial for highly trafficked sites like Google.com,   since it puts less-trafficked sites at a significant disadvantage   in the targeting data they can use. If a user visits Google.com   every day, Google won't see much impact in its ability to target   ads on iOS devices. In fact, Apple just created an even greater   incentive for Google to pay up for the default search engine   spot, so users keep coming back to Google.com over and over   again.As Apple continues to provide a high number of quality leads   to Google's search engine and makes it more difficult to track   user behavior on its devices, Apple should be able to keep   milking Google for billions in high-margin revenue every   year.  10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (C     shares)       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp CTSH  is set to report third-quarter 2018 results on Oct 30. The company's earnings have beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 4.62%.    Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation Price and     EPS Surprise      Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation Price   and EPS Surprise    |      Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation Quote The company's strategic customer base (clients with the potential to generate $5-$50 million or more in annual revenues) continues to expand. Cognizant now has more than 371 strategic clients.    Acquisitions such as the Adaptra, TriZetto, Bolder Healthcare, Mirabeau BV, and the technology and business process services unit of Frontica Business Solutions AS are benefiting the company. Cognizant has not only gained new customers from these buyouts but also expanded its digital delivery capabilities.    Notably, acquisitions like Netcentric and Mirabeau strengthened Cognizant's digital leadership in Europe. Outsourcing growth benefited from the acquisition of Bolder Healthcare.    The acquisition of Advanced Technology Group (ATG), which has deep Quote-to-Cash (Q2C) domain expertise and offers extensive Salesforce based CPQ and Billing solutions, strengthens Cognizant's cloud solutions portfolio.    Moreover, the acquisition of privately-held consulting firm, SaaSfocus expands Cognizant's end-to-end digital transformation services in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, particularly Australia and India. Notably, SaaSfocus is one of the largest independent Salesforce Platinum consulting partners in this fast growing region.    However, the company faces significant geographic, domain and customer concentration risks. Further, lackluster spending by large banks in the financial services sector and stiff competition in the IT services market are concerns.   What Our Model Says    According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP  . The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.    Cognizant has a Zacks Rank #3 but its Earnings ESP is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  .   Stocks to Consider    Here are some companies, which, per our model, have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:    Himax Technologies, Inc. HIMX  has an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   .    HubSpot, Inc. HUBS  has an Earnings ESP of +57.58% and a Zacks Rank #2.    Apple AAPL  has an Earnings ESP of +1.06% and a Zacks Rank #2. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric   Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.

Microsoft Stock Is the Cheapest and the Best Among the Cloud Czars
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) will report earnings after the market closes Oct. 24 as the most stable, and among the cheapest, of the five Cloud Czars that now dominate the world economy. So what should Microsoft stock investors expect?CEO Satya Nadella has used heavy investment in cloud data centers to transform the former maker of PC software and applications into a default vehicle for delivery of cloud applications. This is something he's accomplished in less than five years and a core reason behind the renewed interest in MSFT stock.For the quarter, Microsoft is expected to deliver 96 cents per share of earnings - about $7.5 billion - and there are hopes for $1 per share, on revenue of $27.86 billion. That's more revenue, and more than twice the earnings, of mighty Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ), which is expected to report a day later.Microsoft, which five years ago was headed toward irrelevance under former CEO Steve Ballmer, is now hot on the trail of Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) $1 trillion in market cap. Since Nadella was announced as CEO in February 2014, Microsoft's market cap is up nearly 200%.Despite this, I would argue that Microsoft stock is still cheap. Its price-to-earnings ratio is listed as over 50 because it chose to defer earnings and take charges before the Trump Administration's tax cut took effect, reporting a $6.3 billion loss in last year's December quarter.At its 2018 pace of earnings, Microsoft should have a P/E ratio of just 26 by the end of the year, for a company growing at over 15% per year, with a bottom line growing by $1 billion per quarter, plus a 42 cent per share dividend that was at just 28 cents when Nadella became CEO.The power behind Microsoft stock today is no longer built on Windows or Office but its Azure cloud - a global network of data centers that has become a default platform for many corporate and consumer applications. Azure has also helped Microsoft become a hardware powerhouse, its Surface PC is now approaching the sales pace of the Apple MacBook , and its Xbox game machine in a strong second place behind the Sony (NYSE: SNE ) PlayStation.While Alphabet and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) depend on advertising to support their clouds, Microsoft has gone up the stack to software services. It has even made peace with open source, joining the Open Invention Network , promising not to enforce its patents against Linux and other open source projects. Microsoft has also won approval to buy Github , the largest repository for open source projects, a move that would have been unthinkable early in the decade.Nadella's most controversial move was spending $26.2 billion on LinkedIn, the professional social network, but its use for building careers and businesses now make it a boost , not a drain, on results and Nadella is tying his own pay to the unit's performance.Even Bing, the search engine launched in 2009 to general laughter, is showing signs of life, its market share against Google having grown 50% under Nadella, to 24% . That, and its integration with other sites like LinkedIn, gave it 27% of search engine ad revenue in the June quarter.Microsoft made a lot of mistakes in the early years of the internet, and was late to the cloud, but it has made up for lost time, and MSFT stock has been thrust back into the minds of investors.Microsoft's Azure revenues are secure because software customers are making money off their deployments, and enterprises are cutting costs with them. Co-founder Bill Gates, who was said to be rescuing the company when he returned to part-time work under Nadella in 2014, is still spending a third of his time there , but in the background, working with engineers and technical strategists.I've also returned, as a Microsoft stock owner, and couldn't be happier about it.Dana Blankenhorn  is a financial and technology journalist.

Amazon.com AMZN and microchip giant Qualcomm Inc. QCOM are joining to bring more Alexa-powered wireless headphones, the companies announced earlier this week.Qualcomm   will unravel the industry's first Alexa-enabled bluetooth smart headset reference design that can be used by manufacturers to effectively embed Alexa in the device. When the wireless headset is paired with an Android phone, Alexa can be activated through the Alexa app.Amazon's initiative to broaden the reach of its voice assistant isn't new in the industry. Apple's AAPL virtual assistant Siri can already be found assisting users through the company's wireless earbuds AirPods.The recent trend in the industry initiated by Apple brings a couple of related stocks in focus. These companies are hurrying to partner with headset makers to integrate their AI assistants for user convenience.Need for Superior Audio Quality Driving DemandThe new Alexa-enabled wireless headset feature will enable users to avail Alexa on-the-go without needing to communicate with their phone. The feature is helpful for customers, who use voice-enabled services but seek better audio quality.The requirement for enhanced sound quality coupled with demand for the availability of a virtual assistant on any device is pushing the industry to ensure the right smart products that come with an AI-enabled voice assistant. Headphones are at the center of this demand because these offer customers accessibility to their virtual assistant anywhere, anytime.Amazon and Alphabet are already competing to conquer the smart home space with voice-enabled smart household products that could run the house with a single command. The implementation of better-quality, voice assistant-enabled wireless headphones will make managing the smart devices even smoother and more efficient.Bose and Jabra headsets already feature built-in Alexa, while Sony's headsets will accommodate the voice assistant following a software update, according to a Reuters report. But now other wireless headset manufacturers can use Qualcomm's reference design to make room for Alexa.The partnership with Amazon could be Qualcomm's move to diversify its products away from modem chips and processors. As more customers hunt for enhanced audio-quality headsets, more headset manufacturers are bound to adopt AI-enabled assistants in smart devices.How Robust Could the Wireless Headset Market Be?According to a report by techsciresearch released in April, the global wireless headset market is set to witness strong growth - a compound annual growth rate of over 15% - in the next five years. The segment was valued at $7.65 billion in 2017 and the increasingly advanced technological features in the headsets are pushing the market to expand further.Some of the key players in the wireless headsets markets include Motorola MSI and Sony SNE .You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

 By Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Apple  Chief Executive Tim Cook on Wednesday said customer data was being "weaponised with military efficiency" by companies to increase profit and called for a federal privacy law in the United States. But Facebook  CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended his company's ad-based business model said users were aware of a trade-off for free services. Apple, which designs many of its products so that it cannot see users' data, has largely avoided the data privacy scandals that have enmeshed its rivals Google  and Facebook this year. "The desire to put profits over privacy is nothing new," Cook told a packed audience of privacy regulators, corporate executives and other participants. Issues over how data is used and how consumers can protect their personal information are under the spotlight after big breaches of data privacy involving millions of internet and social media users in Europe and the United States. Cook in his speech cited former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis who in a Harvard Law Review article in 1890 warned that gossip was no longer the resource of the idle and the vicious but had become a trade. "Today that trade has exploded into a data industrial complex. Our own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponised against us with military efficiency," Cook said. "These scraps of data ... each one harmless enough on its own ... are carefully assembled, synthesised, traded, and sold," Cook said. "We shouldn't sugarcoat the consequences. This is surveillance. And these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich the companies that collect them," he said. 
 FACEBOOK'S AD-BASED MODEL Zuckerberg, speaking via video message, said Facebook users were aware of the trade-off between a free service and advertisements. "Instead of charging people, we charge advertisers to show ads. People consistently tell us that they want a free service and that if they going to see ads to get it, then they want those ads to be relevant," he said. Facebook was investing heavily in both security and privacy even as this impacts on its profitability, Zuckerberg said. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai welcomed the global focus on privacy, saying that the company was doing its part by taking measures to allow users more control over their data. "User trust is the foundation for everything we do, and privacy and security are fundamental tenets of that," he said by video message. "We've been working for years to provide more transparency and control for our users, and we appreciate the input and partnership from data protection authorities." Cook also warned about governments abusing users' data and their trust, a concern for many with elections coming up in several countries. "Rogue actors and even governments have taken advantage of user trust to deepen divisions, incite violence, and even undermine our shared sense of what is true and what is false." Cook said Apple fully backed a federal privacy law in the United States, something Europe has already introduced via its General Data Protection Regulation. "Users should always know what data is being collected and what it is being collected for," he said. "This is the only way to empower users to decide what collection is legitimate and what isn't. Anything less is a sham." 
 
 ROME, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Italy's anti-trust watchdog said on Wednesday it was fining Apple Inc.  and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd5 million euros ($5.7 million) each following complaints they used software updates to slow down their mobile phones. Apple was hit with an additional 5 million euro fine for failing to give clients clear information about how to maintain or eventually replace handset batteries. Italian consumer groups had complained that software updates for mobile phones reduced the functionality of the devices and were designed to push clients into buying new handsets. It added the two firms had not provided clients adequate information about the impact of the new software "or any means of restoring the original functionality of the products". Apple acknowledged last year that iPhone software had the effect of slowing down some phones with battery problems, but denied it had ever done anything to intentionally shorten the life of a product.  The firm apologised for its actions and cut battery replacement costs. It has also said it would change its software to show users whether their phone batteries were working well. Samsung's software updates for its phones have not previously been questioned. ($1 = 0.8760 euros) 
 
STMicro upholds bullish 2018 growth target on strong automotive, imaging sales
 Earlier this year, Bloomberg   reported    that   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) , which has a   strong internal chip development organization    , "is planning to use its own chips in Mac computers beginning as   early as 2020, replacing processors from   Intel    (NASDAQ: INTC) Corp."That story led to a meaningful drop in Intel's shares.Last week, Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst with TF International   Securities, published a research note (reported by   MacRumors    ) in which he lays out his expectation that Apple will, in fact,   swap Intel chips out for its own processors in the Mac "starting   [in] 2020 or 2021."Let's take a closer look at his reasoning.  Image source: Intel.The first reason he gives is that "Apple could control   everything about the Mac's design and production and be rid of   the negative impacts from Intel's processor shipment schedule   changes."Next, Kuo claims that Apple moving to an in-house design would   lead to "better profits thanks to lower processor cost." The idea   here is that while building its own processors would require   significant up-front development costs (though hypothetical Mac   processors would likely leverage much of the technology that's   already been developed for iPhone and iPad chips), the cost of   goods sold per chip to Apple would be lower.The third point that Kuo makes is that Apple could enjoy "Mac   market share gain if Apple lowers the price." In this case,   though, instead of pocketing the bill of materials cost savings   that Apple would enjoy from lower processor unit costs, it'd use   those to reduce Mac prices, which Kuo thinks could spur increased   demand for the Mac. (Although, in this case, Apple would be   sacrificing the potential per-unit profit increases that Kuo   mentioned in the last point.)And, finally, Kuo says that moving to an in-house chip design   "could differentiate Mac from peers' products." Now, simply being   different    isn't valuable in itself -- Macs with Apple's in-house chips   would need to enable capabilities and experiences that wouldn't   be possible with Intel chips.Keep in mind that Apple sells a fairly broad range of Macs,   from its slim MacBook all the way to the Mac Pro desktop product   line. Neither Bloomberg's report in April nor Kuo's more recent   note indicated which of the Mac product lines would be moved over   to Apple-designed chips first or if they expect Apple to migrate   its entire Mac portfolio to in-house chips in one shot.Nevertheless, were Apple to do this migration, Intel's revenue   and profits would clearly take a hit while the company that   manufactured the chips on Apple's behalf would benefit.According to Kuo, that beneficiary will be   Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company    (NYSE: TSM) . TSMC is currently the sole manufacturer of the   chips that power Apple's current iPhone and iPad portfolios, and   Kuo expects that Apple will tap TSMC to build the   applications processors that power the 2019 and 2020 iPhones.   It'd be a surprise if TSMC   weren't    the manufacturer of any potential Apple-designed Mac   processors.  10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Advertising, Other Bets, & More Important Q3 Google Estimates
 Shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL  have slipped over 11% during the last three months. But things could turn around for the search engine and advertising giant when it reports its Q3 financial results Thursday. So, let's see what to expect from Alphabet's top and bottom lines and some of its key business units. Overview Google is coming off a quarter that saw its total revenues surge 26% to reach $32.65 billion.The firm also claims approximately 37% of the total U.S. digital advertising market, according to eMarketer. This crushes second place Facebook's FB  20%.Investors should also note that Google recently launched its next-generation Pixel 3 and the Pixel 3XL smartphones that hope to better compete against Apple's AAPL  latest iPhones. The tech powerhouse also rolled out its new Google Home Hub to fight Amazon AMZN  and others in the crowded home assistant market. These, however, won't impact the firm's Q3 results.    Our current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Google's Q3 revenues to jump by roughly 22.4% to reach $27.25 billion. Investors should note that our revenue estimate excludes Google Network Members revenues, which hit $4.825 billion in Q2. Meanwhile, Alphabet's adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to pop by 10.1% to hit $10.54 per share.Yet, these top and bottom line estimates might impact GOOGL stock less, especially in the near term, than its individual business segment performance. Luckily, we can turn to our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file to help prepare for this.The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non-financial metrics reported by companies. The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts. Google Advertising Revenues Google is still an advertising business at its core that makes a majority of its money from its search-related business. Last quarter, the firm's advertising revenues surged roughly 24% from $22.672 billion to reach $28.087 billion.Looking ahead, Google's main ad unit its expected to see its Q3 revenues reach $29.140 billion, based on our NFM estimates. This would mark just over a 21% climb from the year-ago period when the firm posted ad revenues of $24.065 billion. Google Other Revenues Moving on, Alphabet's "Google other revenues" is made up of the Google Play Store, Google's Cloud offerings, and its hardware business. Other revenues jumped by $1.184 billion, or over 36% to touch $4.425 billion during the second quarter.Google other revenues, which includes its Pixel products, are projected to jump nearly 41% from $3.405 billion in the year-ago period to reach $4.796 billion in Q3. Other Bets Lastly, we need to know what to expect from Alphabet's Other Bets unit. This business segment jumped roughly 50% from $97 million in the second quarter of 2017 to hit $145 million. The growth was primarily driven by Fiber and Verily.Other bets, which also features Google's self-driving car segment Waymo, is expected to see its revenues hit $156.78 million in Q3. Investors should note that Google removed its Nest smart-home business from its other bets unit earlier this year.Make sure to check back here for our full analysis of Alphabet's actual results after the closing bell on Thursday.

 By Heekyong Yang SEOUL, Oct 24 (Reuters) - South Korea'sLG Display Co Ltd  posted a 76 percent fall in third-quarter profit on Wednesday compared with a year earlier, after two quarters of consecutive losses, helped by higher seasonal panel prices. The Apple Inc  supplier said operating profit was 140 billion won ($123.2 million) for the July-September quarter, beating an average forecast of 79 billion won from 10 analysts, according to a Refinitiv poll. Revenue fell 12 percent from a year earlier to 6.1 trillion won. The Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED) TV panel business turned to profit in the third quarter, supported by sales volume growth. The firm did not disclose the size of the profit. Eo Kyu-jin, an analyst at eBest Securities, said its costly OLED business was not doing enough to shore up profit, and prices of some panels had already begun to fall. "Demand will go down again after the holiday season in the fourth quarter is over," Eo said.

5 Top Stock Trades for Wednesday: Tesla, Boeing, AT&T Earnings Preview
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsStocks were hammered off the open, with the S&P 500 and Dow JonesIndustrial Average gapping below the 200-day moving average and taking out their lows from earlier this month. The Russell 2000 also took out its monthly lows. That's left a lot of top stock trades for us to dissect, particularly as we enter the thick of earnings seasons.Just a day after we broke down how to tradeTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) over the next few weeks, the company announced that it will release its earnings far earlier than expected.Now the automaker will join Ford (NYSE: F ) in reporting on Wednesday after the close . That's coupled with news that Citron Research, run by the notorious short-seller Andrew Left, is taking a long position in Tesla.Despite the markets taking another beating, shares of Tesla have been rallying all day. Shares are now up 10% to $290 ahead of tomorrow's report . So what now?Production remains strong, while the company likely turned positive free cash flow and generated a profit in Q3. If confirmed that that's the case, we could get a rally over $300. The question will then become, can Tesla rally and close above the $300 to $310 range. If so, we could get a rally into the mid-$300s.Should TSLA selloff on earnings, look to see if the recent range lows near $250 hold.Boeing (NYSE: BA ) is also set to report earnings , with its quarterly results due up on Wednesday before the open.Like most stocks, BA has been experiencing some turbulence. The question is, will a strong earnings report pull in investors looking for some safety? We've seen that action in names like Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG ), as well as dividend-dependable companies like REITs and AT&T (NYSE: T ) - more on the latter in a moment.Given the nature of the market right now, it's not surprising to see BA's strong bounce off support. Particularly given that it comes off the 200-day moving average and at a confluence of trendlines.I actually would feel comfortable owning BA into earnings, with upside to $370 and downside likely limited to roughly $340. On a pullback, look to see if this lower level holds, and on a rally look to see if BA can break through $370.Looking to follow the solid earnings results ofVerizon (NYSE: VZ ), AT&T will also report earnings Wednesday morning. Now above all three major moving averages and with an attractive 6.1% dividend yield, I wouldn't be surprised to see AT&T bid up on its results.The real hurdle will come at $33.85-ish though. A close above this can spark a larger rally in T stock. On a decline, see how ~$32 holds up. Keep it simple.3M Co (NYSE: MMM ) fell after reporting earnings , but is bouncing from its sub-$190 lows. $190 is a key level and has been for some time.Like AT&T, I want to keep it very simple with MMM, particularly in this environment. Conservative investors can bail on MMM on a close below $190. Aggressive traders can use Tuesday's low as their stop-loss. On a close above $195, a retest of the 200-day moving average is possible.For as weak as the markets have been, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) never really wavered. Shares have held this $215-ish area as support and did so again Tuesday, even amid the intense selling pressure.Once stocks began bouncing on Tuesday, it led the indices higher as well. Bears will have trouble making much headway so long as Apple holds up over $215. It's a significant player with a $1 trillion market cap, both in the market and in investor psychology.In the same sense, a break below $215 likely spells trouble for the stock market. Although a pullback into the $205 to $208 area will likely be gobbled up by the bulls. Just barely over the 50-day is a good development and in an ordinary tape, I would call Apple a buy, buy, buy!Conservative buyers may wait for a possible pullback, or at least let Apple setup for another day. Aggressive bulls are already long over the 50-day.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell .

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEven though markets keep trying to scare investors out of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), the cash-generating smartphone giant is a stock that investors should just buy, hold, and forget forever. The reason is simple: AAPL, whose market cap crossed $1 trillion recently, keeps growing at an impressive pace. Yet if markets correct and investors look for excuses to sell stocks, Apple will prevail because of its strength in multiple markets.Moreover, AAPL has multiple, positive catalysts that will keep its businesses strongApple refreshed its new iPhones, most notably the XS and XS Max, with several features  Additionally, AAPL cut the prices of the iPhone 7 and 8, and it discontinued the SE. Though this is the "S," or intermediate upgrade phase of the device, the refresh should help the company sustain its profit margins. The price may deter consumers from upgrading because the new iPhones cost $1,379.00-$1,999.00 in the U.S. But payment installments and subsidies from AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T ) and  Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ ) should help make the devices more affordable. The XR starts at $749.One important side note is that on the Verizon Wireless page, the average rating of the XS model is just 3.5 stars. The device earned high ratings for battery life and design, but it received a low score on storage. That may deter some consumers from upgrading to the device. But for investors, complaints about low storage are  good . Consumers will have to pay more in order to obtain additional storage, boosting Apple's profits and AAPL stock in the process.AAPL said that it would have an event on October 30 . Chances are good that it will introduce updates to the iPad, MacBook, and Mac Mini during the event. In the last few years, Apple appears to have neglected these product lines by only updating them sporadically. During the upcoming event, AAPL may finally bring higher-end specifications to the Mac Mini and call it a Mac Mini Pro.At a recent price of around $220, AAPL stock trades at a valuation of 19 times earnings. Apple stock is trading for 16 times analysts' consensus 2018 earnings per share estimate. And while the dividend of AAPL stock yields only 1.33%, patient investors may continue holding the stock and buy call options against the underlying holding.Per tipranks , the 36 analysts who cover Apple stock have an average price target of $241.33, suggesting upside of around 9%. So if Apple stock drops in the near-term, investors should hold onto the shares.When AAPL reports its quarterly results on November 1, the company will probably report strong profits from nearly all parts of its business, including Music and Cloud. Last quarter, Apple earned $2.34 per share as its revenue rose 17.4% to $53.3 billion. iPhone sales jumped 20%, helped by the upgrades of existing customers, along with more consumers switching to an Apple device for the first time.Double-digit percentage growth in Apple's active installed base helped AAPL generate record service revenue of $9.5 billion. Apple's revenue probably reached record levels again last quarter, since the number of consumers using its products increased.The only short-term risk that may hurt AAPL stock is Apple's outlook. The company's guidance may be negatively impacted by the U.S.-China trade war. If the conflict has a material impact on consumers in China, iPhone sales could be negatively affected.The Chinese government may even go out of its way to encourage its citizens to buy smartphones made by Chinese companies, hurting iPhone sales in the future.In the last decade, as Apple stock rose, there was no trade war affecting Apple's results. As early as this quarter, AAPL and owners of AAPL stock might find out the impact, if any, of a trade war on the company's results.As of this writing, the author did not hold stock in any of the companies mentioned. The post Why Apple Is Still a Buy And Hold And Forget Forever Stock appeared first on InvestorPlace .
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's here. We're now entering the thick of earnings season, with more companies scheduled to report their numbers this week than any other week of the quarter. And an already-volatile time of year is made even more volatile this time around as investors start to wonder if the recent earnings growth pace can be sustained. Even the bluest of the blue-chip stocks aren't immune price jolts, if the right headlines catch investors' attention in the right way.Not all volatility has to be bad volatility, however. Sometimes, earnings news can push a stock firmly higher without any warning.To that end, here's a run-down of the top 10 blue-chip stocks to buy for investors willing to take a bit of a gamble on an earnings-driven pop.Obviously there are never any guarantees, but in all 10 cases there's either a history or a special situation (if not both) that suggests an earnings bump may be in the cards.Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ) isn't a cheap stock by anybody's standards. Even on a forward-looking basis, the forward P/E of 52 is tough to swallow.This is a name, however, where the valuation just hasn't mattered. It has been all about the growth story and its reliability. The top line is projected to grow more than 25% this year, and more than 20% next year, with even faster earnings growth in the cards. And, Salesforce.com hasn't failed to beat a quarterly earnings estimate in years .In that light, Bret Kenwell was right on Monday when he explained the 13% pullback that CRM stock has made since its record high from four weeks ago (the biggest correction ithas suffered in years) is a gift to investors who've been biding their time.It's almost a little bit cliche to name the world's biggest and most profitable companies - as well as a consistently-growing company - to a list of blue-chip stocks that should see a bit of a bump on the heels of yet-another solid earnings report. But, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is a name that you don't want to bet against.The past couple of earnings reports created particularly strong, bullish responses. AAPL stock jumped 6% on Aug. 1 following the release of its fiscal Q3 numbers , and it was up more than 4% on May 2 on the heels of its fiscal Q2 report . And more than that, both earnings reports ultimately prompted what's become a 30% gain since early May.Apple will post its fiscal Q4 results on Nov. 1.Herbalife Nutrition (NYSE: HLF ) is one of those names that has severely punished anyone who bet against it in front of recent earnings reports. Granted, the post-earnings pops are short-lived events. The stock ultimately ended up moving lower than it was right before the company released its quarterly numbers in early May and early August. But, what a ride while it lasted!The specifics: HLF stock surged 4.4% on May 4, and was up 13% on Aug. 3, following its prior two earnings reports … and was also up a little more two days after their last two earnings releases. That, however, was about as far as the post-earnings bullishness went.Herbalife has managed to beat its earnings estimates for three straight quarters now, and will hopefully make it four in a row come Oct. 30.Becton Dickinson (NYSE: BDX ) isn't exactly a household name. Though it sports a market cap of $61 billion, the medical equipment company just doesn't turn many heads.But, maybe it should. The company has topped quarterly earnings estimates in years, and hasn't failed to grow them in years.That said, know that BDX stock isn't one that normally takes flight immediately after better-than-expected reports of earnings growth. But, down 7% just since the end of last month, Becton Dickinson could be ripe for a news-based reversal.AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV ) has been a little more hit-and-miss following the delivery of quarterly reports of late … and arguably more miss than hit. The stock's down 34% from its February high, and hasn't always responded well to the company's earnings news.The company itself, however, has done everything it's supposed to do … and more. Decided year-over-year earnings growth is the norm in every quarter, and AbbVie hasn't failed to top a quarterly earnings estimate in years. Better still, sales of its lymphoma drug Imbruvica are still in ramp-up mode after winning approval for new indications, growing 35% during the second quarter to $850 million. The company anticipates peak sales of $7 billion for Imbruvica , leaving the company plenty of room to keep growing its top and bottom lines despite its Humira headwind.All of a sudden the stock's big pullback this year looks like an opportunity, underscored by a forward-looking P/E of only 9.3.The advent of the Affordable Care Act may have flooded UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH ) with revenue-bearing customers, but this business wasn't necessarily profitable. Though revenue has grown every quarter since 2012 , net income has been flat, and occasionally negative on a year-over-year basis.That is, until 2016 when the health insurer started to drop participation in ACA exchanges in more and more states. It turned out to be the right move . And now, President Donald Trump's version of what healthcare should look like in the United States could prove even more beneficial to the company . Thing is, most investors have yet to take a good long look at how well UnitedHealth is growing again. Revenue is on pace to grow 12% this year , driving a 27% increase in per-share profits.Though the company won't post its next quarterly report until January, it may be worth the wait if that's when the market finally realizes what's going on.1Curiously, Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) shares have not responded favorably to any of the company recent quarterly reports … a strange outcome in light of the fact that revenue and earnings have both been growing like crazy since 2015. The organization has developed an entire suite of cloud-based business tools, and the world loves them.Take a closer look at the stock's chart though. While ADBE stock often peels back following an earnings report, the bigger-picture trend is still bullish. Adobe shares are up more than 200% since their early 2016 low, and despite the pullback from their peak early last month, the bigger trend is still a bullish one.It may take a while for Adobe stock to respond bullishly to a positive earnings report, but it will likely be worth the wait.Boeing (NYSE: BA ) shares don't have much of a history of jumping following quarterly earnings reports. In fact, BA stock doesn't have much of a bullish history at all for the past several months. The current price of $347 is right where the stock was back in February. Shares just can't get airborne.Something has changed for the better though. That is, the perception of Boeing's future is much brighter than it was just a few quarters ago. With its most recent passenger jet market outlook, Boeing opined that the airline industry would need to take delivery of more than 42,000 aircraft over the course of the next 20 years to meet the demand stemming from an annualized increase 4.7% in air travel for the same timeframe. Better yet, investors are starting to understand how Boeing fits into the picture. It's still the preferred provider of the world's passenger jets, setting the stage for a bullish response to proof that it's growing.The company will get another chance to prove it on Oct. 24, when it's expected to post its quarterly results.It's often left out of the discussion about the broad technology market, as it doesn't make the microprocessors, graphics cards and memory chips that dominate the landscape. Don't let the lack of attention fool you though. Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN ) is as much of a tech name as any other player, supplying many of the less-touted components that are still just as necessary to make the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence work.TXN stock doesn't necessarily bolt higher in response to earnings reports; it very much does its own thing, with bad news or good. But, down more than 15% just since August's high, the earnings news due after the closing bell rings on Oct. 23 may remind the market that the company has topped estimates in eleven of its prior twelve quarters. Tuesday's could be the thirteenth.Finally, the industry be old, but railroading is still relevant. That's why CSX (NASDAQ: CSX ) is one of the few blue-chip stocks to buy for traders looking to juice their portfolio.Yes, the meltdown of oil and coal prices a couple of years back proved problematic. This year has been a different story though. With the United States now the world's biggest producer of crude and coal at least making some sort of comeback, this year's rail traffic in the U.S. is as robust as it has been in four years . That bodes well for CSX, which has not only topped earnings estimates in each of its past four quarters, but has logged outstanding earnings growth. The bottom line is expected to grow 66% this year, and keep growing next year.CSX stock has pulled back since last week's third-quarter release , and won't report again until January. It's one of those names, though, that could be worth the wait. This company is quietly standing in the middle of the economic revival, even if few people have taken notice yet.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Notable Tuesday Option Activity: AMZN, IQV, AAPL
 Wall Street, which had a pretty strong third quarter, has not seen a smooth opening to the fourth quarter. There was a brutal selloff in early-October, thanks apparently to rising rate concerns, and since then the market has remained edgy. The slump was primarily triggered by tech blues as panic-selling caused a rout in the high-flying tech names like Apple AAPL  , Amazon AMZN  and Alphabet GOOGL  (read: Profit From Market Bloodbath With These Inverse ETFs  ).In fact, the tech-heavyNasdaq composite index saw its biggest loss in more than two years on Oct 10. Along with several analysts, we also believe the vast selloff in tech stocks was just because of overvaluation concerns and investors' indulgence in profit booking.Per an article published on Associated Press  , technology and Internet-based companies normally record high profit margins. Now, in a rising rate environment, profitability of those companies will be compromised as they will end up paying higher interests on borrowed money. This stretches the stocks' already-hefty valuations.However, investors should note that this sudden rout in the tech sector seems to be passing and is will longer bear a long-term impact. There are plenty of favorable factors that justify a buy-the-dip-in-tech ETFs. Investors should note that the sector is winning investors back slowly as Invesco QQQ Trust ( QQQ )  attracted $425.8 million from Oct 14 to Oct 23.    Why The Sector Could Bounce Back Soon The technology sector has been on sturdier ground, with full-year earnings up 16% in 2017 and   expected to grow 21.1%    in 2018. Rising enterprise spending, the tailwind of tax cuts and emerging technologies like cloud computing, artificial intelligence and big data are the wind beneath the wings of the tech sector (see  all technology ETFs  here).Investors should note that tech behemoths hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from Trump's repatriation tax policy. Also, investors can expect higher dividend distribution or share buyback from this move. Plus, a pickup in the global economy is great for a cyclical sector like technology (read:  5 Tech ETFs That Crushed FANG ETFs in 2017  ).Goldman Sach's strategists led by David Kostin believe that " computer and software makers are cheaper  than they've been historically, and fund managers currently hold fewer tech stocks than their representation in benchmark indexes," as noted in Bloomberg. Goldman sees risks of '" overcrowding and outperformance" as exaggerated.Goldman showed that tech shares traded at a P/E ratio that is 7% higher than the S&P 500 index, well under the average premium of 30% over the past three decades. If a sector like technology is delivering profit margins twice the broader market, such nominal premium is justified.And investors who are still on shaky ground may take a look at a few tech ETFs that were among the less-punished in the past week (as of Oct 19, 2018). Notably, the largest tech ETF Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF XLK  lost about 0.8% in the past week. ETFs in Focus  SPDR S&P Technology Hardware ETF ( XTH )  - Up 3.41% ETFMG Prime Mobile Payments ETF ( IPAY )  - Up 1.58% First Trust NASDAQ CEA Smartphone Index Fund ( FONE )  - Up 0.84% Invesco S&P SmallCap Information Technology ETF ( PSCT )  - Up 0.54% Defiance Quantum ETF  QTUM  - Up 0.27% SPDR S&P Software & Services ETF  XSW  - Down 0.48% Want key ETF info delivered straight to your   inbox?

    On today's episode of the Tech Talk Tuesday podcast, Ryan McQueeney discusses the state of the FAANG stocks as Q3 earnings season continues to heat up. Notably, the host provides previews for two FAANG members-Amazon and Alphabet-due to report earnings this week.Remember to subscribe and leave a rating on Apple Podcasts  if you enjoy the show!U.S. stocks were plunging on Tuesday morning, although some respite was given to those delivering strong earnings results before the bell.That give hope to investors in the FAANG group-Facebook FB  , Amazon AMZN  , Apple AAPL  , Netflix NFLX  , and Alphabet GOOGL  , which has felt the brunt of the selling in recent weeks-as most will report their latest earnings results in the coming days.Netflix set the tone for the FAANGs last week, but initial post-earnings gains have already been forfeited amid continued market-wide volatility. Now, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet will join the earnings fray this week, and sentiment ahead of the reports is mixed.Amazon has seen positive earnings estimate revisions for the to-be reported quarter within the past 30 days, and analysts raising their estimates ahead of a report date is typically a pretty bullish indicator. That said, Amazon's actual earnings results in recent quarters have come in so much higher than estimates that one might consider projections to be unreliable, or even unimportant.Bottom-line estimates aside, investors will certainly be hoping for strong results in Amazon's key growth segments, including its cloud computing division and its new brick-and-mortar ventures.Earnings revisions and recent results have also been strong for Alphabet, although the search engine giant is facing a plethora of other questions ahead of its latest report. Consensus estimates are still calling for earnings growth of 10% and revenue growth of 22%, but investors have expressed concern about the effect that broader data privacy concerns might have on Google's business.Ryan covers both Amazon's and Alphabet's upcoming reports in depth on today's show. He also briefly touches on the reports of Facebook and Apple, which are due out next week.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors on Wall Street continue to contend with a choppy and uncertain trading environment, even among popular sectors like tech stocks. The harrowing losses of two weeks ago - driven by worries over rising interest rates and a hawkish Federal Reserve - have mostly faded away. But last week's ebullient rebound has stalled, leaving the action listless.A growing chorus on Wall Street is sounding the alarm, with analysts at Morgan Stanley warning that the large-cap stocks in the S&P 500 are the only holdout from a "rolling bear market' that has already savaged pretty much every other asset class, including small-cap stocks, high-yield bonds, and emerging market assets. The fact that the S&P 500 is once again below its 200-day moving average supports this thesis, weighed down by bank stocks.Yet tech stocks - which have been the performance vanguard for months - are desperately trying to climb higher. So which is right? Bank stocks or big tech stocks? For investors ready to pick a side, here are eight stocks (four from each camp) to watch:Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) stock is testing above the $1,800 level, remaining well above its 200-day moving average as it consolidates a 17%-plus decline from its early October double-top high. Despite the recent price unpleasantness for this and other tech stocks, analysts at Credit Suisse raised their price target this week and are now penciling in $2,400 vs. $2,100 previously.The company will next report results on Oct. 25 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $3.12 on earnings of $57.1 billion. When the company last reported on July 26, earnings of $5.07 beat estimates by $2.53 on a 39.3% rise in revenues.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock is testing above its 50-day moving average, trying to lift off of a multiweek consolidation near the $215 level. Analysts at Wedbush recently initiated coverage with a $310 price target and an addition to its Best Ideas List. They believe the company's market capitalization can swell towards $1.5 trillion on the continued success of the iPhone and their belief in a strong upgrade cycle in 2019.The company will next report results on Nov. 1 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.78 per share on revenues of $61.5 billion.When the company last reported on July 31, earnings of $2.34 beat estimates by 16 cents per share on a 17.3% rise in revenues.Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) stock is crawling higher, trying to move back over the $250-a-share threshold after catching a bounce on its 200-day moving average. Watch for another run at its 50-day moving average. Shares zoomed higher last week after management reaffirmed its fourth quarter guidance and said it expects fiscal 2019 revenue to be up 20%.The company will next report results on Dec. 13 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.89 per share on revenues of $2.4 billion. When the company last reported on Sept. 13, earnings of $1.73 per share beat estimates by four cents on a 24.4% rise in revenues.Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) stock is trying to build a base of support near the lows around $44, a level first reached back in early September setting in a run at its 200-day moving average near $49. That last was last tested earlier this month. Street opinion is divided on the chipmaker, with Nomura analysts defending their recent upgrade to buy on CNBC while B Riley analysts lowered their price target ahead of Thursday's earnings results.The company will next report results on Oct. 25 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.15 per share on revenues of $18.1 billion.When the company last reported on July 26, earnings of $1.04 beat estimates by eight cents on a 14.9% rise in revenues. It's worth a look when seeking tech stocks to buy.Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) stock is looking downright ugly on Monday, breaking down below its early July low to return to levels not seen since late 2017. Initially, higher interest rates were seen as a boon to the banks because it meant higher net interest margins on loans as the "cost of credit" rose. Problem is, as any Econ 101 student will tell you, as prices rise demand falls. Thus, with evidence consumers are slowing down things like mortgage originations, investors are bailing out of bank stocks.The company will next report results on Jan. 16 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 65 cents per share on revenues of $22.6 billion. When the company last reported on Oct. 15, earnings of 66 cents per share beat estimates by four cents on a 3.2% rise in revenues.JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM ) stock is threatening to fall below its mid-October low setting up a decline back to levels not seen since early July. Already down nearly 11% from its September high, a drop to that level would be worth another 4% drop from here. The selloff represents the first major violation of the 50-week moving average since the summer of 2016, so it's a big deal.The company will next report results on Jan. 15 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.27 per share on revenues of $27.4 billion.When the company last reported on Oct. 12, earnings of $2.34 beat estimates by nine cents on a 7.8% rise in revenues.Citigroup (NYSE: C ) stock is breaking down out of a multimonth consolidation range, returning to levels not seen since July as it falls further away from its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The company was among the weaker performers last quarter, managing just a 7.3% return on equity vs. 14% for JPM, for instance. Shares are already down nearly 16% from their January high.The company will next report results on Jan. 14 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.64 per share on revenues of $18.1 billion. When the company last reported on Oct. 12 earnings of $1.73 per share beat estimates by four cents despite a 0.2% drop in revenues.Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ) stock is testing critical support near its 200-week moving average, a level that held during selloffs in April as well as in September 2017. Shares of this bank stock are already in a bear market, down more than 20% from its January high, despite a recent upgrade by analysts at Macquarie.The company will next report results on Jan. 15 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.18 per share on revenues of $21.6 billion.When the company last reported on Oct. 12, earnings of $1.13 missed estimates by four cents on a 0.4% rise in revenues.As of this writing, William Roth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post Banks vs. Big Tech: 4 to Buy, 4 to Sell appeared first on InvestorPlace .
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and  Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) are joining forces to bring Alexa headphones to market. Until now,  Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has been doing pretty well with its wireless headphones business. And now, two of its rivals - including AAPL legal team's current enemy number one QCOM - are crashing that party.Qualcomm announced the release of a chip that will make it easy for any headphone manufacturer to embed voice-activated Alexa in their product. The end result is expected to be a flood of Alexa headphones, Bluetooth headphones and earbuds that can take on Apple's popular AirPods, but with Amazon's Alexa onboard instead of Siri.Manufacturers seem to have the whole smart speaker thing down pat at this point, but getting a smart voice assistant like Alexa in a set of headphones has proven a little more challenging. At the start of the year, I reviewed the first set of Alexa headphones, the PRO Voice from 66 Audio . They worked very well and proved the usefulness of having Alexa voice control in a headset, but to get there, 66 Audio engineers had to work closely with Amazon for a year and a half.Yesterday, Qualcomm announced its Smart Headset Reference Design for Amazon Alexa Voice Service . That's a rambling, technical term for what is essentially an off-the-shelf solution to make Alexa headphones. QCOM supplies a Bluetooth chip and the necessary software to enable the headphones to send voice commands to the Alexa app running on an Android smartphone, and receive responses from the Alexa app.Speaking to Reuters , Qualcomm explained the advantage to headphone manufacturers of adopting its design:"This radically reduces their [engineering] cost and time to market. It makes it simple for the industry to adopt this."Smart speakers have been the latest battleground for the adoption of personal digital assistants, and Amazon has been leading that market with its Echo lineup. The company is leveraging that success to put Alexa support into a wide range of smart home products , including microwaves.Wireless headphones have been more Apple's thing. Its Beats brand is one of the top sellers and when it comes to integrated voice assistant smart headphones, Apple's AirPods virtually own the market. Seven months after launch (long after the rush of early adopters), AAPL AirPods accounted for a whopping 85% of consumer spending on completely wireless headphones in the U.S. The total global market for headphones is expected to pass the $20 billion mark by 2023 .While it's always possible Amazon could put its own name on Alexa headphones to scoop up some of that revenue, the QCOM reference design is intended to make it easy for third-party manufacturers to make Alexa headphones. And that would be the real win for AMZN.A requirement for that setup is having Amazon's Alexa app installed on the user's smartphone. Smartphones running Android have Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google Assistant onboard and iPhones have Siri. Those smartphones have billions of users, giving Apple and Google a significant advantage over AMZN, which lacks its own smartphone platform. (The Alexa app is available in both Apple's App Store and the Google Play store, however.) Echo smart speakers were a way around that problem.A flood of Alexa headphones would expand Amazon's footprint on smartphones, and once there AMZN would have a chance to displace Siri and Google Assistant.QCOM has had a rough go of things over the past several years. It has faced regulatory fines over its business practices. It not only lost Apple as a customer, it is embroiled in a lengthy legal battle with the company. Meanwhile, leading Android smartphone manufacturers like Samsung and Huawei are increasingly ditching QCOM's Snapdragon for their own chip designs.Diversification is key for Qualcomm at this point, whether that's pushing  smartwatch chips , or selling headphone manufacturers an off-the-shelf solution for Alexa integration.Wireless headphones are a big business that's getting bigger. More smartphones are ditching the headphone jack, while streaming music services continue to grow. Consumers are replacing their wired headphones with Bluetooth versions, and Apple AirPods have proved smart is popular. Even Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is getting in the game with new Cortana-equipped Surface headphones . Alexa headphones using Qualcomm's reference design make it easy for third parties to ride the smart wireless headphones wave, with upside for both QCOM stock and AMZN stock if they take off.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s.The post Amazon and Qualcomm Team Up to Bring Alexa to Headphones appeared first on InvestorPlace .
Apple's Cook set to back strong privacy laws in Europe, U.S. at Brussels event
 By Foo Yun Chee and Stephen Nellis BRUSSELS/SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Apple  Chief Executive Tim Cook is expected to praise new European privacy rules and to voice the company's support for strong laws in Europe and the United States to protect the use of data, according to prepared remarks for delivery at a Brussels event. Cook will describe Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, as an example of how "good policy and political will can come together to protect the rights of us all," according to the remarks, seen by Reuters ahead of a gathering of international privacy regulators on Wednesday. Issues over how data is used and how consumers can protect their personal information have come under the spotlight recently following massive breaches of data privacy involving millions of internet and social media users in Europe and the United States. Cook, scheduled to be the keynote speaker at the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners, will be one of several executives from U.S. tech companies to present their views at the two-day event. Facebook  CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google  CEO Sundar Pichai will share their thoughts via video messages. But Apple, which designs many of its products so that it can't see users' data, was expected to send Cook to speak in person. The iPhone maker has largely avoided the data privacy scandals that have affected its rivals Google and Facebook this year. In particular, Cook has publicly criticized Facebook's business model, arguing it depends on building out detailed profiles of users in order to target advertisements. Apple views privacy as a "fundamental human right," Cook is expected to say at the event. "We will never achieve technology's true potential without the full faith and confidence of the people who use it," he will say. Other U.S. tech giants such as Amazon, Alphabet Inc, AT&T Inc, Charter Communications Inc  and Twitter Inc  have said they would back new federal privacy regulations. Technology companies have been concerned about strict and varying state-level privacy laws in the United States, such as the one signed into law by California Governor Jerry Brown earlier this year that goes into effect in 2020. Such laws could create a patchwork of differing regulations across the United States that could be difficult to comply with. A uniform federal law could supersede state-level rules. 
 
Top Technology Stocks:MSFT: -1.47%AAPL: -1.72%IBM: -0.97%CSCO: -1.40%GOOG: -1.60%Tuesday's pre-market trade saw declining technology stocks.Early movers include:(-) Logitech International S.A ( LOGI  ), which was down by over 9% after it reported fiscal Q2 adjusted earnings that were better-than-expected on improved revenues which were shy of forecasts compiled by Capital IQ.(+) Cadence Design Systems ( CDNS  ) was advancing by more than 8% as it reported Q3 non-GAAP earnings of $0.49 per share, up from $0.35 per share in the year-ago quarter and better than the analyst consensus of $0.41 per share on Capital IQ.In other sector news:(-) SAP ( SAP  ) was down by almost 1.5% after it said five new machine learning services are planned for the remainder of the year: scene text recognition, customizable image segmentation, customizable text feature extraction, cloud text-to-speech by Google, and cloud speech-to-text by Google.
If history is any indication, analysts are understandably  bullish about Microsoft's first-quarter earnings on Wednesday-especially in the wake of its drubbing during tech's big selloff  earlier this month. Microsoft  (MSFT) has beaten analysts' revenue estimates 19 of the last 20 quarters, and it is expected to report earnings of 96 cents per share on revenue of $27.88 billion, each up 14% from a year ago, according to FactSet.More important, Microsoft's earnings should provide a key harbinger for the state of tech.  Microsoft stock  dropped from $115.17 per share on Oct. 3 to $105.91 on Oct. 11. Microsoft stock is up about 28% this year, outpacing the S&P 500's 3% gain. Netflix did the trick last week, with better-than-expected results and subscription growth that allayed investors-and jet-propelled the stock 12% in after-hours trading. Now, it's Microsoft's turn, and analysts like the odds.Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Kash Rangan said in a note Monday that he expects Microsoft to beat expectations on both revenue and earnings per share, driven by strength in cloud computing and more. He raised his price target to $136 from $134, and maintained a Buy recommendation.The company's shift to cloud computing is "a major secular trend that is significantly benefiting [Microsoft] in the field as a key tailwind and should continue its momentum" heading into fiscal year 2019, Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, said in a note Friday initiating its coverage of Microsoft. He has an Outperform rating and price target of $140 on the stock. Ives expects Microsoft to join Apple  (AAPL) and Amazon  (AMZN) in the $1 trillion club  within six months."Microsoft is firing on all cylinders," Ives told Barron's. Credit Suisse analyst Brad Zelnick summed up the sentiment in another note Monday that concluded Microsoft's burgeoning cloud business and Microsoft 365 products have greatly diversified its product portfolio to complement "strong commercial PC demand."In its previous quarter, Microsoft reported that revenue for its Azure cloud service rose 89% year-over-year, one of several factors that contributed to the first $100 billion year in revenue for the 43-year-old company.
 By Amy Caren Daniel Oct 23 (Reuters) - Wall Street sank on Tuesday as disappointing forecasts from industrial bellwethers Caterpillar and 3M triggered alarm bells over corporate growth and added to concerns ranging from China's slowdown to Saudi Arabia's diplomatic isolation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell to its lowest since July, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq retreated to levels last seen in May, continuing a punishing month for U.S. stocks. Caterpillar  tumbled 7.9 percent after the heavy-duty equipment maker maintained its 2018 earnings forecast, while 3M Co  slid 6.9 percent after cutting its full-year profit forecast due to currency headwinds.  The forecasts from the two Dow Industrials reignited worries over the impact of rising borrowing costs, wages and tariffs on corporate profits and caused S&P industrial stocks  to slide 2.49 percent. Along with worries over profit growth, concerns over events such as the upcoming U.S mid-term elections and Italy's budget have also sent investors scrambling out of stocks. "We are in a risk-off environment right now. Markets are worried about politics and earnings," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York. "Results from Caterpillar and 3M are an additional concern that the trade tensions are indeed pressuring corporate earnings and we possibly have been seeing a peak in earnings growth." The beaten-down technology sector  fell 2.28 percent, in tandem with global peers, over concerns of slowing growth in China and ahead of key earnings. Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft  and Intel, all due to report this week, were down between 1.7 percent and 3.4 percent. Apple  fell 1.7 percent. Profits of S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 22.1 percent in the third quarter, slower than the previous two quarters, according to Refinitiv data. Growth is expected to slow to 19.6 percent in the fourth quarter. At 11:10 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was down 368.34 points, or 1.45 percent, at 24,949.07, the S&P 500  was down 45.23 points, or 1.64 percent, at 2,710.65 and the Nasdaq Composite  was down 151.30 points, or 2.03 percent, at 7,317.33. The CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street's fear gauge, rose 3.0 points, its sharpest jump in nearly two weeks. All 11 major S&P sectors were in the red, with the defensive utilities, real estate  and consumer staples  indexes posting the smallest losses. Energy stocks  fell 2.93 percent, the most among the sectors, as oil prices fell after Saudi Arabia said it could supply more crude quickly if needed.  Chipmakers, which rely heavily on China for a significant portion of their revenue, led the losses among tech stocks. All members of the Philadelphia semiconductor index  were in the red, led by Nvidia's  5.0 percent slide. However, all earnings report on the day were not disheartening. McDonald's  rose 5.8 percent after it beat estimates for quarterly same-store sales as strong demand in international markets.  Verizon  gained 3.6 percent to hit an 18-1/2 year high after beating estimates for profit and net new phone subscribers.  Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 5.49-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 4.80-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded two new 52-week highs and 86 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded two new highs and 344 new lows.

 NAIROBI, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Kenya's minister of information, communication and technology said on Tuesday that the government had set aside 1 billion shillings ($9.90 million) to help local start-ups in the mobile telephone software and hardware segments to grow. Joe Mucheru, the ICT minister, told the annual meeting of the ICT industry in the capital Nairobi that he was concerned by the country's imports of 50 million telephone handsets every two years, challenging local firms to start making them locally. ICT is one of the fastest growing sectors in Kenya's economy due to demand for services like high speed internet access and mobile financial services like M-Pesa, operated by Safaricom. But African nations like Kenya, who do not have a solid industrial base, have been trying to replace imports with local products in order to save their hard currency and remove pressure on their foreign exchange rates. The government would work with firms that seek to participate in the manufacturing and assembling of phones, in order to drive down their costs, Mucheru said. "Why can't we leverage on the skills available locally to manufacture these handsets that are suitable for our markets?" he asked.

Verizon beats Wall Street estimates, shares hit 18-year high
 By Sheila  Dang and Akanksha Rana Oct 23 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc reported quarterly profit and net new phone subscribers well ahead of Wall Street estimates on Tuesday, as customers took advantage of its subsidies for Apple Inc's  latest iPhones late in the quarter.  The largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers has been focusing on upgrading its network and winning over more customers in a saturated market as rivals AT&T Inc , Sprint Corp and T-Mobile have been focusing on merger deals and paying down debt. The company said it added a net 295,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill during the third quarter, easily beating the estimate of 161,000 provided by research firm FactSet.  Wall Street analysts pay attention to customers with a recurring bill, or so-called "postpaid" customers, as they are more valuable to carriers. Verizon has been investing heavily this year in its next generation 5G network, which will become the backbone of its largest business.  Meanwhile, its next-largest rival AT&T Inc  bought Time Warner for $85 billion, in a bet that it can use media content on its services to lure more customers. T-Mobile and Sprint Corp, the third and fourth-placed U.S. carriers, have agreed to merge in the hope of cutting costs and becoming more competitive.  AT&T and Sprint have been focusing on paying down debt rather than winning customers by lowering prices, which meant  Verizon did not face cut-throat competition in the quarter, said Craig Moffett, an analyst with MoffettNathanson. "Competitive intensity is now more moderate than at any time since 2014," said Moffett in a research note. "With two of the Big Four all but taking a knee, Verizon - and T-Mobile - now has the freedom to grow without discounting." 
 OATH INTEGRATION Verizon's media and traditional phone businesses did not fare as well.  Revenue from Oath, its digital media subsidiary that owns dozens of websites including AOL and Yahoo, fell 7 percent to $1.8 billion for the third quarter. Verizon said it does not expect Oath to reach its previous goal of $10 billion in revenue by 2020, as it struggles to generate as much revenue as it hoped from mobile advertising, to make up for shrinking desktop usage of its websites. Last month, Verizon said Oath CEO Tim Armstrong would leave the company at the end of the year. "I would expect the next move will be that the business is jettisoned entirely," said Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst with New Street Research. Verizon declined comment on any planned deals. Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said in an interview with Reuters that Oath's revenue trend had not met expectations, but the company is working to integrate its advertising sales platform this quarter. "That will make it easier for publishers to do business with us," Ellis said.  Net income attributable to the company rose to $4.92 billion, or $1.19 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, up from $3.62 billion, or 89 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding some items, Verizon earned $1.22 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.19 per share, according to Refinitiv data. Verizon said it is on track to reach $10 billion in cumulative cash savings by 2021. 
 5G ROLLOUT Verizon launched home 5G internet service on Oct. 1 in parts of Houston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles and Sacramento. The next-generation wireless network is expected to bring faster data speeds, which Verizon hopes will help it compete with competitors like cable company Comcast Corp. It has, so far, concentrated on investing in its wireless network rather than deal-making. Its next-largest competitor AT&T Inc  bought Time Warner in an $85 billion deal that closed in June, betting it could attract more customers with media content. Verizon's wireline business, which sells traditional phone service and its Fios video and internet products, saw revenue decline 3.7 percent from last year to $7.4 billion. It lost 63,000 Fios video subscribers during the quarter, more than the 18,000 it lost last year, as viewers continue to favor cheaper TV services delivered over the internet, over paying for pricier cable packages. It added 54,000 Fios internet customers, fewer than the 66,000 Verizon added a year earlier. Total operating revenue rose 2.8 percent to $32.61 billion during the quarter, beating analysts' average estimate of $32.51 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

 OATH INTEGRATION Verizon's media and traditional phone businesses did not fare as well.  Revenue from Oath, its digital media subsidiary that owns dozens of websites including AOL and Yahoo, fell 7 percent to $1.8 billion for the third quarter. Verizon said it does not expect Oath to reach its previous goal of $10 billion in revenue by 2020, as it struggles to generate as much revenue as it hoped from mobile advertising, to make up for shrinking desktop usage of its websites. Last month, Verizon said Oath CEO Tim Armstrong would leave the company at the end of the year. "I would expect the next move will be that the business is jettisoned entirely," said Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst with New Street Research. Verizon declined comment on any planned deals. Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said in an interview with Reuters that Oath's revenue trend had not met expectations, but the company is working to integrate its advertising sales platform this quarter. "That will make it easier for publishers to do business with us," Ellis said.  Net income attributable to the company rose to $4.92 billion, or $1.19 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, up from $3.62 billion, or 89 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding some items, Verizon earned $1.22 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.19 per share, according to Refinitiv data. Verizon said it is on track to reach $10 billion in cumulative cash savings by 2021. 
 5G ROLLOUT Verizon launched home 5G internet service on Oct. 1 in parts of Houston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles and Sacramento. The next-generation wireless network is expected to bring faster data speeds, which Verizon hopes will help it compete with competitors like cable company Comcast Corp. It has, so far, concentrated on investing in its wireless network rather than deal-making. Its next-largest competitor AT&T Inc  bought Time Warner in an $85 billion deal that closed in June, betting it could attract more customers with media content. Verizon's wireline business, which sells traditional phone service and its Fios video and internet products, saw revenue decline 3.7 percent from last year to $7.4 billion. It lost 63,000 Fios video subscribers during the quarter, more than the 18,000 it lost last year, as viewers continue to favor cheaper TV services delivered over the internet, over paying for pricier cable packages. It added 54,000 Fios internet customers, fewer than the 66,000 Verizon added a year earlier. Total operating revenue rose 2.8 percent to $32.61 billion during the quarter, beating analysts' average estimate of $32.51 billion, according to Refinitiv data. 
 
 Oct 23 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc  on Tuesday beat Wall Street estimates for net new phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill, helped by promotions for Apple Inc's  new iPhone. The largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers said it added a net 295,000 phone subscribers during the third quarter, beating estimates of 161,000 new subscribers, according to research firm FactSet.  Total operating revenue rose 2.8 percent to $32.61 billion during the quarter, beating analysts' estimates of $32.51 billion, according to Refinitiv data. 
Apple's Cook backs strong privacy laws in Europe, U.S. - remarks
 By Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Apple  Chief Executive Tim Cook is expected to stress the iPhone maker's commitment to privacy and backing for strong laws on both sides of the Atlantic to protect the use of data, according to remarks prepared for delivery at a Brussels event. Issues over how data is used and how consumers can protect their personal information have come under the spotlight recently following massive breaches of data privacy involving millions of internet and social media users in Europe and the United States. Facebook  CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google  CEO Sundar Pichai will also share their thoughts via video messages. Apple views privacy as a "fundamental human right", Cook will say. "We will never achieve technology's true potential without the full faith and confidence of the people who use it," he will say. Cook also endorsed a comprehensive federal privacy law in the United States, the strongest statement by Apple to date. Other U.S. tech giants such as Amazon, Alphabet Inc, AT&T Inc, Charter Communications Inc  and Twitter Inc  have said they would back new federal privacy regulations. 
 
 By Kirsti Knolle VIENNA, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Apple  chip supplier AMS AG  disappointed investors with its fourth quarter forecast, knocking 25 percent off the value of its shares despite the Austrian firm winning deals with other smartphone makers. AMS shares hit a 20-month low on Tuesday after some analysts questioned whether the chipmaker specialising in sensors could achieve its $2.7 billion 2019 revenue target amid signs of weakening chip demand. AMS, which has invested heavily in research and development and in production expansion, is now tackling underutilised facilities, increasing competition and its reliance on Apple. Analysts forecast that to reach its 2019 revenue target, AMS needs two or three significant new deals, something that the company's chief executive Alexander Everke said was achievable. "We have multiple wins and we do see that growth that you have just described. All the investments we have done... support the growth we indicated for 2019," Everke told an analyst call. AMS said its third-quarter EBIT (earnings before interest and taxation) rose to $60.2 million, or 13 percent of revenue, from $40.5 million last year thanks to increasing production volumes for a recently launched global smartphone platform. While it does not identify its customers, this was taken as a reference to Apple, which analysts estimate accounts for around 40 percent of AMS sales. After a delay of several months, production for Apple appears on track and analysts estimate that AMS's facial recognition sensors are in all three newly launched iPhones. 
 FACING THE WORLD To reduce its Apple dependency, AMS has been working on selling sensors to Android customers. This has become more important after the U.S. tech giant struck a $600 million deal with German rival Dialog Semiconductors this month.  Swiss-listed AMS also announced new deals on Monday, including two with Asian smartphone producers for its Android time-of-flight solutions, a method where cameras capture a whole scene in three dimensions with a dedicated image sensor. AMS also said it has started to produce 3D face recognition sensors for two Android customers, including China'sXiaomi, the fourth-biggest smartphone maker. Huawei's  new Mate20 Pro phones also use AMS sensors for facial recognition, analysts say, adding the second-biggest smartphone maker to the AMS customer list.  AMS said it had secured a deal for OLED-display sensors, which are thinner and more flexible than LEDs, with a major Asian manufacturer, and is working on sensors that are capable of scanning surroundings in 3D, so-called world-facing 3D sensors, for a major smartphone manufacturer. After a strategic review, AMS said it plans to reduce its focus on environmental sensors, which detect temperature or moisture, but did not say whether this business would be sold. That leaves it with three main businesses: optical sensors, such as the ones used in the new iPhones, image sensors for applications in self-driving cars and audio sensors.

 It should come as no surprise that   Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) utterly dominates the installed base of smart   speakers in the U.S. The e-commerce giant was able to   successfully leverage its first-mover advantage and rapidly   expand its smart speaker portfolio to address a diverse range of   price points, ensuring there was something for everyone. It's   true that   Alphabet    (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary Google has gained   considerable traction recently, with Strategy Analytics saying   that the Google Home Mini was the   best-selling smart speaker in the second   quarter    .Google may be catching up in terms of quarterly sales, but   Amazon is still the top dog by far when it comes to the installed   base.  Amazon's newest Echo Show. Image source: Amazon. Strategy Analytics    has just put out its most recent estimates, which are based on a   survey (n = 1,011) of U.S. consumers conducted during July and   August. The findings show that Amazon represents 63% of smart   speakers currently in use when you aggregate all of its various   Echo models. Google is carving out a piece of the market for   itself, while   Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL) HomePod only appeals to buyers in the premium   segment of the space. However, HomePod's position is comparable   to Google Home Max, the only other device positioned in the   $300-$400 range.DeviceInstalled Base ShareEcho23%Echo Dot21%Google Home8%Google Home Mini7%Echo Plus5%Echo Spot4%Echo Show4%Echo Dot Kids Edition4%HomePod4%Google Home Max2%Data source: Strategy Analytics.Interestingly, the data also suggests that many consumers do   not feel tied to one particular platform or the other: 88% of   respondents own an Amazon device while 31% report owning a Google   smart speaker. Many smart-home device manufacturers support both   platforms, allowing users to use either Alexa or Google Assistant   interchangeably to control home automation. Both Alexa and Google   Assistant also integrate with   Spotify    , covering that popular use case as well.That has competitive implications. Users don't feel locked   into a platform after initially buying into one, giving greater   opportunities for companies to compete. Consider the fact that   only 54% of respondents were planning on buying an Amazon,   Google, or Apple device next, meaning that nearly half of the   rest of the market is open to smart speaker devices from less   prominent manufacturers like Bose or   freshly public Sonos    , among others. However, those manufacturers mostly just   integrate Alexa and Google Assistant, inevitably still feeding   users back into those platforms.Another important takeaway from the results is that most   people now own multiple speakers, with 58% of respondents saying   they have two or more smart speakers in their homes. Getting   devices into every room has always been the goal, and companies   are making progress on that front (except for Apple, that is, as   HomePod's $350 price point makes that an expensive proposition).   For now, Amazon can keep its title as the king of smart   speakers.  10 stocks we like better than Amazon       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

This New Business Could Soon Bring in Billions for Apple
 At face value,   Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL) hard-line stance on privacy would seem to   conflict with advertising business models. CEO Tim Cook has said   on numerous occasions that users are the product for advertising   companies, not whatever online software or services those   companies may offer for free. The Mac maker had previously   dabbled in mobile ads with iAd, a mobile ad network built with   its 2010 acquisition of   Quattro Wireless    , primarily as a way to help developers better monetize their   apps and content. Apple shut down iAd at the end of   2016.That may be why some investors could be surprised to hear that   advertising could soon be a multibillion-dollar business for   Apple.  The App Store now has millions of apps. Image source:     Apple.Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi has put out a research note   (reported by   CNBC    ) that predicts App Store Search Ads will bring in $500 million   in revenue in 2018, before soaring to $2 billion in revenue by   2020. Apple could easily end up generating more than that, as   Sacconaghi considers his estimate to be "conservative." To put   the $2 billion estimate into context, that would be about as much   revenue that Apple Music brought in last year, according to   Sacconaghi's estimates, except far more profitable.Search Ads are a fairly new business for Apple,   launching in the App Store back in late 2016. Developers can   purchase ads that show up at the top of App Store search results.   In line with   prior reports    , Apple also added a pay-per-install ad product -- an   extremely popular mobile ad format -- in 2017, where developers   only pay when the user downloads the advertised app.Apple approaches its ad load fairly conservatively, only   displaying a single ad on the first page of search results within   the App Store. Additionally, Apple does not offer Search Ads in   all markets. Geographical expansion (particularly in China) and   increased ad load could help that business grow significantly   going forward, in Sacconaghi's view.Given Apple's fundamental disdain of advertising, it's worth   noting how Search Ads don't violate its privacy principles. While   the company does allow Search Ads to be targeted to users   based on various criteria, Apple does not share or sell   individual user data to advertisers or third parties. Apple   doesn't track users, and users can also opt out of targeted ads.   You won't suddenly see display ads creepily following you around   the internet based on what you search for or click on in the App   Store.Apple also won't display any ads to minors under 13 years old,   or to accounts that are managed for educational organizations.   Only approved App Store content -- which has already been vetted   through the company's review processes -- can be advertised, so   users won't see inappropriate content.In other words, Search Ads have a very narrow and well-defined   purpose of content discovery exclusively within the App Store.   With as many apps as there are in the App Store (over 2   million), the importance of content discovery cannot be   understated. Apple is pulling on numerous levers in its effort to   grow its services business to around $50 billion by 2020, and   Search Ads is one of the more inconspicuous ones.  10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Amazon.com, Qualcomm to put Alexa assistant in more headphones
 By Stephen Nellis SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Microchip firm Qualcomm Inc  is joining Amazon.com Inc  to spread the use of Amazon's Alexa voice assistant in wireless headphones, the companies said on Monday. Under the deal, Qualcomm will release a set of chips that any maker of Bluetooth headphones can use to embed Alexa directly into the device. When the headphones are paired to a phone with the Alexa app on it, users will be able to talk to the voice assistant by tapping a button on the headphones. Amazon and Alphabet Inc'sGoogle, whose voice assistants have most often been found in their respective smart speakers for the home, are rushing to partner with headphone makers. Models from Bose Corp and Jabra feature Alexa built in, and Sony Corp  said earlier this year that a software update will make some of its headphone models work with Alexa. Google Assistant can be used on headphones from Bose, JBL and Sony, along with Google's own Pixel Buds. The Qualcomm partnership could expand that lineup. Qualcomm has developed a pre-made circuit that headphone makers can drop into their device to imbue it with Alexa. "This radically reduces their [engineering] cost and time to market," Anthony Murray, senior vice president and general manager of voice and music for Qualcomm, told Reuters in an interview. "It makes it simple for the industry to adopt this." Murray declined to comment on whether Qualcomm would make a similar offering for Google Assistant but said the chip firm  plans to support other partners in the future. The move is part of a broader push by Qualcomm to diversify away from its dependence on processor and modem chips for mobile phones. That business proved lucrative for Qualcomm, but its patent licensing model drew regulatory fines and lawsuits from customers such as Apple Inc. At a conference in Hong Kong slated for early Tuesday local time, Qualcomm also said it is working with action camera maker GoPro Inc  to put more Qualcomm chips for image processing in the devices. The firm has said it expects about $5 billion in revenue from non-mobile sources this year, or more than 20 percent of the $22.4 billion in sales that analysts  expect.

Launch of new iPhones helps chipmaker AMS's profit surge
 By Kirsti Knolle VIENNA, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Austrian chipmaker AMS AG  reported a 49 percent increase in its third-quarter core profit and gave an upbeat forecast for the next period, largely because Apple  started mass production of new phones that include its sensors. AMS is highly exposed to the smartphone and tablet markets and investors hope that new products launched in the second half of 2018 will lead to higher sales next year. AMS said third-quarter adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) reached $60.2 million or 13 percent of revenue from $40.5 million last year. The margin is expected to rise to 16 to 20 percent in the fourth quarter. "This expected positive result reflects the ramp-up nature of the quarter given increasing production volumes for a recently launched global smartphone platform," AMS said in a statement, adding it was making "very high volumes" for the programme. AMS does not identify its customers, but this was believed to be a reference to Apple. Revenues in the quarter reached $479.6 million (2017: $305.5 million) and are expected to rise to $570 to $610 million in the three months through December, AMS said. The optimism is also based on the fact that it has started to produce 3D face recognition sensors for two Android customers, the Swiss-listed company said. China'sXiaomi, the world's fourth-biggest smartphone maker, is one of them. Credit Suisse analysts think that Huawei's  new Mate20 Pro phones also use AMS's sensors for its face recognition feature, which would add the second-biggest smartphone maker to AMS's customers list.  The group said it was working on sensors that are capable of scanning surroundings in 3D, so-called world-facing 3D sensors, for a major smartphone manufacturer. Analysts have suggested that Apple could be working on such a project to assert dominance in augmented reality. AMS has been focusing on four businesses: optical sensors, such as the ones used in the new iPhones, image sensors for applications in self-driving cars, audio sensors such as microphones and environmental sensors, which detect temperature or moisture. In the future, it will reduce its efforts in environmental sensing and instead strongly focus on "very attractive mid- and long-term growth opportunities in optical technologies," the group said. "This includes new areas of innovation such as photonic elements and photoacoustic structures." Details will be announced with fourth-quarter results. 
 
Only a truly unloved stock can receive a Barron's recommendation and two Wall Street upgrades and erase all of the resulting gains by noon.Citizens Financial Group (ticker: CFG) initially rose more than 2% in early trading on Monday, after two analysts raised their ratings: Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) upgraded the shares to Buy from Underperform, and Macquarie raised its rating by one level to Neutral. Yet the stock was nearly flat at $36.36 by midmorning. (At least it outperformed the S&P 500's 0.2% decline.) The company was also selling $300 million of preferred shares Monday, with yield expected around 6.375%, according to early price talk.BAML's upgrade comes just three days after a better-than-expected earnings report and a bullish piece from Barron's, which drew attention to the steady growth in the regional bank's portfolio of commercial and consumer loans. The Rhode Island-based bank's loan growth has been fueled in part by a partnership with Apple (AAPL) to finance purchases of smartphones made directly from the manufacturer.And thanks to the lack of lasting gains on Monday, the most compelling part of the case for Citizens Financial's stock is still in place: The shares are extremely cheap.Bank of America Merrill Lynch focuses on valuations in its upgrade note on Monday. BAML is forecasting that the regional bank will report earnings per share of $3.90 next year. Even including the "material discount" at which Citizens trades (11 times earnings) compared with its regional-bank peers (13 times earnings), Citizens should trade at $43 per share, 18% above its midmorning price.So what's responsible for the discount? Macquarie thinks the explanation can be found in its relatively high "deposit beta," or the speed at which Citizens passes through interest-rate increases to investors after the Federal Reserve raises rates.In other words, the regional bank is being punished for giving individual depositors higher returns on their cash than its peers, a practice that is seen as increasing costs. BAML says that four rate increases in the next year would hit earnings per share by less than 1%.Even if we assume that such a hit justifies the discount assigned to Citizens' shares, BAML points out that "the market is pricing in a cost of equity at CFG that is about 350bp greater than for arguably [the] most complex bank globally-JPM."If Citizens makes just $3.75 per share in earnings next year, and commands a share price that's just 10 times those earnings-the S&P 500 trades at about 16 times next year's forecast earnings-that means it should a fair value of $37.50, still above its current share price, says BAML.If Citizens were valued at levels similar to its peers, it would command $51 per share, BAML says. That would be a 40% increase.Write to Alexandra Scaggs at alexandra.scaggs@barrons.com
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith the recent bearishness in the tech sector, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has fared relatively well. Since late August, the AAPL stock price is off only about 4% or so. By comparison, both Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Amazon  (NASDAQ: AMZN ) are down 11%.So does this mean the Apple stock may be a good value right now, especially since it has shown some durability?  Well, for the most part, I think investors should be cautious.Keep in mind that the latest iPhone announcement was kind of underwhelming. Aside from better cameras, larger screens and improved performance, there is not much that is a must-have. Admittedly, though, the new version of the Watch does look interesting in terms of the healthcare features (such as a full EKG).And it's true that the company has made strides in aggressively bolstering its services business, such as Apple Pay, iTunes, Apple Care, the iCloud and the App Store. In the latest quarter, the revenues came to $9.5 billion, up from $7.3 billion in the same period a year ago. These revenues are also generally recurring and sport higher margins compared to devices.But when it comes to the AAPL stock price, the main driver is still the iPhone. And yes, there are reasons to be concerned. The market for smartphones is getting saturated and it seems likely that more consumers will not be as amenable to fork over $1,000 for a new device. This is probably why the new iPhone XR starts at only $750.What's more, APPL will need to contend with some worthy alternatives. One is Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) new Pixel 3. Based on media reports, it looks like it's a winner and the device is reasonably priced at $800.This week the Chinese government announced that there was a slowing of the national economy, with the growth of GDP at 6.5% . This was actually the weakest performance since the first quarter of 2009.It does look like President's Trump's trade war is taking a toll. In fact, it seems like a good bet that the slowdown will not be temporary either, as it takes time for such policies to course through an economy. In light of all this, it should be no surprise that the Chinese equities markets have been in the bear phase this year.But this should also be worrisome for AAPL stock. According to Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) analyst Rod Hall : "There are multiple signs of rapidly slowing consumer demand in China which we believe could easily affect Apple's demand there this fall."The macro situation in China may be only just one of the factors. Note that the competitive environment in the country remains intense, with fierce operators like Huawei. Something else: With the aggressive tariffs, consumers in China may be showing their nationalism by saying "no" to Apple phones.It does not seem likely that there will be a sharp decline in Apple's business. The company's phone lineup is still solid, with a good range on the pricing. Again, the services business should provide stability and there will likely be growth with the Watch business.But the problem is that Wall Street has been factoring in robust numbers, as the price-to-earnings multiple is at 19X. During the past decade, whenever the multiple has reached this level, there has been a sell-off.So for now, it's probably a good idea to be cautious with Apple stock. Even a slight underperformance, which could come from a combination of factors like competition and the problems in China, could mean that the AAPL stock may be vulnerable to further downside.Tom Taulli is the author of  High-Profit IPO Strategies ,  All About Commodities  and  All About Short Selling . Follow him on Twitter at  @ttaulli . As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post Why Apple Stock Is Still Too Expensive appeared first on InvestorPlace .
 By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Dow slipped in choppy trading on Monday following losses in energy and financial stocks but gains in technology sectors helped limit losses and lifted the Nasdaq. Energy  stocks sank 1 percent, weighed down by lower crude oil prices and Halliburton's  warning that fourth-quarter earnings would miss estimates amid ongoing weakness in the North American hydraulic fracturing market.  Alan Lancz president, Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc, an investment advisory firm, based in Toledo, Ohio, thinks the market will be more volatile and investors will lean toward being more cautious in the near term, especially if corporate results are weaker than expected. "It's going be a cautious situation. Revenues have been a little bit disappointing, and because of that you don't have what we've had the past few earnings reporting cycles and that's that enthusiasm. People are looking at the negatives and saying that it's a situation where there are more headwinds," he said. The Dow swung between gains and losses of more than 100 points earlier in the session, highlighting the volatility in U.S. equities as they struggle to recover from a recent selloff even as the earnings season gathers steam. Finiancial  stocks  fell 1.7 percent, with the U.S. Treasury yield curve flattened to its lowest level in more than two weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 50.53 points, or 0.2 percent, to 25,393.81, the S&P 500  lost 4.97 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,762.81 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 41.99 points, or 0.56 percent, to 7,491.02. Helping the Nasdaq and limiting losses on the S&P 500 were gains in technology stocks. The beaten-down technology index  was up 1 percent. Microsoft  gained 1.4 percent and Intel, with help from a Nomura upgrade, jumped 3 percent at the start of a big week for technology earnings. Amazon  and Alphabet  also rose. Both are due to report results later this week, while Facebook  and Apple, reporting next week, gained about 1 percent. While profits of S&P 500 companies are expected to have jumped nearly 22 percent in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv data, the outlook for future growth due to concerns over trade, rising costs and other factors. Earlier in the session, a surge in China stocks and positive sentiment across Europe on Moody's decision to keep Italy's sovereign rating outlook stable helped to support stocks. But the gains petered out, with analysts saying that news from neither China nor Italy was enough for the Wall Street to hold its levels. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.32-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.19-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

  Snap Inc. SNAP  )  is set to report third-quarter 2018 results on Oct 25.    Snap Inc. Price and Consensus  Snap Inc. Price and Consensus    |      Snap Inc. Quote   Factors Likely to Influence Q3 Results    Lackluster user growth remains the primary concern for investors primarily due to intensifying competition from Instagram. The company's focus on the younger demographic poses a lot of challenges. Snap undoubtedly is quite popular among that demography but its failure to attract the older generation (above 34 year olds) has been a negative.    Notably, the company's daily active users (DAU) decreased nearly 3 million sequentially to 188 million in second-quarter 2018. North America DAU was 80 million, down 1.2% sequentially.    Management stated that the sequential decline was due to lower usage of the Snapchat application, primarily due to the redesign. The decline is a concern as it makes the platform less attractive to advertisers.    Advertising forms the mainstay of Snap's revenues. Although the company's shift to an automated or programmatic ad delivery system has increased the number of advertisers on the platform, it has resulted in lower ad prices, which is impacting its results.    Nevertheless, Snap is leaving no stone unturned to turn around its fortunes. The company has been focusing on new features like Group Video Chat (that allows users to video chat with up to 16 friends at a time) and Lens Explorer.    Moreover, the company launched Snappables, new Lenses for sharing augmented reality (AR) experiences with one or multiple friends. Users can control Snappables using touch, motion, and facial expressions.    Snap Kit was launched during the second quarter to help developers build products. The company also inked partnerships with Pandora P  and Tinder to share features on the platforms.   What Our Model Says    According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP  . The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or #5) are best avoided.    Snap has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -1.99%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.   Stocks to Consider    Here are some companies, which, per our model, have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:    Apple AAPL  has an Earnings ESP of +1.59% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.    HubSpot, Inc. HUBS  has an Earnings ESP of +57.58% and a Zacks Rank #2. Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?

  VeriSign, Inc. VRSN  is set to report third-quarter 2018 results on Oct 25.    VeriSign, Inc. Price and Consensus      VeriSign, Inc. Price and Consensus    |      VeriSign, Inc. Quote  Factors Likely to Influence Q3 Results    VeriSign holds a significant position in the highly regulated .com and .net domain industry. The company is the exclusive registrar of the .com, .net and .name domains per its agreements with The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).    The renewal of the .com contract and price hikes for the .com and .net domain names remain drivers of VeriSign's top line. Domain name registrations increased 6 million or 1.8% sequentially to 339.8 million across top-level domains (TLDs) at the end of the second quarter.    We believe that the growing need for Internet consumption globally will primarily drive domain names registered with VeriSign and thus contribute to its growth.    However, increase in marketing expenses is expected to keep margins under pressure in the to-be-reported quarter.   What Our Model Says    According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP  .

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter stocks somewhat stabilized last week, the market is just calm enough to avoid the label of a total meltdown. But the PowerShares QQQ ETF Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ ) fell about 10% in ten days, and high-quality names like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) were not spared. While GOOG stock has held up somewhat well over the past week, it's down over 8% this month.Considering that Alphabet stock had come under pressure earlier in October, this latest dip isn't pleasing to shareholders. GOOG stock is now down 15% from its highs. However, investors are getting an excellent opportunity to gobble up a few more shares of an incredibly well-run tech giant at a discount.Here are four reasons why you should buy GOOG stock on the pullback.Alphabet's core business remains incredibly robust. With its popular Android operating system and its status as the default search engine on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) devices, Google is set to remain the premiere operator of mobile search. While Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) are gobbling up more ad revenue than ever, GOOG will remain the search champion for many years to come.Moreover, Alphabet owns the top two websites in the world: Google.com and YouTube.com. Its overseas websites, such as Google.uk and Google.ca, are also extremely popular. Users stream an average of 1 billion hours  per day on YouTube. GOOG's search and video businesses are well-oiled machines, with feelers and tentacles in plenty of other businesses.Alphabet's core business is one reason to believe in GOOG stock, but the company's growth and the valuation of Alphabet stock should also make investors confident in the shares. Analysts on average expect the company to generate revenue growth of 23.5% this year and more than 19% growth in 2019. The company's earnings growth is expected to roughly match its revenue growth in 2018, while estimates call on average for 20.5% earnings growth in 2019. Given these consensus estimates, the stock's current valuation of 27.5 times this year's earnings is not unreasonable in my view, since GOOG stock is a blue-chip tech name. Furthermore, it has a defensible business and strong growth.The bright future of GOOG should also make investors upbeat on GOOG stock. Apple's iPhone will likely always beat Alphabet's Pixel phones, and Amazon will probably beat Alphabet when it comes to smart speakers. But Alphabet will stay ahead of both of them on the video and automotive fronts.YouTube is a heavyweight on its own, but YouTube TV is no slouch. I use the latter product, and I'm very happy with it. It's simple to use, works on all my devices, is way cheaper than cable and provides unlimited DVR. Signing up for and adding YouTube TV is simple, and it offers reasonably-priced TV content without forcing users to give up a great deal of sports or live content.But Google's Chromecast products and video streaming efforts can be greatly improved. If the company, which already partners with Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU ) on its voice assistant, works with Roku in other areas in the future, it could quickly enter and dominate other video and streaming markets.In the automotive world, Alphabet's self-driving segment, Waymo, is reportedly still on track to launch its commercial service later this year in Arizona. Some analysts have valued this segment at up to $180 billion , but many others have pegged its value at more than $120 billion. Even for Alphabet and its $760 billion market cap, that's a sizable figure.Meanwhile, there are reports that Google is gearing up to enter China. That move could pay dividends. Although China won't move the needle for GOOG this quarter or even next year, down the road it could be an important segment for the company. Time will tell whether the China business will pan out, but it's something investors are surely watching. Please don't forget about the company's push into the smart home segment or its massive cloud opportunity.Given my upbeat view of Google's businesses, I am long GOOG stock. The combination of growth, value and potential offered by GOOG is simply too enticing. As much as I'd like for the 60-week moving trend to prop up Alphabet stock, I'd love to nibble at the stock down near $1,000. Not only is there level support in that area, but the backside of a prior downtrend line would come into play. Plus, the 100-week moving average should give some support. to Alphabet stockSo what should investors do? Long-term investors could initiate a small position in GOOG stock near current levels, with uptrend support nearby. If Alphabet stock drops, look to buy more shares near $1,000.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell .

 Every iPhone that   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) sells is packed with a wide range of sophisticated   components. At the heart of each of those devices is an   Apple-designed applications processor.While Apple designs those applications processors, it doesn't   manufacture them, relying on third parties to build them.   Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company    (NYSE: TSM) is believed to be the sole manufacturer of the   applications processors found in all of Apple's currently   available iPhones (iPhone 7, iPhone 8,   iPhone XR    , iPhone XS, and   iPhone XS Max    ).  Image source: Apple.TSMC recently reported its earnings results and hosted a   conference call to go over the results and field questions from   analysts. Here are three things that I took away from the   earnings call.TSMC co-CEO C.C. Wei said that during the second half of 2018,   TSMC's "business will be strongly supported by the 7-nanometer   ramp-up, which is mainly driven by a few new smartphone   launches."For some context: Apple's recently announced iPhone XS, iPhone   XS Max, and iPhone XR are powered by the   A12 Bionic chip    , which is manufactured using TSMC's 7-nanometer technology.   Huawei, too, announced its Mate 20 family of smartphones powered   by its own homegrown Kirin 980 applications processor, which is   also manufactured using TSMC's 7-nanometer technology.With that said, Wei did lower the company's full-year 2018   revenue growth expectations from a prior range of 7% to 9% to   just 6.5% thanks to "further weakening of cryptocurrency mining   demand." TSMC had, during its July earnings call, taken its   full-year revenue growth projection down from "about 10%" to a   range of 7% to 9%.Chip manufacturing is a capital intensive process, and as a   result, companies like TSMC spend billions of dollars per year in   capital expenditures.According to CFO Lora Ho, the company is set to spend between   $10 billion and $10.5 billion on capital expenditures this year.   Ho also said that "[going] forward, we expect annual [capital   expenditures] needed to support our 5% to 10% revenue [compound   annual growth rate] in U.S. dollar terms in the next few years   will continue to range between $10 billion and $12 billion."TSMC routinely updates investors on the progress it's making   in developing future chip manufacturing technologies. TSMC builds   a wide range of technologies for everything from cutting-edge   applications like mobile applications processors for premium   smartphones to applications that don't require the latest and   greatest.Here, I'd like to focus on what TSMC had to say about its most   advanced technologies.Wei highlighted that the company's 7-nanometer technology is   in production today and is "available for all product innovations   at the same time." TSMC's website says that it's "launching two   separate 7nm FinFET tracks: one optimized for mobile   applications, the other for high performance computing   applications."All in all, between the company's current 7-nanometer   technology as well as an enhanced version of the technology,   called 7-nanometer+, Wei said that the company will "see more   than 100 customer product      tape-outs    by the end of 2019."Speaking of 7-nanometer+, Wei told investors that this   technology "is in risk production now" and offers between "15%   and 20% better density and more than 10% lower power consumption"   relative to the first-generation 7-nanometer technology. "[We]   are working with many customers for their second wave product   designs in N7+," Wei said.The executive also talked about the technology that will   follow 7-nanometer+, called 5-nanometer (or N5). "Our N5   technology development is on schedule," Wei asserted. He   explained that "compared to N7, TSMC's N5 deliver[s] 1.8x to   1.86x logic area reduction and close to 15% to 18% speed gain" on   an ARM Cortex A72 processor core."We expect to receive first customer product tape-out[s] in   [the] spring of 2019, followed by production ramp in the first   half of 2020," Wei said.  10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor     Manufacturing       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

 By Amy Caren Daniel Oct 22 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped in volatile trading on Monday as a boost from news in China and Italy faded and losses in energy and financial stocks weighed, but gains in technology stocks helped limit losses and lifted the Nasdaq. The Dow swung between gains and losses of more than 100 points, highlighting the choppiness in U.S. equities as they struggle to recover from a recent selloff even as the earnings season gathers steam. But the gains petered out after the open, with analysts saying that news from neither China nor Italy was enough for the Wall Street to hold its levels. What was helping the market was a 1.09 percent jump in beaten-down technology stocks. The sector has lost about 6 percent so far in October, already its worst month in six years, lowering valuations of high-growth stocks. Microsoft  gained 1.2 percent and Intel, with help from a Nomura upgrade, jumped 1.8 percent at the start of a big week for technology earnings. Amazon  rose 1.3 percent and Alphabet  gained 0.7 percent. Both are due to report results later this week, while Facebook  and Apple, reporting next week, gained about 1 percent. "Investors are looking for opportunities to buy right now. They are taking advantage of the recent sell-off to buy high-growth stocks," said Jeff Carbone, managing partner for Cornerstone Wealth, in Charlotte, North Carolina. While profits of S&P 500 companies are expected to have jumped nearly 22 percent in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv data, the outlook for future growth due to concerns over trade, rising costs and other factors. Energy  stocks sank 1.38 percent, weighed down by lower crude oil prices and Halliburton's warning that fourth-quarter earnings would miss estimates amid ongoing weakness in the North American hydraulic fracturing market.  Halliburton  and rival oilfield services provider Schlumberger, both fell 3.2 percent. At 13:36 p.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was down 115.27 points, or 0.45 percent, at 25,329.07, the S&P 500  was down 8.52 points, or 0.31 percent, at 2,759.26 and the Nasdaq Composite  was up 31.49 points, or 0.42 percent, at 7,480.51. Finiancial  stocks  fell 1.37 percent as the U.S. Treasury yield curve flattened to its lowest level in more than two weeks ahead of new debt auctions.  Health stocks  slid 0.85 percent, largely as cancer drug makers posted unimpressive trial data at an industry conference. Bristol-Myers  fell 5.8 percent on a delay to a regulatory approval for its cancer therapy. Hasbro  dropped 3.6 percent after its quarterly results missed estimates as the demise of major retail partner Toys 'R' Us hurt sales.  Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.40-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.21-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P recorded four new 52-week highs and 46 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 14 new highs and 223 new lows.

They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.But, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market.Non-cap weighted indexes try to choose stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, which is based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a mix of other such characteristics.The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.Fund Sponsor & IndexBecause the fund has amassed over $220.52 M, this makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs. FDVV is managed by Fidelity. Before fees and expenses, FDVV seeks to match the performance of the Fidelity Core Dividend Index.The Fidelity Core Dividend Index is designed to reflect the performance of stocks of large and mid-capitalization dividend-paying companies that are expected to continue to pay and grow their dividends.Cost & Other ExpensesSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.29% for this ETF, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 3.86%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.When you look at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 4.15% of the fund's total assets, followed by Verizon Communications Inc (VZ) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT).The top 10 holdings account for about 29.25% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskYear-to-date, the Fidelity High Dividend ETF has added roughly 6.86% so far, and is up about 12.33% over the last 12 months (as of 10/22/2018). FDVV has traded between $27.36 and $31.10 in this past 52-week period.The fund has a beta of 0.83 and standard deviation of 10.00% for the trailing three-year period. With about 111 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesFidelity High Dividend ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.Invesco High Yield Equity Dividend Achievers ETF (PEY) tracks NASDAQ US Dividend Achievers 50 Index and the iShares Core S&P U.S. Value ETF (IUSV) tracks S&P 900 Value Index. Invesco High Yield Equity Dividend Achievers ETF has $771.63 M in assets, iShares Core S&P U.S. Value ETF has $4.52 B. PEY has an expense ratio of 0.54% and IUSV charges 0.04%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center .

Super Micro Denies Malicious Chips Report, To Conduct Further Review Of Hardware
 Although   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) sells a wide range of products, analysts,   investors, and the media seem to focus heavily on just one of the   company's product lines: the iPhone. And there's good reason for   that. In this article I'll go over why the iPhone business is so   critical to Apple and discuss some of the basics that current and   potential investors in    Apple stock    need to know about it.During Apple's fiscal year 2017, which ended in September of   that year, the company raked in about $229.2 billion in revenue.   Of that, roughly $141.3 billion -- or more than 61.6% -- came   from iPhone sales. While that percentage was down modestly from   the 63.3% that the iPhone made up in the company's prior fiscal   year, it's clear that Apple's business practically lives and dies   by the performance of its iPhone business.  Apple executives Jony Ive and Tim Cook looking at iPhone XR     devices. Image source: Apple.What's even more interesting is that Apple's iPhone business   has been doing phenomenally well during fiscal year 2018, with   sales up 15% year over year through the first three quarters of   that year. Now, since Apple's sales over that period also grew by   about 15% year over year, iPhone revenue as a percentage of the   total during that time was only up marginally, at 63.9% of sales   during that time against almost 63.7% of sales during the same   period of fiscal year 2017.The key, though, is that, at least through the first three   quarters of fiscal year 2018, Apple didn't become   less    dependent on the iPhone -- the iPhone delivered robust enough   growth that the company's dependence on the business was   practically unchanged.Each quarter, Apple reports two important metrics around the   iPhone. The first is the total revenue that the company generated   from the product line; the second is total units shipped. From   those two metrics, investors can derive a third important metric   -- average selling prices.When the smartphone market was on a fast growth trajectory,   Apple could rely heavily on unit-shipment growth to deliver   strong revenue and profit growth. For some perspective, Apple   enjoyed 73% iPhone unit-shipment growth during its fiscal year   2012, and then enjoyed an additional 20% iPhone unit-shipment   growth in its fiscal year 2013. Interestingly, iPhone revenue   grew by 71% and 16%, respectively, during those years, implying   average-selling-price contraction.In recent years, though, Apple has struggled to grow iPhone   unit shipments. After a monster year of iPhone unit growth during   its fiscal year 2015, thanks to the so-called "super cycle" that   the launch of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus triggered (units   were up 37% and revenue was up 52%), Apple saw unit shipments   decline 8% in fiscal year 2016 before inching up 2% in fiscal   year 2017.What's interesting is that over the course of fiscal year   2018, Apple hasn't been able to deliver real iPhone unit-shipment   growth. iPhone unit shipments were only up by around 754,000   units (practically flat year over year) during the first three   quarters of the year. iPhone revenue, on the other hand, was up a   whopping 15% during that time. This means that basically all   of the iPhone revenue growth that Apple experienced through the   first three quarters of fiscal year 2018 was due to an increase   in average selling prices.It'll be interesting to see how both iPhone unit shipments and   average selling prices trend over the course of fiscal year 2019   -- and beyond.  10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Super Micro to review hardware for malicious chips
 By Sonam Rai Oct 22 (Reuters) - Computer hardware maker Super Micro Computer Inc  said on Monday it would review its motherboards for any proof of malicious chips as alleged in a recent media report. "Despite the lack of any proof that a malicious hardware chip exists, we are undertaking a complicated and time-consuming review to further address the article," the server and storage manufacturer said in a letter to its customers, dated Oct. 18. A Bloomberg report on Oct. 4 cited 17 unidentified sources from intelligence agencies and businesses that claimed Chinese spies had placed computer chips inside equipment used by about 30 companies, including Apple Inc  and Amazon.com Inc  and multiple U.S. government agencies, which would give Beijing secret access to internal networks. Super Micro denied the allegations made in the report.  The company said the design complexity makes it practically impossible to insert a functional, unauthorized component onto a motherboard without it being caught by the checks in its manufacturing and assembly process. It is entirely plausible that a malicious chip can be placed on a motherboard but it will be at a very high cost, and the risk of detection increases with every such chip in the field, said Jake Williams, a former National Security Agency analyst and founder of the cyber security firm Rendition Infosec. "This technique would only be used for high value targets that couldn't be easily compromised via another attack vector," Williams said. The Bloomberg report also said Apple in 2015 had found malicious chips on Super Micro motherboards and added that Amazon uncovered such chips the same year while examining servers made by Elemental Technologies, which Amazon eventually acquired. Both Apple and Amazon have denied the allegations. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook told online news website BuzzFeed on Friday that Bloomberg should retract the story.  Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy also joined Cook in asking Bloomberg to retract the report. "Bloombergstory is wrong about Amazon, too ... Reporters got played or took liberties. Bloomberg should retract," Jassy said in a on Monday. Bloomberg had previously said it stood by its report and was confident of its reporting, which was conducted for more than a year. Security experts as well as the U.S. and U.K. authorities have said they had no knowledge of the attacks. 
 
 TAIPEI, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Taiwan's export orders expanded slightly less than expected in September, as weaker demand for machinery amid the United States-China trade war partly offset robust orders for electronic gadgets for the year-end holiday season. Orders for trade-dependent Taiwan, which have seen steady single-digit growth since a small dip in June, rose 4.2 percent in September from a year earlier to $47.86 billion, a record for that month, Ministry of Economic Affairs data showed on Monday. The data "shows that the impact of the U.S.-Sino trade war has gradually surfaced," said Carl Liu, an analyst at KGI Securities. Orders for telecommunication products reached a record in September "mostly due to new smartphone and wearable device launches from international vendors," the ministry said in a  statement. "Although traditional orders were affected by the Sino-U.S. trade frictions, the full-year order could still reach over $500 billion," ministry official Lin Li-chen told reporters, referring to orders from sectors including metal products and machinery. The ministry said machinery orders suffered the first month-on-month decline since August 2016 as companies in China were "turning cautious" as the trade dispute escalated. 
 GROWTH IN Q4? Liu of KGI Securities said machinery and optics were among the worst affected by the dispute, adding that Taiwan's total exports in the fourth quarter might not increase from July-September and might even contract. A Reuters poll had forecast 5.0 percent growth in September orders, while the government projected 5.0-7.1 percent. Taiwan's export orders are a leading indicator of demand for Asia's hi-tech gadgets and other shipments, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months. The government forecast an annual increase of 3.0-5.1 percent in October. Orders from the United States, rose 3.7 percent in September from a year earlier. In August, they rose 14.9 percent. Those from China increased 1.3 percent , compared with rising 7.3 percent the previous month. Orders from the European Union rose 13 percent and for Japan fell 8 percent. Taiwan's central bank last month revised its economic growth forecast for this year to 2.73 percent from June's projection of 2.68 percent, and said it would maintain appropriate loose monetary policy to support growth. It forecast expansion to slow to 2.48 percent next year.  
 
 In a recent column, I argued that   Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL) ability to develop its own chips is a "   huge asset    ." The two key reasons I cited were the fact that Apple can build   chips that allow it to differentiate its products from the pack,   as well as the ability to more easily introduce new product   categories.We've seen Apple's chip efforts at work across its current   product lines, and the   results have been good    . In the coming years, Apple may bring its chip chops to bear as   it tries to build its rumored Apple Car, according to analyst   Ming-Chi Kuo with TF International Securities. Per the analyst,   this could benefit key Apple supplier   Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company    (NYSE: TSM) .  Image source: Apple.Let's take a closer look at what Kuo (via   MacRumors    ) had to say.Here's Kuo:We believe that Apple Car's Advanced Driver Assistance     Systems (ADAS) will support either Level 4 (high automation) or     Level 5 (full automation). Only TSMC's 3/     5 nm      process can meet Level 4 and Level 5 chip requirements.In order for Apple to build its own self-driving car, it will   need to either buy processors from others to handle the immense   amount of computational power that's needed or build its own.   From what Kuo writes, it seems that Apple is going to design its   own chips -- as it does for almost all of its other product   lines.While Apple has substantial in-house chip development chops,   it doesn't manufacture its own chips. Instead, it relies on third   parties to do that, as chip manufacturing is both research and   development-intensive and capital-intensive. TSMC's opportunity   would be its ability to profit from manufacturing those chips on   Apple's behalf.It's important to keep in mind that at this point, trying to   size the Apple Car opportunity for either Apple or TSMC is little   more than a shot in the dark -- we simply don't have enough   information to make predictions that have a prayer of being   accurate. Nevertheless, if Apple does release its own   self-driving car someday and it contains Apple-designed,   TSMC-built silicon, TSMC would stand to profit.Whether or not Apple ultimately brings its own self-driving   car to market, the key thing to keep in mind is the fact that   Apple has an exceptional internal chip development organization,   which makes it entirely feasible for the company to roll out its   own self-driving car chips -- if it wants to, that is.Another thing to keep in mind is that a hypothetical Apple   self-driving car chip could very well leverage many of the key   technologies that the company already develops for its other   product lines, such as the iPhone and iPad.Take, for example,   NVIDIA    's   Xavier chip    , which is also targeted at autonomous vehicles. The chip   incorporates    CPU cores, a GPU, an image signal processor, a video processor,   and a "programmable vision accelerator."Apple's A-series chips already incorporate many of those same   basic technologies. It should be a relatively straightforward   exercise for Apple to integrate those technologies -- albeit in   different proportions suitable for the needs of future   self-driving cars -- alongside any specialized technologies to   support its ambition to build a capable self-driving car   chip.  10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

 Music has always been a big business for   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) . In creating iTunes and the iPod in the early   2000s, Apple was doing more than making a gadget -- it became the   guardian of consumers' prized music collections. The iPod wasn't   the first portable MP3 player, but it provided a superior user   experience with its trademark white color and circular navigation   wheel. Apple integrated the iPod tightly with iTunes and its   macOS software, creating a music ecosystem.Music remained important at Apple with the 2014 acquisition of   Beats Electronics, a headphone company, which brought with it   music talent Dr. Dre and hit-making record producer Jimmy Iovine.   At that time, Iovine praised Apple's "unmatched ability to marry   culture and technology."  Image source: Getty Images.That acquisition also included the Beats streaming music   service, which became Apple Music, making Apple a force in   streaming. Apple Music now boasts over 50 million subscribers. At   the time, Apple was again a late entrant behind first-mover   Spotify    (NYSE: SPOT) . But Apple has been gaining on Spotify recently,   nearly matching    Spotify's subscriber count in the U.S.The next potential phase of the music-tech industry tie-up   involves a challenge to the big record labels. To that end, Apple   just made another hire through an acquisition (though a much   smaller one than Beats), bringing on the founders of a start-up   called Asaii to help bolster its new publishing venture.To understand the Asaii acquisition, one has to understand why   and how Spotify and Apple are getting into publishing. Last year,   Spotify quietly began signing small, independent artists to   direct licensing deals. The move essentially cuts out the   all-powerful triumvirate of labels in the music industry:   Universal,   Sony    , and Warner Music. Though the dollars are small at this stage,   it could mark the beginning of something bigger. Right now,   Spotify is going after artists not yet on a label, including   up-and-coming unknowns and older artists who have regained rights   to their music.This is not unlike the strategy   Netflix     used in its initial growth phase. When Netflix had   distribution but no content of its own, it licensed older shows,   signed "older" talent such as Adam Sandler, and then eventually   created its own shows. By methodically growing content, Netflix   eventually disrupted many studios and cable channels.The similarities between Spotify/Apple and Netflix involve   distribution and data. With huge scale, these platforms can   collect and analyze huge reams of data. Netflix took that data   and used it to create massively successful shows. Can Spotify   (and now Apple) use data to sign artists who might have gone   overlooked by major labels?In May, Apple was reported to have created an internal music   publishing division, following Spotify's efforts. The project is   said to have been one of the first initiatives of new Apple Music   director Oliver Schusser, who   took over in April    after Iovine left the company. That music-publishing division, to   be headed by iTunes legal director Elena Segal, was reported   to be aimed more at songwriters than artists.And Apple has now made another move, paying up for the talents   of Asaii founders Sony Theakanath, Austin Chen, and Chris Zhang.   Since it's likely these three might perform functions at Apple   that are similar to what they did before, Asaii's services could   give a glimpse into Apple's musical ambitions.Asaii was founded as an AI-powered company to enable music   labels to find the next big artist. By analyzing data from   multiple platforms (not just Apple or Spotify), Asaii touted its   almost superhuman capabilities in artists and repertoire, the   part of music publishing dedicated to discovering and developing   new talent.One snippet from its      website    says: "Artists recommended that are on this page are guaranteed   to hit a chart within 10 weeks to a year. Our algorithms are able   to find the next Justin Bieber, before anyone else." Whether you   like Justin Bieber or not, you can't argue with sales, so this   kind of software, if it works as advertised, could be a big   deal.Apparently, Apple thinks there's something here. Details of   the acquisition weren't given, only that the price was "less than   $100 million." Quite pricey for three employees!Both artists and distributors curiously don't make much profit   from music sales. As such, both ends are looking to take back   some of the pie from the oligopoly of the major labels. Apple's   new acquisition (with the Asaii founders who come with it) shows   it's joining Spotify in those efforts, with a helping hand from   big data and artificial intelligence. This data-driven disruption   is going on in just about every industry, and the story still   appears to be in the very early chapters for music. So don't   touch that dial -- there's more to come!  10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

3 Warren Buffett Stocks Worth Buying Now
 Known as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett has collected   both an incredible investment record and a deservedly vast   following among investors of all types. Every move he makes is   scrutinized in the hope of gleaning  wisdom from his   investment choices. Here are three Buffett stocks that are worth   digging into right now, each of which clearly highlights this   investment legend's long-term approach to investing:   Walmart, Inc.    (NYSE: WMT) ,   Apple, Inc.    (NASDAQ: AAPL) , and   Seritage Growth Properties    (NYSE: SRG) .  Brian Stoffel    (Walmart, Inc.):    Admittedly, my investment style doesn't map perfectly with Warren   Buffett's. While he focuses primarily on non-technology companies   with pricing power, I like those that benefit from either high   switching costs or   network effects    .  Image source: Getty Images.One stock we both like, however, is Walmart. Buffett's   Berkshire Hathaway    (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) currently owns 1.4 million   shares of Walmart, worth about $134 million. While I don't own   shares myself, I've given the company an outperform rating on   my Motley Fool CAPS profile    , a move I made in May.But it hasn't always been this way. Back in 2016, when the   company made the $3 billion purchase of Jet.com, I   called it     a desperate and foolhardy move. There's no way Walmart   could ever catch   Amazon    , I reasoned.Thus far, I've been proven very wrong. While still not an   existential threat to Amazon, Walmart's e-commerce performance   has been   impressive    . U.S. e-commerce sales grew 44% last year and another 40%   during the most recent quarter. It turns out Jet.com's Marc Lore,   who came over with the acquisition, has made a major difference   at the company. Walmart's   shrewd decision    to invest in India's Flipkart only adds to my belief that Walmart   is setting itself up to be a market beater.Walmart is currently trading for just 16 times trailing free   cash flow  and offering a 2.2% dividend yield to investors.   I think now is as good a time as any to consider an investment in   Walmart.  Keith Speights     (Apple, Inc.)    : Warren Buffett was kind of late to the party with Apple. But   the consumer technology stock has become Berkshire Hathaway's   biggest holding. It's also   the top holding in my personal portfolio.     Between the two of us, we own close to $47 billion of    Apple stock    . Granted, Buffett's stake (via Berkshire) is just a wee bit   higher than mine.There are several reasons why Apple still is a stock worth   buying. For one thing, Apple's moat is both compelling and   enduring, thanks to its ecosystem of products. For example, if   you use an iPad, you're likely to use an iPhone, as well. And   you're likely to shop on the Apple App Store.We could also talk at length about Apple's fantastic financial   position. The company has a cash stockpile of nearly $71 billion.   It continues to generate cash flow like crazy. Apple even claims   a much-overlooked dividend that currently yields a not-too-shabby   1.3%.But the biggest reason, in my view, to like Apple is what   could be coming around the corner for the company. Apple is on   track to invest more than $14 billion this year in research and   development (R&D). It's pouring an undisclosed but almost   certainly significant amount of this R&D money   into augmented reality (AR)    . I think that AR could be a game changer for Apple within a few   years.  Reuben Gregg Brewer    (Seritage Growth Properties):    Seritage is a   real estate investment trust, or REIT    , created by struggling   Sears Holdings     to raise cash. It was heavily dependent on Sears and Kmart   stores for its revenues when it first came to market in 2015 --   Buffett bought shares for his personal account late that same   year. However, as of the second quarter, those two stores   accounted for just 44% of rents. Seritage has made a lot of   progress in its shift away from Sears, and that's a good   thing.    Sears Holdings Revenues as a Percent               of Seritage's Total Revenues Date9/15*6/166/176/18Percentage78%71%56%44%Data source: Seritage Growth Properties company   filings. *First full quarter as a public company.     Sears and Kmart stores are paying around $4 per square foot in   rent to Seritage, while new tenants are paying market rents,   which are closer to $14.The ideal outcome for Seritage would be a continuation of the   slow and steady shift away from Sears Holdings' troubled brands,   but that process might get sped up now that Sears Holdings has   filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.      While the closing of Sears stores could leave Seritage with a lot   of empty space, here's the interesting thing: Seritage inked a   deal with Berkshire Hathaway in July that will allow the REIT to   access up to $2 billion in cash. So even if Sears goes belly up,   Seritage should have enough cash to keep moving forward.If you can stomach some near-term uncertainty, the business   opportunity here appears pretty enticing -- enticing enough, as   it were, to attract the Oracle of Omaha.  10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

 By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The pressure is on for Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft as they prepare to report quarterly results at a time when confidence in those market leaders looks increasingly fragile and in danger of derailing Wall Street's rally. After worries about higher interest rates sparked a steep sell-off in early October and again on Thursday, the S&P 500 remains down 5 percent from its Sept. 20 record high close, with top-shelf stocks including Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc, Netflix Inc  and Facebook Inc  showing little of their vitality from recent years. "The equity market is at a critical point here," said Kurt Brunner, portfolio manager, Swarthmore Group in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. "In order for it not to get a lot worse, I think you need to see Amazon and Alphabet put up some good numbers." With investors worried about increased internet regulation and criticism of Facebook's handling of user data, the social media company's stock has slumped 29 percent from its record high on July 25. Alphabet is 15 percent below its July 26 record high close, while Amazon has fallen 12 percent this month. Microsoft has also stalled after doubling over the past two years. Still, Netflix and Amazon remain up 81 percent and 51 percent year to date, respectively, underscoring their places among Wall Street's crème de la crème. The S&P 500's largest component, Apple Inc  has gained 28 percent in 2018, even after falling 7 percent from its record high on Oct. 3. A 5 percent surge in Netflix on Wednesday after its upbeat quarterly report allayed fears the video streaming company was losing steam.  But that did little to perk up its fellow stocks in the so-called FANG group that also includes Amazon, Google-parent Alphabet and Facebook. In the past, those stocks have often risen together.  Powerful rallies by Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft and Netflix in recent years have made them must-own stocks for portfolio managers, making their ownership so widespread that they are at risk of a major sell-off should a majority of investors' views about them change for the worse. "So many funds are invested in the same stocks. They got less crowded in the past week, but at this point it's difficult to say if we are going to shrug everything off and go to new highs a month from now, or if we're going to test more lows," warned Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas. The recent slide has left Amazon and Facebook trading at discounted multiples of their expected earnings. Amazon's forward price-to-earnings ratio last week touched 74, a seven-year low, according to Refinitiv data. Facebook this month traded as little as 18 times expected earnings, the lowest since its 2012 public listing. 
 ROBUST EARNINGS GROWTH Helped by a strong economy and deep corporate tax cuts, S&P 500 earnings per share are expected to grow 22 percent in the third quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. But some investors are already eyeing slower growth in 2019, when the corporate tax cut benefits will be a year old and no longer create an extra boost. Investors are also nervous about potential fallout from U.S. President Donald Trump's trade conflict with Beijing, and higher interest rates as the strong U.S. economy and low unemployment pressure prices. Propelled by its cloud computing business, Amazon is expected by analysts to report a September-quarter non-GAAP net profit of $1.54 billion, or $3.12 per share, compared to just $256 million a year ago, according to Refinitiv. Alphabet's September-quarter non-GAAP net profit is seen rising 9 percent to $7.36 billion, or $10.43 per share. Microsoft's non-GAAP net income is seen rising 13 percent to $7.46 billion, or 96 cents per share. Facebook reports its quarterly results on Oct. 30, followed on Nov. 1 by Apple. Amazon and Alphabet are widely considered technology companies. However, within S&P Dow Jones Indices' Global Industry Classification Standard, Amazon falls into the consumer discretionary sector and Alphabet belongs to the recently renamed communication services sector.  
 
 
 Fresh off its   $1 trillion market cap    ,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) held its annual product reveal last month. The   company   released a new flagship iPhone    -- the XS (read 10 S) -- as well as a larger version of its   top-of-the-line model, the XS Max. The devices had a number of   pricing options starting at $999 and climbing as high as $1,449,   depending on the model and amount of memory chosen.One of the more surprising revelations from the event was the   introduction of the iPhone XR. The lower-cost device contains a   surprisingly robust set of features and carries a price tag 25%   lower than the XS model. Many have noted that the XR could   potentially   cannibalize sales    of the higher-priced models as consumers look for more   cost-effective iPhone options from Apple.Now, a renowned Apple follower is signaling that demand for   the device could be   much    better than initially expected.  Apple executive Phil Schiller debuts the iPhone XR. Image     source: Apple.Noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, with TF International Securities,   is known for his impressive track record regarding Apple product   predictions. His insight into the company is the result of his   close industry relationships and strong ties with many of the   companies in Apple's supply chain.Earlier this week, Kuo increased his estimates for the   calendar fourth quarter (which is Apple's fiscal first   quarter). The analyst now believes iPhone shipments will top   out between 78 million and 83 million, up from a prior estimate   of 75 million to 80 million. This would result in an   increase of 4% at the midpoint compared to the   77.3 million iPhones Apple sold    in the prior-year quarter.What's driving this newfound enthusiasm for iPhone shipments?   Apple's low-cost option, the iPhone XR.Kuo believes that Apple will ship between 36 million and 38   million units of the XR, a 10% increase from his previous   estimate of 33 million to 35 million units. These higher   shipments will be the result of not only strong replacement   demand, but also an improved supply, which was expected to ramp   up in early October.The noted Apple-watcher says the "larger display, longer   battery life, dual SIM-support, and new form factor design," will   lead to increased demand for the XR, especially in light of its   lower cost. With a starting price of $749 for the XR -- compared   to a base cost of $999 for the XS -- Kuo is forecasting a more   robust product cycle for Apple than occurred with the iPhone 8   and 8 Plus last year.That isn't all. Kuo is forecasting overall shipments in the   first three months of 2019 (Apple's fiscal second quarter) will   "beat low seasonality" and grow 10% year over year to a range of   55 million to 60 million devices, driven by increasing demand for   the XR. This would represent an increase of between 5% and 15%   compared to the 52.2 million iPhones Apple sold during the same   period last year.  Apple CEO Tim Cook and design chief Jony Ive check out the     iPhone XR. Image source: Apple.For consumers on a budget, the iPhone XR represents a viable   alternative to more pricey options and offers a reasonable   compromise on features. The device contains a more affordable LCD   display compared to the top-of-the-line OLED on the XS, and the   XR hasn't been outfitted with Apple's latest dual-camera   technology. The device does have the A12 bionic chip, Face ID,   and an edge-to-edge screen boasted by more expensive models.It's also worth noting that Apple will probably see the   average selling price (ASP) grow from the record-setting $796 and   $728 Apple achieved in the fiscal first and second quarter of   2018, respectively. With iPhone prices topping out at $1,449 and   heavy demand expected for the $749 XR, expect the company to   achieve a new high watermark for ASP, as well as new sales   records in the quarters to come.  10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

 On Sept. 12,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) announced three new iPhones: the   iPhone XR    , iPhone XS, and   iPhone XS Max    . The iPhone XS was essentially an upgrade of last year's iPhone   X, and the iPhone XS Max is a much bigger version of the XS   (representing a new screen size from Apple). The iPhone XR is a   lower-cost alternative to the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, with a   screen size that's in between the two.We'll get a sense of how well Apple is expecting these phones   to sell when the company provides its financial guidance for the   first quarter of its fiscal year 2019 on Nov. 1.  Image source: Apple.According to a recent report from TF International Securities   analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple's 2019 iPhone lineup is again   expected to consist of three devices. And all three are expected   to sport the same screen sizes and screen types (OLED for the   XS/XS Max successors, LCD for the XR successor) as the current   models.This means that next year's iPhones could look quite similar   to this year's lineup. This wouldn't be the first time that Apple   tried to get a lot of mileage out of the same basic form factor   -- the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, iPhone 7, and iPhone 8 families of   devices all sported the same basic shapes and screen sizes. The   key changes in between generations were in the specifications and   features of the devices.If Kuo is right (as he often is), Apple will need to   differentiate next year's iPhones on capabilities and not form   factor. Here are some ways the company can do it.With each new iPhone generation, Apple generally makes   improvements across a number of vectors. For example, compared   with last year's iPhone X, Apple says the iPhone XS has a faster   processor,   gigabit-class LTE    , a better rear-facing camera, dual SIM support, zippier wireless   charging, and enhanced water resistance. But the iPhone X and the   iPhone XS -- save for the new gold finish on the iPhone XS --   look virtually identical.So with next year's iPhone models, I'd expect, at a minimum,   improvements along these lines: another jump in processor   performance with the A13 chip, even faster LTE, and another leap   in camera capabilities (through a combination of sensor,   software, and chip upgrades). Given how important camera quality   and features are in the fiercely-competitive premium smartphone   market, I hope to see Apple continue to make significant strides   on that front.Judging by recent history, Apple tends to introduce noticeable   display-feature updates with every other generation of iPhones.   For example, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus introduced new   displays, which were then recycled in the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s   Plus. Then, with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, Apple upgraded   the screens to support the wider DCI-P3 color space. Reviews of   the devices showed that color accuracy had improved dramatically   from the screens found on the iPhone 6 series and iPhone 6s   series.I wouldn't be surprised, then, to see Apple deliver a   significant display upgrade with the successors to the iPhone XS   and iPhone XS Max. I've   previously written    about how I'd like to see Apple deliver higher-refresh-rate   screens to its premium iPhones, which would certainly qualify as   a significant display-feature upgrade in my book.There have also been rumors that Apple is looking for ways to   reduce the size of the so-called "notch"    on the front of the device. If Apple were to figure out how to do   that without sacrificing functionality, it could be viewed as an   attractive aesthetic improvement over the current iPhones.  10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The company's strategy to acquire on a global basis in the high-growth segments that have complementary capabilities from a product, customer and/or geographic standpoint bodes well.    The acquisitions of All Sensors and Ardent Concepts (in second-quarter) also expand sensor Interconnect Products & Assemblies segment offerings, respectively.    However, for third quarter 2018, management expects sales to be lower due to seasonality.

 By Stephen Nellis Oct 19 (Reuters) - Apple Inc  Chief Executive Tim Cook on Friday told an online news website that Bloomberg should retract a story that claimed Apple's internal computer systems had been infiltrated by malicious computer chips inserted by Chinese intelligence agents. Bloomberg said it stood by its report, published earlier this month. Apple confirmed the accuracy of the BuzzFeed News report to Reuters but declined to comment further. Cook's comments follow a denial by Apple that Bloomberg included in its story, a statement posted on Apple's own website, and a letter to U.S. lawmakers. Apple declined to say whether it planned to take legal action against Bloomberg. In response to questions from Reuters about Cook's request for a retraction in the BuzzFeed News story on Friday, Bloomberg reiterated that it was confident of its reporting, conducted over more than a year. The news agency said that 17 sources confirmed "the manipulation of hardware and other elements of the attacks." Bloomberg had reported that a unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army infiltrated the supply chain of computer hardware maker Super Micro Computer Inc  to plant malicious chips that could be used to steal corporate and government secrets. Bloomberg said in its report that some 30 companies and multiple U.S. government agencies were targeted by the chips, which would give Beijing secret access to internal networks. Super Micro also has denied the report. 
 
  (RTTNews.com) - Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) Chief Executive Tim Cook has called for Bloomberg to retract a story alleging Chinese spy planted malicious chips on its servers. In an interview with Buzzfeed News, "They need to do that right thing and retract it." However, Bloomberg Businessweek said the news agency continues to back its claims and denied any chance of retraction. "Bloomberg Businessweek's investigation is the result of more than a year of reporting, during which we conducted more than 100 interviews," the publication said in a statement. "Seventeen individual sources, including government officials and insiders at the companies, confirmed the manipulation of hardware and other elements of the attacks. We also published three companies' full statements, as well as a statement from China'sMinistry of Foreign Affairs. We stand by our story and are confident in our reporting and sources." Bloomberg Businessweek earlier this month reported that Apple found "malicious chips" in its servers in 2015. According to the report, the data center hardware used by Apple and Amazon Web Services, which was supplied by server company Super Micro, was under surveillance by the Chinese government. However, Apple had denied those claims. Apple said it never found malicious chips, "hardware manipulations" or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server. The iPhone maker said that over the course of the past year, Bloomberg had contacted the company multiple times with claims of an alleged security incident at Apple. However, each time the company conducted rigorous internal investigations based on their inquiries and each time found absolutely no evidence to support any of them. "We turned the company upside down," Mr Cook told Buzzfeed. "Email searches, data centre records, financial records, shipment records. We really forensically whipped through the company to dig very deep and each time we came back to the same conclusion: This did not happen. There's no truth to this."

For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL -October 19, 2018 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet Inc.GOOGL , AppleAAPL , AmazonAMZN and FacebookFB .Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst Blog:Examining Google (GOOGL) Ahead of Q3 EarningsShares of Alphabet Inc. have slipped roughly 9% over the past three months as investors worry that more government intervention could be headed Google's way. With that said, Google's parent company looks poised to post strong top and bottom line Q3 growth, while it expands its products push.Recent NewsGoogle recently launched its next-generation Pixel smartphones. The new Pixel 3 and the Pixel 3XL boast an impressive camera, wireless charging, a better battery, dual front-facing cameras, and more. The new phones hope to challenge Apple's latest iPhones. The company also sells an iPad-like tablet product called the Pixel Slate.Plus, the search engine powerhouse recently introduced its new Google Home Hub that allows users to voice-control other smart home products, such as security cameras and lights. Home Hub also features Google's voice-assistant technology as it fights against Amazon and others in the crowded home assistant market.Investors should also note that Google is considering plans to offer its search engine in China once again. The firm famously pulled out of the world's second-largest economy in 2010 in order to protest Chinese government censorship, among other things. But the company is reportedly in the midst of deciding whether or not to jump back into China with a tailored version of its search engine to meet Chinese government censorship standards.OverviewGoogle is coming off a quarter that saw its total revenues surge 26% to reach $32.65 billion.The firm that claims roughly 37% of the total U.S. digital advertising market-ahead of Facebook's 20%-posted 24% growth in Q2 ad revenues.Meanwhile, Alphabet's "Google other revenues" category, which is comprised of the Google Play Store, Google Cloud offerings, and its hardware initiatives, surged over 36% to touch $4.43 billion.Moving on, shares of Google have performed far worse over the last year than some of its tech behemoth peers, such as Amazon and Apple. In fact, GOOGL stock is up roughly 9.5% during the last 12 months, which falls just below the S&P 500's 10% climb.Google stock has, however, outperformed its industry's 14% decline. Plus, GOOGL's recent dip has its stock price resting roughly 15% below its 52-week high. This might set up a solid buying opportunity ahead of its Q3 earnings release.Q3 OutlookOur current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Google's Q3 revenues to climb by approximately 22.4% to reach $27.25 billion. Looking a bit further ahead, the firm is expected to see its fiscal year revenues hit $109.6 billion, which would represent a 22.9% jump.At the other end of the income statement, Alphabet's adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to pop by 9.7% to hit $10.50 per share. Meanwhile, the firm's adjusted EPS figure is expected to expand by 24% in fiscal 2018.Bottom LineAlphabet has seen its earnings estimates trend upward for fiscal 2018 over the last 30 days, but its Q3 revisions have moved in the opposite direction. These mixed earnings revision trends help Alphabet land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment.The firm does currently sport an "A" grade for Growth and a "B" for Momentum in our Style Scores system, and might be worth considering before it releases its Q3 earnings.Alphabet is scheduled to report its third quarter 2018 financial results on Thursday, October 25.Wall Street's Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It's a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339support@zacks.comhttp://www.zacks.comPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOctober is turning into a big month for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). September was the annual iPhone event, but today is the day the iPhone XR - pegged to be the big hit of this year's iPhones - is finally available for pre-order. Adding to the excitement, AAPL just sent out media invites for a function on Oct. 30 in New York. What will the company reveal at the Oct. 30 Apple event?We have some pretty good ideas of what's to come.Yesterday, media invites went out for an October Apple event . Rather than the Steve Jobs theater on Apple's campus, the company chose Brooklyn, New York as the location. With the New York locale, the good news is we aren't forced to deal with California time, so Apple CEO Tim Cook will take to the stage at 10 a.m. EST.October events are rare, but not unheard of from Apple. In 2016 , the company waited until October to announce the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and the 4K Apple TV. In 2014, it was the iPad Air 2, iPad Mini and iMac with 5K Retina display. This year, we are definitely looking for new hardware announcements from the company.One of the key reveals of this October Apple event is expected to be new iPad Pro models. AAPL has moved to edge-to-edge screens with Face ID and no Home button for all of its 2018 iPhones. The company is expected to extend this design feature to the iPad Pro.We're looking for new models that incorporate True Depth cameras and Face ID. This will let Apple ditch the Home button, and seriously reduce bezels. As a result, the new iPad Pro models should be able to keep the same display sizes as current models, while becoming physically smaller.That's a big deal in itself. But there's a rumor that just won't go away suggesting Apple will drop the Lightning port in the 2018 iPad Pro in favor of USB-C. Doing so would enable features like 4K video output, making the iPad Pro even more useful for professionals.The new iPad Pro models expected at the October Apple event are said to represent the biggest update to the lineup since their 2015 introduction. With iPad revenue down 5% last quarter and both Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google releasing compelling new tablets in recent weeks, the pressure is on Apple to wow prosumers.The other key hardware announcements at the October Apple event are expected to be Mac-related. The Mac is still Apple's third largest division by revenue, and it continues to have a very real impact on AAPL stock. In Q3, Mac revenue was down 5% compared to last year and the number of units sold was down 9%. That shows a weakness in its entry level offerings.That's not surprising given the MacBook Air and Mac Mini - the most affordable Apple laptop and desktop PC, respectively - have gone years without updates. Their hardware is antiquated. The Mac Minim, for example, has not seen an update since 2014.We've been waiting for a replacement for the MacBook Air for much of 2018, and odds are it will be unveiled on Oct. 30. Look for a laptop in the $1,000 range with a Retina display and slimmer bezels than the 13-inch MacBook Air it replaces. It seems likely to keep the current MacBook Air form factor in order to help distinguish it from the more expensive MacBook.A new Mac Mini is highly possible as well. Bloomberg thinks that AAPL is going to target pro users this time , offering higher end processor and storage options. This would make the Mac Mini more expensive than the current $499 version , but with the iMac starting at $1,099, it should still keep its title as the most affordable Mac - at least in its base configuration.You can watch the October Apple event live on Oct. 30 starting at 10 a.m. EST. Or, you can check out InvestorPlace . We'll have everything the company announces, including any new hardware, right after the presentation wraps, along with thoughts on any big impact on AAPL stock.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s.The post What Will Apple Reveal At Its October 30 Event? appeared first on InvestorPlace .
 Next month,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) is set to report its financial results for the   fourth quarter of its fiscal 2018 and issue financial guidance   for the Q1 of fiscal 2019.Let's look at the key metrics analysts and investors will be   watching, and what numbers analysts are expecting to see when the   results go live.  Image source: Apple.When the company issued its guidance for Q4, it told investors   to expect revenue of between $60 billion and $62 billion. The   analyst consensus calls the for the company to report $61.44   billion in revenue and $2.77 in earnings per share -- up 16.9%   and 33.8%, respectively, year over year.While investors should pay attention to these numbers, it's   important to remember that Apple's Q4 ended on Sept. 29, meaning   the results incorporate only nine days of iPhone XS and XS Max   sales and no   iPhone XR    sales.In short, the results mostly represent the last hurrah of the   last iPhone product cycle. That's why I'm more interested in the   projections the company provides for the following quarter.For Q1 2019, analysts are expecting the company to turn in a   whopping $92.67 billion in revenue and $4.93 per share in   earnings, representing 5% and 26.7% year-over-year growth,   respectively.Apple's high-end iPhone XS and XS Max devices will be   available throughout the entirety of the quarter, but the   lower-end iPhone XR, the device that's expected to be the   most popular model in the lineup    , won't be available in stores until Oct. 26, with preorders   starting on Oct. 19.What's potentially more interesting with respect to the iPhone   XR is that at least one analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo with TF   International Securities, seems to think the device will have   staying power into the following quarter.Here's what Kuo had to say, as reported by   MacRumors    :We expect XR shipments to beat low seasonality in 1Q19. We     forecast that XR shipments in 1Q19 will decline 25-30% QoQ     [quarter over quarter] to 27-30mn units, and we attribute the     lower XR shipment QoQ decline, compared with general consumer     electronics and smartphones' 30-40% QoQ decline, to better     replacement demand and production delay. Also, XR's shipment     QoQ decline in 1Q19 will be better than the iPhone 8 series'     45-50% in 1Q18.Since Apple doesn't provide guidance for more than one   quarter, we won't know whether Kuo's analysis was correct until   the company reports its Q1 results, during which the company   would provide financial guidance for the following quarter.Although many will be interested in the consolidated financial   results Apple reports, I'm interested in seeing if the services   business was able to continue its strong momentum. Some insight   into how the Apple Watch is doing would be most welcome,   since Apple should have a good idea by now of how well the   Apple Watch Series 4    is being received.I'll be back with in-depth analysis of the quarter and more   after the company reports its results on Nov. 1.  10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

 By Medha Singh Oct 19 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose broadly on Friday, driven by the consumer staples sector which was helped by Procter & Gamble results, brushing aside growth risk concerns in Europe and political tensions in Saudi Arabia. Consumer goods bellwether Procter & Gamble  reported a surprise rise in first-quarter sales, sending its shares up 6.8 percent and boosting the consumer staples  index by 1.8 percent. Analysts also said China's move to calm its markets, with regulators pledging to enact measures to help ease corporate financing problems, helped improve sentiment globally. "The fact that China is supporting its market is a comfort for the U.S. That combined with strong earnings is giving a bit of a breather from macro events," said Tony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust in Wilmington, Delaware. At 11:34 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was up 90.67 points, or 0.36 percent, at 25,470.12, the S&P 500  was up 12.99 points, or 0.47 percent, at 2,781.77 and the Nasdaq Composite  was up 34.52 points, or 0.46 percent, at 7,519.66. U.S. stocks fell more than 1 percent on Thursday, weighed down by the European Commission's warning to Italy and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's decision to pull out of an investor conference in Saudi Arabia. Friday's rebound was also driven by a 1.7 percent gain in Apple, after the company began taking pre-orders for its new iPhone XR and on Wedbush's "outperform" rating. Among gainers on strong results was PayPal, which rose 9.2 percent and was on track for its best daily gain in two years after the payments company beat quarterly profit estimates.  Schlumberger  rose 1 percent as its third-quarter profit increased on higher oilfield services demand.  Honeywell  shares pared earlier gains to edge 1.7 percent higher as the industrial conglomerate said it was seeing slower growth in China and that trade tariffs would squeeze margins and potentially cost it "hundreds of millions" of dollars in 2019.  "Potential slowdown of global growth due to tariffs between the U.S. and other countries is really very concerning," Roth said. Earnings growth for S&P 500 companies is expected to have increased 22.2 percent in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv data. Of the 84 companies that have reported earnings so far, 78.6 percent have beaten expectations. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 1.62-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.02-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and 27 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 10 new highs and 100 new lows.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAny lingering hopes of a renewed recovery effort were dashed on Thursday. Stocks were upended, with the S&P 500 falling to end the day back underneath its 200-day moving average line. This second wave of selling may not be as easily stopped as the first one was, now that traders realize the kind of battle they'll have to fight just to help stocks hold their ground.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) did the most net damage, with shares of the world's biggest company sliding 2.3% lower. The selling had less to do with the company and more to do with the overall market though. Should the market slip back into panic mode, not even the top names are immune to the headwind.It wasn't all bad though. General Electric (NYSE: GE ) shares gained 1.6% as investors started leaning toward the notion that the new CEO may be exactly what the company needs. There just weren't enough names like GE to keep the broad market out of the red.Mostly, however, stocks are being pushed around in both directions by an overwhelming level of uncertainty, and growing volatility. Headed into Friday's action, it's the stock charts of Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI ), Danaher (NYSE: DHR ) and Viacom (NASDAQ: VIAB ) that look like they have the most to offer traders. Here's a closer look at why.Kinder Morgan is a name we've looked at more than a few times of late, waiting to see if it will break above a key technical ceiling at $18.37. It did, back on Oct. 9, ultimately propelled by support from a couple of key moving average lines. That breakout move crumbled big-time the very next day though, letting KMI slide back to its last-ditch floor provided by the 200-day moving average line.That breakout move may be a short-lived one though, setting the stage for a little more downside after all. Thursday's intraday pullback may have just set the stage for a more serious breakdown.
 Click to Enlarge  • Yesterday's move to the ceiling at $18.37, plotted in yellow, is suspicious in that Kinder Morgan shares only has to kiss that level to draw out the profit-takers.• Equally suspicious is the sheer amount of selling volume we've seen on recent bearish days, and the lack of volume seen with the rebound days logged over the course of the previous four trading days.• The line in the sand is once again the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts. That was the reversal point a week ago, but the more it gets tested, the more apt it is to eventually break… especially now that we have a bearish MACD crossunder on the weekly chart.A little over a month ago, Danaher was in breakout mode, having pushed its way above a technical ceiling at $104.32. That bullish hint ended up panning out too, with a move toward the $110 area by early this month.Much has changed in the meantime though, with Thursday's bar serving as a huge red flag of bearishness. The stock's on the brink of a major meltdown, and could move into that move with just one more false step.
 Click to Enlarge  • Thursday's bar is problematic, mostly in that the decent open turned into a miserable close. Yesterday's bar completed engulfed Wednesday's bar with a move back into a bearish direction. The sheer scope of the reversal speaks volumes.• Also speaking volumes is volume itself. There's plenty of it when Danaher shares are pulling back, but little of it on days DHR has made forward progress.• Danaher has already broken below the rising support line, plotted in white with a dashed line, though the 200-day moving average plotted with a solid white line is still holding up as a floor. For the second time in two weeks, though, the bears are working on breaking it. A close below it from here could start a wave of weakness.Last but not least, not all stocks are knocking on the door of lower lows. A handful of names are testing the waters of higher highs. Viacom is one of them. Though VIAB may need to move lower before moving higher, a prolonged rally may already be in the works.
 Click to Enlarge • Though erratic, Viacom has logged a string of higher lows and higher highs since June. The end result is bigger-picture bullishness, even if it's a stop and start bullishness.• That said, respect the fact that VIAB rises and falls on a regular basis. The daily chart's stochastic indicator is almost back into overbought territory again, which has prompted profit-taking since June as well.• Nevertheless, if and when Viacom shares can clear the resistance at $34.60 where it struggled at the beginning of the year, plotted with a white dashed line on the weekly chart, the stock might finally end the back-and-forth pattern and finally start to trend higher with some consistency. We won't know for sure until it bucks the pattern for the first time.• Once it does though, it won't likely start doing that again without a catalyst to put it back in that mode. A revisit to the 2017 peak around $46 could be that catalyst, though that mark would also make the ideal breakout target.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

 World's leading business magazine Forbes is partnering with blockchain start-up Civil to publish its content on the blockchain platform. The magazine is merging Civil's software with its content management system so that it can start uploading content on a decentralized system beginning 2019. This arrangement is expected to make it impossible for a third party to alter or remove Forbes' content.Forbes is experimenting with the blockchain platform, per the agreement with Civil. The magazine will publish metadata from few articles on the platform in the first quarter of next year and if results are affirmative, it may publish metadata from all of its articles on blockchain later.Forbes' move to test blockchain comes at a time when the technology is gaining momentum outside the cryptocurrency market and more industries are realizing its potential as a secure, fast, inexpensive and accurate system.Earlier in May, Facebook FB  created a blockchain division led by David Marcus, former PayPal president and ex-boss of Facebook Messenger. The social media giant aims to explore the technology and discover its potential uses for Facebook.Blockchain technology's rapid implementation across industries such as insurance, supply chain management, automobile, payments, banking, and media is making these businesses immune to cyber-attacks. What Makes Blockchain Effective? Blockchain's robustness lies in its architecture. The technology's decentralized system that stores information in a peer-to-peer manner makes it extremely secure as more than one copy of the information exists on multiple systems. Encrypted and time-stamped information is stored in blocks which can only be accessed and altered by users who hold a private key to unlock the block. These blocks are interlinked and thus form a chain.Whenever information is changed in any block, the entire chain gets updated. Therefore, any attempt to hack this system can be easily noticed and data breach can be stopped at a preliminary stage without affecting information.Blockchain's effectiveness in recordkeeping and security gives it a powerful stance over other technologies popular in the domain. Given the frequency of cyber-attacks on corporate giants, blockchain's secure platform stands to gain fast adoption by companies globally. Who Else is Betting on Blockchain Technology?  According to MarketsandMarkets, global blockchain operations are expected to witness a compound annual growth rate of 79.6%to USD 7,683.7 million by 2022. Given the growth forecast for blockchain, investors should keep the related stocks in their watch list.You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   .

Wall St set to rebound on strong earnings
 By Medha Singh Oct 19 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set to open higher on Friday as a handful of major U.S. companies posted strong results, helping to relieve concerns about political and growth risks in Europe and Saudi Arabia that drove a 1 percent fall a day earlier. Consumer goods bellwether Procter & Gamble  reported a surprise rise in first-quarter sales, sending its shares 4.9 percent higher in premarket trading, while industrial conglomerate Honeywell  rose 2.1 percent after the boom in ecommerce drove bumper sales of warehouse machinery.  In a volatile week for stocks, any gains for the benchmark S&P 500  on Friday would snap a three-week losing streak. "There have been macro concerns but results have been the biggest driver this week, and today is no different," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York. Wall Street has had a rough ride over the past fortnight, suffering one of its worst two-day losses since 2015 on concerns over rising interest rates, trade tariffs and their impact on global growth and demand for stocks. U.S. stocks fell more than 1 percent on Thursday, weighed down by the European Commission's warning to Italy and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's decision to pull out of an investor conference in Saudi Arabia. Among other gainers on strong results was PayPal, which climbed 7.6 percent after the payments company beat quarterly profit estimates, signing up more customers and raising volume of payments processed. Schlumberger  reversed earlier losses to trade 1.5 percent higher as its third-quarter profit increased on higher oilfield services demand.  Interpublic Group  jumped 5.5 percent after the U.S. advertising firm beat quarterly revenue estimates, benefiting from higher client spending worldwide.   Honeywell's beat on profit, however, followed a batch of disappointing results from industrial companies a day earlier that did little to soothe worries over the impact of tariffs, rising borrowing costs and wages on corporate profits. Earnings growth for S&P 500 companies is expected to have increased 22 percent in the third quarter, a slowdown from the first half, according to Refinitiv data. Of the 69 companies that have reported earnings so far, 78.3 percent have beaten expectations. Apple  rose 1.2 percent as it began taking pre-orders for its new iPhone XR and Wedbush upgraded the stock expecting the company to benefit from more customers upgrading their phones. Other members of the FAANG group also gained nearly a percent. Walt Disney  rose 1.4 percent after Barclays upgraded its shares to "over weight", saying its purchase of $71 billion of assets from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc  may mark a turning point for the company.

 By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The pressure is on for Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft as they prepare to report quarterly results at a time when confidence in those market leaders looks increasingly fragile and in danger of derailing Wall Street's rally. After worries about higher interest rates sparked a steep sell-off in early October and again on Thursday, the S&P 500 remains down 5 percent from its Sept. 20 record high close, with top-shelf stocks including Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc, Netflix Inc  and Facebook Inc  showing little of their vitality from recent years. "The equity market is at a critical point here," said Kurt Brunner, portfolio manager, Swarthmore Group in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. "In order for it not to get a lot worse, I think you need to see Amazon and Alphabet put up some good numbers." With investors worried about increased internet regulation and criticism of Facebook's handling of user data, the social media company's stock has slumped 29 percent from its record high on July 25. Alphabet is 15 percent below its July 26 record high close, while Amazon has fallen 12 percent this month. Microsoft has also stalled after doubling over the past two years. Still, Netflix and Amazon remain up 81 percent and 51 percent year to date, respectively, underscoring their places among Wall Street's crème de la crème. The S&P 500's largest component, Apple Inc  has gained 28 percent in 2018, even after falling 7 percent from its record high on Oct. 3. A 5 percent surge in Netflix on Wednesday after its upbeat quarterly report allayed fears the video streaming company was losing steam.  But that did little to perk up its fellow stocks in the so-called FANG group that also includes Amazon, Google-parent Alphabet and Facebook. In the past, those stocks have often risen together.  Powerful rallies by Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft and Netflix in recent years have made them must-own stocks for portfolio managers, making their ownership so widespread that they are at risk of a major sell-off should a majority of investors' views about them change for the worse. "So many funds are invested in the same stocks. They got less crowded in the past week, but at this point it's difficult to say if we are going to shrug everything off and go to new highs a month from now, or if we're going to test more lows," warned Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas. The recent slide has left Amazon and Facebook trading at discounted multiples of their expected earnings. Amazon's forward price-to-earnings ratio last week touched 74, a seven-year low, according to Refinitiv data. Facebook this month traded as little as 18 times expected earnings, the lowest since its 2012 public listing. 
 ROBUST EARNINGS GROWTH Helped by a strong economy and deep corporate tax cuts, S&P 500 earnings per share are expected to grow 22 percent in the third quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. But some investors are already eyeing slower growth in 2019, when the corporate tax cut benefits will be a year old and no longer create an extra boost. Investors are also nervous about potential fallout from U.S. President Donald Trump's trade conflict with Beijing, and higher interest rates as the strong U.S. economy and low unemployment pressure prices. Propelled by its cloud computing business, Amazon is expected by analysts to report a September-quarter non-GAAP net profit of $1.54 billion, or $3.12 per share, compared to just $256 million a year ago, according to Refinitiv. Alphabet's September-quarter non-GAAP net profit is seen rising 9 percent to $7.36 billion, or $10.43 per share. Microsoft's non-GAAP net income is seen rising 13 percent to $7.46 billion, or 96 cents per share. Facebook reports its quarterly results on Oct. 30, followed on Nov. 1 by Apple. Amazon and Alphabet are widely considered technology companies. However, within S&P Dow Jones Indices' Global Industry Classification Standard, Amazon falls into the consumer discretionary sector and Alphabet belongs to the recently renamed communication services sector.  
 
 
 SHANGHAI, Oct 19 (Reuters) - A Chinese consumer body has criticised iPhone maker Apple Inc  over a recent data security issue which impacted a number of consumers in China who said they had suffered financial losses after having their Apple IDs stolen. Apple said earlier this month that an internal investigation had found that a "small number of our users' accounts were accessed through phishing scams where two-factor authentication was not enabled". The U.S. company, which makes and sells huge numbers of its products in China, added the issue had also led to a rise in "false and fraudulent refund claims trying to take advantage of this incident." "Apple should not shift the blame, play down its own safety issues and divert consumers' attention," the association said. The case was trending in the top 10 most-read topics on China's Twitter-like social media platform Weibo on Friday. The issue is a potential headache for Apple in the world's second-largest economy, with the U.S. firm already facing a potentially tough balancing act in the country amid a whipsawing trade war between the United States and China. Chinese mobile payment platform Alipay said last week that hackers had taken an unknown amount of money from user accounts using stolen Apple IDs and the issue remained unresolved despite reaching out to the U.S. firm.  Apple declined to comment further on Friday, referring back to its earlier statement on the matter. "We regret the inconvenience caused to our customers by these phishing scams," the firm said in that statement. "We are proactively identifying suspicious activities and reaching out to affected customers. We strongly advise all users to enable two-factor authentication, which prevents unauthorized access to their accounts." Apple added it was communicating with "relevant consumer agencies and listening to customer feedback about those changes". Apple was chastised by Chinese state media in July for the amount of spam being sent on iMessage, with media saying with the company's strict stance on privacy was hindering its ability to crack down on illegal behaviour. 
 
5 Top Stock Trades for Friday: Trading Apple, PayPal Earnings
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThought we'd get a rubber-band bounce back up? Not the case this time. U.S. stocks bounced off their lows last week, but quickly gave up their gains for this week. Equities continue to languish as investors weigh higher rates, among other things. In light of this action, here are our top stock trades for Friday.Let's start with the biggest of them all: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ).The stock still sports a market cap north of $1 trillion, a surprisingly upbeat note considering the current climate. However, if the bears get to Apple, it could have a wide-ranging impact on the market, particularly the Nasdaq.So far, Apple has been churning between $215 and $230, but is now below the 50-day moving average. An uptrend is in play (blue line), but below that the 100-day moving average is a possibility.A full-blown breakdown could land shares in the mid-$190s, where another uptrend (purple) and 200-day currently rest. But so far, over the 100-day and $215 level, Apple still looks okay.After a jump on the new Call of Duty game, Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI ) has been a big-time disappointment.So far, the top of range is holding steady as resistance, but the bottom of the channel is a little shakier. Just over $70 is a rough estimate for this mark.Honestly, the action isn't great, particularly given the broader market's action lately. I would feel better about ATVI with shares over the 200-day moving average, but below $70 and it could turn ugly if the overall market remains under pressure. If you're long, watch this mark.Used as a proxy for the Nasdaq, the PowerShares QQQ ETF (NASDAQ: QQQ ) has not looked good.With the exception of one trading day, the QQQ has held its 200-day moving average as support. However, like the S&P 500 , the 100-day moving average is now acting as resistance. Below $170 and the 200-day, and the prior lows near $167.50 are on deck.Below that and we could get an even larger correction. So pay careful attention to this level over the next few days. A retest of the lows wouldn't be all that surprising.Blackstone (NYSE: BX ) beat on earnings and revenue expectations, but shares are down about 2.5% on the day despite the results.That's put Blackstone right into a very critical spot, in my view. Aggressive buyers can nibble BX stock here so long as $35 holds as support. They can use Thursday's low as their stop.Conservative buyers may want to wait for a breakdown to the $32 to $33 level, where BX will find the 50-week moving average and uptrend support. Don't forget about that 6.5% yield.PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ) will report earnings after the close on Thursday. This company continues to do quite well, yet the stock market is not rewarding its fundamentals. That said, PYPL is a pricey name as well.Should shares rally, see how they handle the $81 level. Not only has this area been significant in the past, but its the recent high where PayPal pulled back from earlier this week. Above that is the 200-day moving average. A rally and fail to this mark will also be a concern.On the downside, see how the recent lows near $75 hold up.

Will Apple Really Switch Macs Off Intel Chips in 2020?
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has been selling Mac computers powered by Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) processors since 2006. However, in recent years the partnership hasn't been as advantageous for Apple as it once was. At the same time, AAPL has proven that designing its own custom, ARM-based chips for iOS devices has big benefits. A noted Apple analyst is predicting Apple will release an ARM-based Mac as soon as 2020, ditching Intel. This follows a report in Bloomberg earlier this year, with similar claims.It could be nothing, but where there's smoke there is often fire.Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has a reputation for getting things right when it comes to forecasting the company's moves. He has just released an investor note ( reported in 9to5 Mac ) predicting that Apple will begin to ditch Intel CPUs in favor of its own ARM-based chips for Mac computers, starting in 2020.Kuo's note echos a similar report published by Bloomberg in April. In it, Bloomberg detailed several AAPL projects aimed at making all Apple devices work seamlessly together, along with a platform to run iOS apps on Macs. With a claim that Apple would move from Intel processors to ARM-based Macs starting in 2020, the report hit Intel stock hard at the time of publication, with INTC taking a 9.2% hit at one point.If Kuo and Bloomberg are right, that's obviously going to be bad news for Intel. AAPL is estimated to account for roughly 5% of INTC's income, although some of that revenue is from the Intel modems now in iPhones -  given Apple's spat with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ), that revenue stream at least should be safe.Apple announced it was transitioning its Mac computers from PowerPC processors to Intel chips in 2005. The first Intel-based Macs arrived in 2006, and Apple has done pretty well with its computers since then.However, Apple is at the mercy of Intel's processor release schedule. In recent years, that dependence has been blamed for delaying the release of new Macs . While AAPL has the advantage over other PC makers of completely controlling the operating system that powers its computers, the degree of optimization AAPL can offer is limited by the fact that it's still using the same Intel processors as the competition.AAPL has proven the advantages of pairing its own operating system with its own, custom designed ARM chips. Apple's A-series processors have proven extremely successful in the iPhone and iPad, and let the company offer features and efficiencies that other smartphone makers - typically using Qualcomm Snapdragon mobile CPUs - aren't able to match. The company has already taken the first step toward bringing its own chips to Macs, with an ARM processor powering the Touch Bar on the MacBook Pro.With an ARM-based Mac, Apple could boost Mac sales against Windows rivals by leveraging complete control of the hardware and operating system the way it has done with the iPhone.There is also potential to make Mac sales more profitable. While there are licensing fees involved in using the ARM architecture and TSMC (NYSE: TSM ) is expected to be tapped to manufacture the chips, Apple would still likely come out ahead compared to buying Intel processors. The cheapest Intel Core M mobile CPU - similar to those Apple uses in its $1,299 MacBook -  currently sells for over $280 . Apple obviously receives a volume discount from Intel, but considering the A-12 processor and modem combined in the iPhone XS Max are estimated to cost Apple $72 , there's probably room for Apple to save money by ditching Intel.At the end of the day, iPhones dominate AAPL's financials and remain the primary driver of Apple stock. But Mac sales are still the company's third largest source of revenue (the Mac division reported $5.3 billion in revenue last quarter). The potential to boost the profitability of Mac computers and possibly even increase in sales - by cutting Intel out of the equation and going with custom ARM-based Mac PCs - is tough to dismiss.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s.The post Will Apple Really Switch Macs Off Intel Chips in 2020? appeared first on InvestorPlace .
10 Cheap Consumer Stocks for an Uncertain Market
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor a few days, it looked like the market might get back into a "risk on" mood again, favoring growth names over "cheap stocks" regardless of their frothy valuations, at the expense of consumer-oriented stocks regardless of their all-weather reliability. Now the question is back on the table.Or, maybe it was never really off the table. A look back at the way things have taken shape over the course of the past few weeks indicates that consumer-oriented and safe-haven names have actually done rather well, while growth names haven't.Better still, some of the most compelling picks from the consumer sectors are still stunningly cheap stocks right now. Considering the uncertainty ahead, wise investors should make a point of upping their exposure to this sliver of the market for the indefinite future.With that as the backdrop, here's a run-down of the top ten most attractive consumer stocks you can own right now.[Editor's note: This story was originally published in July 2018. It has since been updated and republished to coincide with the similar consumer stocks market environment of October 2018.]It's boring, but that's the point.You've probably held a Packaging Corp (NYSE: PKG ) product in your hands without even realizing it. The company makes all sorts of boxes , including those used to transport fruits and vegetables that then become suitable displays in a grocery store. That's only the beginning though. Packaging Corp makes storage and display solutions of all sorts, most of which consumers and corporations purchase regardless of the economic backdrop.It's unlikely the outfit will ever post jaw-dropping sales or earnings growth, but with a forward-looking P/E of less than 13 , there's certainly plenty of value on the table.Socks and underwear? Like Packaging Corp, it's a product line that never goes out of style. That alone isn't a reason one might want to own Hanesbrands (NYSE: HBI ) though. Neither is the perfectly palatable forward-looking P/E of 11.5 . Even the dividend yield of 2.7% isn't necessarily a must-have.Rather, the reason HBI is so compelling here is that the analyst community is only lukewarm on the stock, sporting an average price target of $22.47. That's almost where the stock's priced right now.There's a method to the madness. It's called contrarianism. The time to step into a solid name is when it's out of favor. If Hanesbrands continues to product the kind of sales and profit growth it's been driving, the professionals will have to warm up to it again.Those impending upgrades could light a real fire below the stock.Edgewell Personal Care (NYSE: EPC ) is probably a name most investors haven't heard of. It's a name most investors are more familiar with than they realize though.Ever heard of Schick shaving products? How about Hawaiian Tropic suntan lotion? Playtex? Those are all personal care products made by Edgewell .It hasn't been the strongest of companies for the past few years, and subsequently, analysts are less-than-thrilled. Like Hanesbrands though, that sets the stage for lots of upgrades and increases in price targets. And, with next year projected as something of a turning point in terms of sales and profits, those improved opinions may start to take shape sooner than later… particularly if other sectors start to fall out of favor.The forward-looking P/E of 14.3 doesn't exactly place Edgewell among the cheapest of the cheap stocks, but it's certainly far from being expensive given the backdrop.You may know the name Brunswick (NYSE: BC ) as a maker of bowling balls and bowling pins. But, that's not all the company does. In fact, it doesn't even do that anymore, having sold its bowling business off to a privately held outfit back in 2015. All it does now is make boats and billiard products, and fitness equipment .It's good at what it does though … real good. Even when the economy was just so-so a couple of years ago, the company was producing growth. Now that the economy is humming and consumer confidence is soaring, they're willing and able to splurge a little.That makes BC shares, priced at only 13 times next year's expected profits, a compelling prospect.That's not a misprint. Though iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is often thought of a technology stock, it's much more aligned with (and dependent on) consumers and their moods. Its products are built for all sorts of people, customizable for various preferences, and serve as a delivery vehicle for all sorts of digital entertainment ranging from music to video to games.It's a consumer-centric company, whether its future focus is hardware or the digital content that makes its hardware fun and fulfilling to use.It's also a relatively cheap company, given its revenue growth rate. Its top line is expected to improve to the tune of 14% this year, versus a trailing P/E of 18.4 and a forward-looking one of only 14.4. That's cheap, and even more so by technology stock standards.Yes, this is the same Carter's (NYSE: CRI ) that makes baby clothes - an arena where consumers tend not to skimp.Like most of the other value-priced names on this list of cheap stocks within the consumer goods sector, Carter's isn't growing like gangbusters. Indeed, it's barely growing at all. This year's top line is projected to improve by less than 3%, and then ramp up by only 4% next year.Slow and steady wins the race, particularly when earnings are growing considerably faster than sales are. This year's expected income of $6.45 per share is a 12% improvement on last year's $5.76, while next year's estimate of $7.05 is 9% better than this year's expected bottom line. And for the record, Carter's has topped estimates for six straight quarter's now .All of a sudden that relatively low projected P/E of 16.4 looks like even more of a bargain.Although there's no denying the home-construction market is better than it was just a few years ago following the post-subprime-meltdown malaise, there's also no way of denying it may never become the fever-pitched frenzy it was back in 2006.Instead, people are staying put, choosing to improve the home they live in now rather than buy a new home. Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies' Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity (LIRA) suggests remodeling expenditures will remain above 7 % over the remainder of 2018 and into 2019, which is even more growth than we've seen in recent years.It's a trend that bodes quite well for Mohawk Industries (NYSE: MHK ), which is the world's largest carpet and flooring materials company. It's also a trend that makes its projected P/E of 13.1 an even juicier bargain.If the name Newell Brands (NYSE: NWL ) seems familiar but you can't quite make the connection, add the word 'Rubbermaid' to it. Yes, Newell Brands is the parent of Newell Rubbermaid. It also owns brands like Yankee Candle, Graco, Oster, Sharpie and more . It makes a little of everything, and most of its products are goods you don't give a second thought about.The past twelve months have been tough ones for shareholders. NWL stock has lost roughly half of its value since July of 2017, with most of the concern centering on a sales slowdown that's forced the company to take rather drastic action .The sellers have arguably overshot though. Newell shares are priced at 6.2 times their trailing income and less than 10 times next year's expected income  at a point in time when consumer spending is strengthening and a legitimate company turnaround is in view.There used to be a time when Whirlpool (NYSE: WHR ) dominated the home appliance, if only because it was the most assessable name in the business. Those days are gone though, with newcomers entering the washer and dryer market, displacing Whirlpool. The stock, once a stalwart, has been shelved by many investors as a has-been.Big mistake.Though Whirlpool still has plenty to figure out about doing business in the modern era, sales are stabilizing, and the bottom line is growing in earnest again. The pros are calling for last year's per-share profits of $13.74 to swell to $15.63 this year, and reach $17.91 per share next year.That double-digit earnings growth pace makes the forward-looking P/E of 8.6 a screaming bargain.Last but not least, put Fortune Brands (NYSE: FBHS ) on your watchlist of cheap stocks from the consumer sector to consider.You'll likely know it as a cabinetry and fixture, and for good reason - it still makes plenty of both, under the KitchenCraft, Moen and Norcraft brands, just to name a few . The same remodeling spending news that could prove huge for Mohawk is also a wave that Fortune Brands can ride.That's not all Fortune Brands has going for it now though. The company has also gotten in on the smart-home craze, leveraging its MasterLock and American Lock brands to enter the digitally-managed lock fray (not that the basic padlock still isn't an important piece of its business).However it makes its money, the projected P/E of 13.6 is a relative bargain given its forward-looking P/E of 13.6 .As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

  MKS Instruments MKSI  is set to report third-quarter 2018 results on Oct 24.        MKS Instruments, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise    |      MKS Instruments, Inc. Quote   Key Factors      MKS Instruments is gaining from strong semiconductor, industrial   and other advanced end-markets demand.        The company's strategy to diversify revenue streams toward   high-margin and high-growth advance markets is reflected in its   top line growth. Notably, in the last reported quarter, sales   from advanced markets were up 19% to $237 million from the   year-ago quarter.        The acquisition of Newport is also helping the company strengthen   its presence in the advanced markets. The acquisition has helped   MKS Instruments expand its market segments and win new orders,   which is a positive.        Additionally, the company's investments in the light and motion   division, which is approximately $1 billion annualized run-rate,   are expected to contribute to third-quarter 2018 revenues.        These investments helped MKS Instruments expand its offerings in   areas like lithography and inspection of the semiconductor   markets, which constitute the major chunk of the company's   revenues. Notably, in the last reported quarter, sales to   semiconductor customers increased 19% year over year to $336   million.        However, moderate spending by the company's customers and   temporary softness in the semiconductor market may prove to be a   drag on third quarter revenues.     What Our Model Says      According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1   (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating   estimates if it also has a positive   Earnings ESP    .

 Shares of Alphabet Inc. GOOGL  have slipped roughly 9% over the past three months as investors worry that more government intervention could be headed Google's way. With that said, Google's parent company looks poised to post strong top and bottom line Q3 growth, while it expands its products push. Recent News Google recently launched its next-generation Pixel smartphones. The new Pixel 3 and the Pixel 3XL boast an impressive camera, wireless charging, a better battery, dual front-facing cameras, and more. The new phones hope to challenge Apple's AAPL  latest iPhones. The company also sells an iPad-like tablet product called the Pixel Slate.Plus, the search engine powerhouse recently introduced its new Google Home Hub that allows users to voice-control other smart home products, such as security cameras and lights. Home Hub also features Google's voice-assistant technology as it fights against Amazon AMZN  and others in the crowded home assistant market.Investors should also note that Google is considering plans  to offer its search engine in China once again. The firm famously pulled out of the world's second-largest economy in 2010 in order to protest Chinese government censorship, among other things. But the company is reportedly in the midst of deciding whether or not to jump back into China with a tailored version of its search engine to meet Chinese government censorship standards. Overview Google is coming off a quarter that saw its total revenues surge 26% to reach $32.65 billion.The firm that claims roughly 37% of the total U.S. digital advertising market-ahead of Facebook's FB  20%-posted 24% growth in Q2 ad revenues.Meanwhile, Alphabet's "Google other revenues" category, which is comprised of the Google Play Store, Google Cloud offerings, and its hardware initiatives, surged over 36% to touch $4.43 billion.Moving on, shares of Google have performed far worse over the last year than some of its tech behemoth peers, such as Amazon and Apple. In fact, GOOGL stock is up roughly 9.5% during the last 12 months, which falls just below the S&P 500's 10% climb. Google stock  has, however, outperformed its industry's 14% decline. Plus, GOOGL's recent dip has its stock price resting roughly 15% below its 52-week high. This might set up a solid buying opportunity ahead of its Q3 earnings release.     Q3 Outlook Our current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Google's Q3 revenues to climb by approximately 22.4% to reach $27.25 billion. Looking a bit further ahead, the firm is expected to see its fiscal year revenues hit $109.6 billion, which would represent a 22.9% jump.At the other end of the income statement, Alphabet's adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to pop by 9.7% to hit $10.50 per share. Meanwhile, the firm's adjusted EPS figure is expected to expand by 24% in fiscal 2018. Bottom Line Alphabet has seen its earnings estimates trend upward for fiscal 2018 over the last 30 days, but its Q3 revisions have moved in the opposite direction. These mixed earnings revision trends help Alphabet land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment.The firm does currently sport an "A" grade for Growth and a "B" for Momentum in our Style Scores system, and might be worth considering before it releases its Q3 earnings.Alphabet is scheduled to report its third quarter 2018 financial results on Thursday, October 25.

 As   expected    ,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) does have more stuff to show off for 2018. There   are several products that are reportedly in the pipeline that   were not unveiled at the company's September event, which focused   on iPhones and Apple Watch. The Mac maker has just officially   announced that it is hosting a product event on Oct. 30. Instead   of having the event at its Steve Jobs theater, the tech titan   will show off its gadgets in New York this time.Here's what investors can expect.  iPad Pro. Image source: Apple.Reports surfaced   last year    that Apple was working on bringing its TrueDepth camera system   and Face ID to the iPad Pro, along with an edge-to-edge display   while removing the home button. Some analysts had expected the   new iPad Pro to launch   earlier this year    , but it seems Apple needed more development time.More recently, there have been clues within iOS 12 code   that show Face ID is coming to the iPad, and the 3D facial   recognition technology is expected to work in   landscape mode. There are also rumors that Apple may use a   USB-C port in the new iPads instead of its proprietary Lightning   connector. It's also probably time to kill off the headphone jack   for the tablet.Apple is not expected to put an OLED display into the tablet,   as OLED prices are still significantly higher than a traditional   LCD panel, and iPad displays are much larger than iPhone   displays. Shifting to OLED would require a massive price increase   for Apple to maintain its margin profile. iPad unit volumes have   stagnated for a few years, and jacking prices up would only hurt   demand, so it makes sense to stick with LCD until OLED prices   come down further.Bloomberg reported in August that Apple was working on two new   Macs, including a   new entry-level MacBook    . The new notebook is expected to replace the aging MacBook Air,   which is currently the only laptop that Apple still sells that   uses a traditional low-resolution display instead of its   high-resolution Retina displays. Introducing a redesigned   entry-level MacBook could help boost Mac unit volumes over the   holiday shopping season.Apple also has a new Mac Mini in the pipeline, according to   the report, which is expected to better address professionals.   The Mac Mini is also aging poorly, having last been updated four   years ago. After admitting it made some   mistakes with the Mac Pro thermal design    , Apple has been rejiggering other Mac lines to target   professional users, such as the iMac Pro.There are some products that are unlikely to be announced at   the event. Despite announcing AirPower, a wireless charging pad,   last year, that accessory's fate remains largely unclear. Apple   has reportedly run into technical challenges in developing the   device, with it overheating. Apple has even   removed most references to the device from its website,   suggesting it could even be canceled altogether. Even if Apple is   still working on AirPower, it definitely won't be ready this   month. Microsoft    surprised the market earlier this month when it unveiled Surface   Headphones, a set of premium wireless noise-canceling over-ear   headphones. Apple is   working on a similar product    , which is expected to be released under the Apple brand instead   of its Beats lineup. There had been a chance that Apple's   headphones would be released this year, but   Bloomberg    reported over the summer that the company is now planning to   launch them in 2019 alongside second-generation AirPods.The event will cement Apple's product lineup as it heads into   the busiest quarter of the year.  10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn spite of all the worries in the media ticker tapes, the current macro economic conditions still favor the bullish thesis. Company P&L's are healthier than ever thanks to tax breaks and solid demand.Interest rates, though rising, are still low relative to history. Consumer spending is still up. Most people I talk to are happy with the way things are going. The country is politically bifurcated, but that is spurring activism. When that happens, good things can get done.The stock market is still near all-time highs. Yet everyone is bracing for a correction. So there's no commitment to sustaining a rally too exuberantly.Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) stock had its own woes. The Cambridge-Analytica event was not their fault, yet the stock suffered the consequences. Management decided not to make the incident public, so the public perception became that FB hid it because they were in the wrong. That perception was not helped by accusations that it hid its over-reporting of video ad viewership numbers.Since then, Facebook stock paid the price dearly, both on the chart and in public opinion. But that has been a U.S.-centric event. I traveled abroad and I couldn't find anyone who even spent two minutes worrying about it.So the opportunity in Facebook stock is that this too shall pass! It's worth owning for the long term. This is a company that has over a billion users engage daily and for hours at a time on its platforms. There is definite potential there.The Fundamental Opportunity: I am a fundamental trader. I look for stocks that are undervalued relative to what they can deliver in future growth. I look for innovation funded by consistent performance now.Facebook fits the profile, and the stock is cheap. It only trades at a trailing 22 price-to-earnings ratio. This is cheaper than Microsoft (NASDA: MSFT ) and half of the valuation of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ). So owning shares of Facebook right now is not likely to be a financial disaster in the long run.The stock is undervalued for the potential it can unlock. Even though I'm a fundamental trader, I do pay a lot of attention to the technicals. Facebook stock has suffered a sharp correction since its July high. It fell 30% to $150 per share. This was exactly where it bottomed last April when it fell 18%.The Technical Opportunity: If the bulls can overcome the descending lower high trend, breaching $164 per share would bring a 15% rally from there. Next week, we will get earnings from GOOGL, MSFT, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ). So the opportunity for a trigger is definitely available.
 Click to Enlarge  The reaction to the last FB earnings report was horrendous. I don't think management will deliver two ugly reports in a row. So the expectations bar maybe set low. Facebook stock also recently entered the home device market, so I'm sure they will have some exciting news about that and its future uses.I do worry a little about how concerned management is with the public opinion. I wish they would refocus more on the bottom line than appeasing a few overly concerned politicians with privacy.Facebook is a platform that only knows about me what I want to tell it about myself. I fail to see this mania over them knowing what videos I like. This is the same asset that other stocks are rallying on, everyone is excited about how Netflix can anticipate what I like to watch, or how Amazon knows what I like to buy. This is no different. I don't give FB any personal information, but I am okay them knowing my viewing habits and likes.Click  here  for more of my market thesis and get an ongoing free copy of my weekly newsletters.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of  SellSpreads.com .

Apple Expected To Unveil New IPad On Oct. 30 Event
  (RTTNews.com) - Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) will hold a special event on October 30 in Brooklyn, New York, where the tech giant is expected to launch next-gen iPad and Mac computers. The Cupertino, California-based company issued media invites on Thursday for the October 30th event with the event's tagline "there's more in the making." The tag line "There's more in the making," suggests the tech giant will unveil more products. Apple reportedly plans to release a new 11-inch iPad Pro with support for Face ID and a new Mac Mini Pro and a new lower-cost MacBook with a Retina display. Apart from Face ID, the new iPad Pro is rumored to have slim bezels and expected to switch from Lightning to USB-C and be available in 11- and 12.9-inch display sizes. Apple is also expected to share release details for iOS 12.1, which is rumored to feature Group FaceTime and dual-SIM support and the upcoming watchOS update.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe buzz surrounding the new Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone XR is palpable. The company will begin taking orders for them this week, and begin shipping them next week. Apple stock, which had been weighed down by marketwide selling earlier this month, is finding traction again. At least one analyst believes the more affordably priced device could translate into record-breaking sales (by unit) for the quarter ending this month.The buzz may well be justified. And, the analyst in question - TF International Securities' Ming-Chi Kuo - may well be right. Apple could very well sell a stunning number of iPhones in the coming weeks now that it's also offering models in the middle portion of the price spectrum.In a subtle way, most current and prospective owners of AAPL stock don't fully appreciate, though, the fourth quarter could end up being a pivotal moment for the company's flagship product.The iPhone XR, for those that can't keep up with Apple's nomenclature, is one of the newest iterations of the iPhone, unveiled in September along with the XS and the XS Max . They're follow-ups to the iPhone X, which launched in November of last year, and are distinctly not part of the iPhone 8 family.That's not the interesting part of the recently-unveiled smartphone lineup, however. What's interesting is that Apple has made an iPhone affordable again. The iPhone XR starts at only $750, whereas its more potent XS and XS Max cost no less than $1000 each - and go for even more depending on the bells and whistles included.Ming-Chi Kuo believes that price point is a sweet spot Apple wasn't hitting before.End result? Kuo upped his iPhone shipment estimates for the quarter currently underway to a range of between 78 million and 83 million units , anticipating that between 33 million and 35 million of them would be of the XR variety. Even at the lower end of that range, Apple would be getting close to its 2017 first-quarter record shipments of 78.3 million iPhones .Better yet, Kuo expects the lower-cost phone to abate the usual steep slowdown seen in the quarter following a new product launch. Rather than the usual 30% to 40% sequential lull, the analyst is only expecting the next quarter's unit sales to slump between 25% and 30% , as consumers decide they can afford the lower-cost XR after all.If there was ever a time for Apple to bump into an unexpected headwind, however, this is it.It's largely been obscured by the XR news and the recent marketwide selloff, but two of Apple's biggest smartphone competitors just unveiled phones that could turn the heads of some prospective iPhone buyers.One of those other players is, of course, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ), which recently introduced the Pixel 3. Reviewers are raving. For smartphone users that insist on a top-notch camera, the Pixel 3XL arguably outshines the XR's respectable-but-not-game-changing picture-taking tech , while other consumers may be thrilled to simply learn that the Pixel 3 series lets you use USB-C earbuds .The third generation of Pixel smartphones start at $800, which is more or less in-line with the iPhone XR.Google isn't the only player owners of Apple stock have to worry about, however. Remember Huawei, the company that sold more smartphones than Apple did during the second quarter ? It just unveiled a new smartphone too - the Mate 20 lineup. Though they won't be available in the United States (at least not yet), they start at around $1000 apiece , but may well be worth it to consumers that insist on the best of the best Android-powered smartphones. In the meantime, Huawei's P series and Mate 10 smartphones are priced more in line with the Pixel 3 and the iPhone XR and, more importantly, give would-be iPhone buyers something else to strongly consider.And consumers are clearly considering Huawei's wares. Again, the company outsold Apple during the second quarter of this year.This quarter will either demonstrate just how much of a draw the Apple name really is or indicate that most consumers were only waiting on something that competes with the iPhone on all fronts, including price. It was a showdown that, in retrospect, was inevitable even if it took a long, long time to take shape.Don't read more into this message than is intended. Most anyone who's had a stake in Apple stock for any length of time knows the organization has been cultivating other ways to drive revenue, knowing that iPhone sales would eventually hit a ceiling (even if they haven't actually done so yet). The company's "Services" division is the big growth engine for the time being.Nevertheless, much of the support Apple stock seems to stem from excitement surrounding the iPhone. If the company falters on that front, it could easily spook the market. It's a fight that's coming though, whether Apple wanted it or not.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Some of Silicon Valley's biggest private players-the so-called unicorns-have managed to put off public listings  thanks to a market awash in private capital.Exhibit A: Uber Technologies, which landed a staggering $3.5 billion from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund  in 2016. Yasir Al Rumayyan, managing director of the fund, is one of a dozen members on  Uber's board of directors.But amid growing questions about the kingdom's role in the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi  -Saudi Arabian officials have denied Turkish allegations that Saudi government agents murdered Khashoggi in Istanbul-tech's private funding strategy is getting a fresh look.And Silicon Valley now has a full-blown Saudi Arabia problem.The deep financial ties and chummy relationships illustrate that "the most idealistic companies in American capitalism-especially Silicon Valley in its rhetoric-are more than happy to take the dirtiest money on Earth to be bankrolled," Anand Giridharadas, author of "Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World,"  tells Barron's. "It is a hollowness when one considers damage down to climate change by Saudi Arabia, and its oppression of women."Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement he was "very troubled" by Khashoggi's disappearance. He's skipping a major investor conference in Riyadh  this month, dubbed "Davos in the Desert." But he had nothing to say about Uber's business relationship with Saudi Arabia. Uber did not respond to a request for further comment.But the debate goes beyond Uber, whose massive Saudi investment helped the company push off an IPO while pushing its private market value to $72 billion.The Public Investment Fund  took an estimated $2 billion stake  through secondary markets in Tesla  (TSLA) in August. And in April, the sovereign-wealth fund plowed $400 million into augmented reality startup Magic Leap.Magic Leap declined to comment, while Tesla did not respond to email messages seeking comment.Tech's connection to Saudi Arabia extends deeper, indirectly, through SoftBank  of Japan's $93 billion technology investment fund. The Vision Fund gleans nearly half of its money-$45 billion-from Saudi Arabia, in an attempt by the country to diversify its holding beyond oil. Softbank's investments include Slack, reportedly in line for a mega-IPO  in early 2019; food-delivery service DoorDash; and WeWork, a co-working space company."We are the creators of SoftBank Vision Fund. We have 45%," Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Bloomberg  in an interview this month. "Without the PIF [Public Investment Fund], there will be no SoftBank Vision Fund."The crown prince said he expected to pump another $45 billion into a new Vision Fund, with the intent of even more investments throughout the tech industry.Representatives for SoftBank, Slack, and DoorDash did not respond to email messages seeking comment. WeWork declined to comment.Saudi-based investment firms have directly placed bets on 11 unicorns, according to James Gelfer, a senior strategist at PitchBook. That list includes Uber, Lyft, and Magic Leap, as well as now public Snap  (SNAP).The crown prince is also courting American CEOs and billionaires to help him build a new smart city called Neom.    In a statement this week, Sam Altman, head of the influential Y Combinator tech incubator, said he would suspend his work advising the Saudis on Neom.    In a visit to the U.S. last spring, Salman also discussed the project with Amazon  (AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple  (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Google parent Alphabet  (GOOGL) co-founder Sergey Brin.The executives have been quiet on the topic this week. And while big U.S. firms have pulled out  of the "Davos in the Desert" conference, it will be hard for Wall Street and corporate America to turn away new Saudi money."Perhaps there will be some investor boycott of Uber, Lyft and Slack who have all taken Saudi money, but unlikely," Ann Winblad, managing partner of Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, tells Barron's  in an email. "There is still a massive amount of money for companies at a proven growth stage even without new Saudi money."Anurag Chandra, Managing director at NXT Capital, another venture-capital firm, is more blunt: "I don't see tech IPOs affected. There is Russian and Chinese money in so many of these deals." Corrections & Amplifications:  Ann Winblad is managing partner of Hummer Winblad Venture Partners.

 By Stephen Nellis Oct 18 (Reuters) - Satellite radio company Sirius XM Holdings Inc  is teaming up with Amazon.com  in its push into listeners' homes to move beyond its stronghold inside vehicles. Under a deal to be announced on Thursday, Sirius XM is working with Amazon to give three-month trials to some of its subscription packages when customers buy Amazon's Echo Dot smart speaker on the e-commerce retailer's website. The company's satellite radios are installed in 110 million vehicles, and the bulk of its 33.5 million paid subscribers come from deals with automakers who install the radios and often provide a prepaid subscription plan with the cost of a vehicle. But consumers are increasingly listening to streaming music services such as Spotify Technology SA  or Apple Inc's  Apple Music on devices such as smart speakers while home. To combat that trend, Sirius started offering a streaming subscription for smart speakers from Sonos Inc  and Amazon, as well as on mobile phones and laptops. What music streaming services offer that Sirius does not is so-called on-demand radio, allowing users to select which songs to listen to. To get into that business, Sirius earlier this month made a $3.5 billion all-stock offer to buy Pandora Media Inc, in which it already owned a stake. If the deal closes, combined service could rival Spotify in terms of market capitalization. The Amazon deal could give Sirius, founded in 2002 and controlled by John Malone'sLiberty Media Corp, a boost in visibility because Amazon will promote the service on its website. Amazon has sold 21.5 million Echo devices over the past year, research firm Canalys said. In a statement, Sirius and Amazon said that more initiatives around combining the satellite radio company's service with Amazon's Echo devices and Alexa voice assistant are expected later this year. 
 
 PARIS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Europe has talked long enough about whether to make internet giants like Google, Apple  and Facebook  pay more taxes and it is time for a decision, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday. Le Maire said the blockage was purely political and that all technical questions surrounding how to impose a levy on revenues earned on online services in the European Union had been dealt with. President Emmanuel Macron's government has led a push for firms with significant digital revenues in the European Union to pay more tax at source. Germany has long been cool to the idea, while smaller member-states with low corporate tax rates such as Luxembourg and Ireland firmly oppose the proposal.  Le Maire has said a small or medium-sized company in an EU country such as France, Germany or Italy on average pays 14 percentage points more in tax than Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple. The European Commission has proposed that firms with large digital revenues in Europe pay a 3 percent tax on their turnover on their online services in the EU. That would bring in an estimated 5 billion euros ($5.78 billion). Voters would punish mainstream parties in next year's European elections if the bloc appeared incapable of standing up to corporate giants and protecting citizens, the finance minister said. "It is time for Europe to decide whether it wants to become a submissive continent...or a sovereign continent," he said. 
 
TSMC sees modest Q4 revenue growth, shrugs off trade war impact
 By Jess Macy Yu and Yimou Lee TAIPEI, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC)  offered a modest fourth-quarter revenue growth outlook, predicting weaker sales of high-performance computers for cryptocurrency mining will partially offset solid demand for chips from smartphones. TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker whose clients include iPhone maker Apple, also shrugged off concerns over Sino-U.S. trade tensions hurting its sales, betting investment in advanced chipmaking technology will help cushion the impact. "Despite the current market uncertainties, our business will benefit from a continued steep ramp (up) of 7 nanometre for several high-end smartphones," Chief Financial Officer Lora Ho told the company's earnings conference. "However this will be partially offset by continued weakness in cryptocurrency mining demand and inventory management by customers," she said. TSMC forecast its fourth-quarter revenue at $9.35 billion-$9.45 billion, marginally higher from $9.21 billion a year ago. It warned the mid-tier smartphone market will shrink this year, but predicted premium phones will continue to show a positive growth, helping it ride out the slowdown, as TSMC mainly serves the high-end segment. Analysts said solid demand for Apple's new iPhone models, estimated from contract electronics maker Foxconn's revenues for September, will also support TSMC's growth in the fourth quarter, a crucial year-end holiday season for smartphone makers.  TSMC reported July-September profit of T$89.07 billion ($2.9 billion), in line with the T$89.0 billion average forecast drawn from 23 analysts, according to Refinitiv data. Revenue rose 1.9 percent to $8.49 billion, higher than the company's own estimate of $8.28 billion-$8.38 billion, as well as the average $8.4 billion estimate of 25 analysts, according to Refinitiv data. The results came after semiconductor industry bellwether ASML Holding NV, a supplier to TSMC, posted better-than-expected third quarter results and gave a bullish outlook on Wednesday, helping assuage fears of slackening demand.  Shares of TSMC, which rivals Intel Corp  as the world's biggest semiconductor firm by market value, closed down 0.8 percent at T$236.50 on Thursday ahead of the financial results, compared with a 0.3 percent fall for the benchmark index.

Apple (AAPL) Dips More Than Broader Markets: What You Should Know
 Netflix NFLX  added roughly 7 million new subscribers in Q3, which blew away its own third-quarter estimates by approximately 2 million. The big subscriber growth and the even bigger beat helped NFLX stock surge. So, let's dive into more of the numbers and take a look at how Netflix stacks up against Amazon AMZN  , Hulu, and HBO T  . Q3 Subscriber Growth   Netflix added a total of 6.96 million subscribers during the third quarter. This crushed its 5 million estimate and represented a new Q3 record. Netflix attributed its significant subscriber beat-which came after it missed its own subscriber projections by 1 million last quarter-to better-than-expected "acquisition globally, with strong growth broadly across all our markets including Asia."Reed Hastings' firm added 5.87 million new international subscribers, which came in well above its 4.35 million estimate and also crushed Wall Street estimates. The company closed the quarter with 78.64 million international subscribers and 73.46 million paying customers outside of the U.S.Netflix's international growth was impressive and will prove key going forward, but the firm's expansion at home helped to highlight the strength of its growing content library and its standing against its peers. The streaming TV giant expected to add 650,000 new subscribers in the U.S. Instead it gained 1.09 million to bring its U.S. total to 58.46 million, with 56.96 million on paid subscriptions.The streaming firm ended the quarter with a total of 137.1 million subscribers worldwide, which topped its 135.14 million estimate and marked a roughly 25% jump from the third-quarter of 2017 when the firm boasted 109.25 million subscribers. Investors should also note that Netflix closed the quarter with 130.42 paid subscribers, up from 104.02 million in the previous-year quarter.One of the key takeaways on top of the significant beats both at home and abroad was the fact that it reached record-setting net additions for Q3. This helps to prove that Netflix's days of massive growth aren't over, which is something that will likely excite investors and Wall Street. (The subscriber chart below comes from Netflix's Q3 earnings   release.)    Outlook & Competition Now that we have covered Netflix's third-quarter growth in this vital category, it's time to look ahead.Netflix expects to add 7.6 million paid users and 9.4 million total subscribers during the fourth quarter. These estimates would bring the streaming TV powerhouse's paid members to 138.02 million and its total subscribers to a whopping 146.5 million.Clearly, Netflix's subscriber growth showcases the strength of its TV and movie offerings. This was highlighted by the fact that Netflix ended HBO's 17-year streak  at the top of the Emmy nomination list, which is pretty impressive considering it only started making original content in 2013.Going forward, Netflix is set to launch more and more shows and movies, some of which will feature A-list Hollywood stars such as Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. These hit, critically acclaimed shows and movies will likely prove even more vital as Amazon continues to pump out big-budget shows and movies with even bigger names. Plus, Apple AAPL  , Disney DIS  , and AT&T are ready to introduce their own streaming offerings that will feature marquee names and historic franchises.    With that said, Netflix's 137.1 million subscribers worldwide makes it one of the biggest streaming TV firms. By comparison, Amazon Prime, which includes Prime Video, supposedly claims "over 100 million" members. Jeff Bezos revealed his company's Prime subscriber figures for the first time ever last spring.  Moving on, Netflix rival Hulu last claimed 20 million  subscribers. Meanwhile, not including Cinemax, HBO claimed roughly 30 million U.S. subscribers as of 2014, according to Barclays  . This falls well short of Netflix's 58.46 million and HBO was founded in 1972.With that said, HBO reportedly claims  142 million subscribers globally, most of which come through traditional paid-TV. Going forward, HBO is expected to grow its streaming presence through deals with other online players. But Netflix is also on pace to add 27.4 million subscribers this year alone. 5 Medical Stocks to Buy Now  
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSometimes identifying the best stocks to buy can be difficult, but you could do a lot worse than checking out the stocks selected by one of the world's savviest hedge fund managers - Warren Buffett.Buffett's stock picks are a popular source for investors, and for good reason. The billionaire Buffett is many things: He's among the world's most successful fund managers, a legendary philanthropist and owns more than 60 companies.Buffett's formidable stock-picking ability has given him the nickname "the Oracle of Omaha" and a fortune of more than $87 billion. And now we can track the latest trades of his $191 billion Berkshire Hathaway fund.Just-released SEC forms reveal a valuable glimpse into stocks Buffett likes (and the stocks Buffett doesn't like). These are the stocks he poured money into in the second quarter.Here I also include  TipRanks ' stock insights from Wall Street's best-performing analysts. Does the Street sentiment match Buffett's latest stock picks - or is he going rogue with his investing decisions? Let's take a closer look at the top Warren Buffett stock picks now:Editor's Note: This article was originally published on Aug. 17, 2018. It has been updated to reflect changes in the market.Apple  (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is now by far and away Buffett's largest investment. After missing the tech sector rally (Buffett recently admitted that he "blew it" by not investing in  Alphabet  (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) earlier), the Oracle of Omaha has been busy plowing money into AAPL.Following a 5% increase of AAPL shares, Buffett now holds over $55 billion in AAPL stock. This is about 24% of the total portfolio. Interestingly, it also means Buffett now owns almost 5% of Apple stock."I clearly like Apple. We buy them to hold," Buffett told CNBC in May. "We bought about 5 percent of the company. I'd love to own 100 percent of it … We like very much the economics of their activities. We like very much the management and the way they think."And the stock also has the Street's seal of approval. "Despite Apple achieving the $1 trillion milestone last week, we continue to believe Apple remains one of the most underappreciated stocks in the world with a valuation that remains depressed (13.7x our CY:19 EPS estimate, ex-cash)" cheers top Monness analyst Brian White ( Profile & Recommendations ).He added: "Now, Apple is heading into the seasonally strongest time of the year with a new iPhone cycle on the horizon." Indeed, White's $275 price target indicates big upside potential of 24%.In total, however, the stock has a "moderate buy" analyst consensus rating. This is with a $214 price target.  See what other Top Analysts are saying about AAPL.Minneapolis based  U.S. Bancorp  (NYSE: USB ) is the fifth largest U.S. bank - and one of the top 10 holdings in the Berkshire portfolio. Following the purchase of almost 10 million USB shares in Q2, Buffett's USB stake now totals $5.3 billion.However, Oppenheimer's Chris Kotowski ( Profile & Recommendations ) is less convinced. Interestingly, given Buffett's preference for value stocks, it's the valuation this top analyst takes issue with. He writes: "USB is one of the "super banks" of the banking industry, and while there is a lot to like about the stock, we think the valuation already embeds it."As a result, Kotowski has a "hold" rating on the stock, and tells investors to look elsewhere. "USB is not cheap on either a P/E or price/TBV basis versus peers; given the plethora of cheaper, high-quality franchises trading at a fraction of USB's TBV multiple, we think there is more upside potential elsewhere in the sector."The overall Street perspective also leaves a lot to be desired. In the last three months, the stock has received four hold ratings. This is versus only two more bullish Buy calls. Meanwhile, the average price target stands at $57 (8% upside potential).  See what other Top Analysts are saying about USB.Buffett has now ramped up his holding of this financial stock by 4% to $3.2 billion. This makes  Bank of New York Mellon Corp  (NYSE: BK ) the tenth-biggest stock in Berkshire's portfolio. Although Buffett has held BK since 2010, he began to pour money into the stock in 2017 with two 50% increases. Since then, it has been a constant build up.Analysts, on the other hand, are evenly divided between Hold and Buy. One five-star analyst in the bull camp is Vining Sparks Marty Mosby ( Profile & Recommendations ). He sees a compelling investment opportunity right now. "BK currently trades at a 13x price-to-earnings multiple, and we believe its expected earnings per share growth could reduce its multiple down to below 12x. We believe this valuation is too low for a bank currently producing 25% return- on-tangible common equity."He concludes, "As a result of earnings growth, multiple expansion, and a 2.1% dividend yield, we are targeting over 15% total shareholder return over the next 12 months."  See what other Top Analysts are saying about BK.At the end of 2016, Buffett shocked the market with huge investments in four key airline stocks. Only a few years ago, Buffett called the sector a "death trap for investors." However, with the industry fast consolidating, he decided to change his tune.Buffett's partner, Charlie Munger, explains "It (the railroad industry) was a terrible business for 80 years … but they finally got down to four big railroads, and it was a better business. And something similar is happening in the airline business."And one of the four stocks to buy that he particularly likes is Delta Air Lines  (NYSE: DAL ). A further $559 million investment in Q2 means Buffett now holds over 63 million DAL shares. This equates to a whopping $3.15 billion investment.Luckily, Imperial Capital's Michael Derchin ( Profile & Recommendations ) expects pricing power in key domestic hubs, improving business yields, and strong international results to boost earnings this year and next. His $68 price target indicates 25% upside potential.But Stifel Nicolaus' Joseph DeNardi ( Profile & Recommendations ) is by far the stock's biggest supporter. With a $95 price target, DeNardi sees prices spiking a whopping 72%. This top analyst has just calculated that DAL made at least $800 million from frequent flyer programs just in 1H18.Overall, DAL, a "strong buy" stock, has received eight buy ratings versus just a single "hold" rating.  See what other Top Analysts are saying about DAL.Texas-based  Southwest Airlines  (NYSE: LUV ) is the world's largest low-cost airline carrier. After initiating his $2.1 billion position in LUV, Buffett continued to up the stock in 2017. In Q1, Buffett ramped up the position by 10% with the purchase of 4.45 million more shares. Now the fund has a huge $3.3 billion LUV stake.LUV shares are currently rebounding after a tricky second quarter. Shares plunged in April following a fatal accident caused by an exploding engine. The accident - the first in the company's 47-year-old history - cost LUV over $100 million in revenue.However: "We have recovered at this point," CEO Gary Kelly told Bloomberg recently. "We have been enjoying very strong close-in demand and close-in revenue for a number of weeks."This chimes with Cowen & Co's Helane Becker ( Profile & Recommendations ) analysis. "Southwest will have a lingering impact from the discounting and a sub-optimal schedule, but the third quarter appears to be the inflection point as management does not anticipate continued issues into the fourth quarter."She keeps her "buy" rating on this "strong buy" stock with a $66 price target (11% upside potential).  See what other Top Analysts are saying about LUV.Buffett is also a long-standing supporter of top dividend stockGeneral Motors  (NYSE: GM ). After upping Berkshire's GM position by 2% in Q2, the fund now holds 51 million GM shares valued at $1.6 billion.While  Tesla  (NASDAQ: TSLA ) has been hogging most of the self-driving spotlight, GM is busy making its own mark in this fast-growing space. SoftBank Vision fund recently announced a huge $2.25 billion stake in GM's self-driving Cruise unit.Top RBC Capital analyst Joseph Spak ( Profile & Recommendations ) sees a promising long-term opportunity. This is even though GM has now lowered its 2018 outlook.He writes "It remains to be seen whether GM can win on the robo-taxi opportunity, but it has a seat at the table.

 By Angela Moon and Stephen Nellis NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Music streaming service Spotify  said on Wednesday it had taken a stake in DistroKid, a distribution service that allows recording artists to upload music across online stores and streaming platforms including Spotify's biggest rival, Apple Music. Spotify revealed the move in a blog post but did not give a dollar amount, saying only that it was "a passive minority investment." Spotify declined to comment on the size of the stake and other financial details of the deal when asked by Reuters. Unlike SoundCloud and YouTube, Apple Music and Spotify did not allow independent artists to upload their music directly to the service and required them to work through a distributor. That began to change last month when Spotify said it would let some independent artists upload directly to its service. Through the partnership announced Wednesday, artists who upload songs to Spotify will now be able to distribute those songs to "other platforms" through DistroKid, though Spotify did not say whether Apple Music would be included. Apple did not return a request for comment. The investment paves the way for Spotify to test out services that were once offered by traditional record labels such as distribution. If Spotify can charge artists money for those services, it could give the company an additional revenue stream beyond streaming music subscriptions. Spotify lost $647 million during the first six months of 2018, mostly driven by the cost of licensing payouts to record labels and artists for music. "They have an immense amount of pressure to get better margins. These (back-end services to artists) could turn into subscription services that could be new revenue sources for these platforms," said Jeff Ponchick, CEO of Repost Network, which focuses on distributing artists with followings on SoundCloud onto other music streaming services. Spotify stock  closed down 3.3 percent at $159.28 on Wednesday. 
 
Wooing investors, Rwanda hosts first tantalum-tracking blockchain
 By Clement Uwiringiyimana and Barbara Lewis KIGALI/LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Rwanda's mining boss announced on Tuesday the world's first blockchain project to track tantalum from the pit-face to the refinery, part of a push to woo investors seeking a conflict-free source of minerals. The project is the work of Circulor, a British start-up specialised in blockchain, and Power Resources Group (PRG), which has mining and refining operations in Rwanda and Macedonia. "Blockchain is one of the technologies that has demonstrated capabilities of providing a more efficient and effective way of delivering traceability for commodities," Gatare told Reuters. The Rwandan government is seeking to harness its mineral wealth to boost its economy, still recovering from genocide of 1994, when an estimated 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed in just 100 days. It is also seeking to fight off allegations its resources are being blended with smuggled minerals that can be used to fuel conflict in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo. Ray Power, chief executive of Power Resources Group (PRG), said since he first came to Rwanda in 2015, he had heard constant "criticisms on traceability" for minerals. Mining companies, which increasingly struggle to win investor confidence as the pursuit of opportunities drives them into high-risk territory, are exploring the potential of blockchain to mitigate any dangers. The technology behind cyptocurrency bitcoin, blockchain enables the creation of a shared database of transactions maintained by a network of computers on the internet, making it harder for anyone to tamper with than separately held records. In the mining sector so far, blockchain has been used by Anglo American  unit De Beers to monitor diamonds to help to guarantee they are free from conflict or child labour.  Projects are also underway to track cobalt, used in batteries. Critics of blockchain say, like any other monitoring system, it is only as good as the data entered into it. Tracking diamonds is relatively simple compared with creating a blockchain for an ore that has to be refined, such as coltan, which produces tantalum, or cobalt, because the refining process opens the risk of clean batches of material being mixed with other batches. Power said PRG was determined to be "an agent of change", with Circulor using GPS tracking and facial recognition to help prevent any corruption of the system. It also compares the amount of each batch of material put into a refinery from sealed bags with the end product. Power Resources Group's clients include Kemet, which produces tantalum capacitors for mobile phones. Kemet is listed by Apple  as one of its suppliers. Neither Apple nor Kemet had any immediate comment.

Apple Watch Series 4 Review: The Best Smartwatch on the Market
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile September's big Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) event was focused on the new iPhones, the real star of the show may just have been the Apple Watch Series 4.The latest generation of the company's industry-leading smartwatch was a true leap forward, not an incremental upgrade. Besides the usual performance improvements, for the first time since the original was released in 2015, AAPL boosted the display size. And the company also added new health features: fall detection and the ability for users to take an electrocardiogram on demand.As our Apple Watch Series 4 review shows, this new version has the potential to not only sell a lot more people on the smartwatch idea, it is likely to trigger a lot of upgrades among existing Apple Watch owners.A sign of just how popular this new device is: I pre-ordered an Apple Watch Series 4 and iPhone XS Max on the same day. The iPhone arrived within four business days, while the smartwatch took over three weeks.In the lead-up to September's event, rumors were flying that Apple had increased the size of the display in the new Apple Watch by as much as 15%.In reality, AAPL caught everyone off guard with a display area it says is over 30% larger. It uses LTPO display technology to prevent all those additional pixels from killing the battery.That 30% increase in display area makes a huge difference to the Apple Watch experience.The display still pops with its OLED panel and 1,000 NIT brightness. It's not just physically larger, but there are more pixels as well: nearly 165,000 on the new 44mm version compared to almost 122,000 on the older 42mm version. That means info can be larger and easier to read, and there can be more of it; one new watch face has eight complications running! It's also easier for those with large fingers to hit virtual buttons.You can see in the photo below the difference between the display on the 44mm Apple Watch Series 4 (right) versus a previous generation 42mm Apple Watch (left). Source: Brad MoonDespite the physically larger displays, existing Apple Watch bands are fully compatible with the Apple Watch Series 4. That's a big deal. Moving to a new iPhone with a different form factor than last year might mean having to shell out $50 for a new case. But some people have invested hundreds of dollars in Apple Watch bands ( Hermès bands for the smartwatch can go for over $500 each). Those can still be used with the newest Apple Watch.After launch, AAPL seriously boosted Apple Watch sales by focusing on the fitness market - a move not appreciated by Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) - but this time around the company is adding serous health cred. This is a move that has the potential to open a much bigger market for the Apple Watch , with health-conscious Baby Boomers a key target.The Apple Watch Series 4 gets an upgrade to a new, second generation optical heart sensor. I can't personally tell the difference, but Apple Watch already had the most accurate heart rate monitor and presumably this is even better.The key new health features are fall detection and an integrated electrocardiogram (ECG). Fall detection lets a users swipe to notify emergency contacts if their smartwatch detects a fall (using the new and more sensitive accelerometer and gyroscope). There's an option to have the Apple Watch automatically notify those contacts if it detects a fall followed by the wearer being motionless for a short period. While I wasn't able to trigger the fall detection, other Apple Watch Series 4 review efforts have proven that the feature works , at least when the wearer falls on a hard surface.The ECG feature uses a new electrical heart sensor to allow wearers to conduct a 30-second electrocardiogram that could detect atrial fibrillation or irregular heart beat. The ECG app needed for this feature won't be released until later this year, so I couldn't test it. However, it has big appeal to those worried about potential heart conditions as it can give the a heads up that something may be amiss without requiring a visit to a lab for a full-blown electrocardiogram.The Apple Watch Series 4 makes a strong case for being the best smartwatch on the market right now. It has a combination of health and fitness features that are unmatched, the ability to run apps, and a selection of first and third party replacement watch bands that is unbeatable.This model finally makes a strong upgrade case for owners of older Apple Watch models as well. The Series 3 added LTE, but the Series 4 with its significantly larger display, performance gains, upgraded sensors and new health features seriously improves the Apple Watch experience no matter what you're doing - all while still supporting original watch bands and coming in slightly thinner than previous models.Battery life may still be an issue for some (it remains at 18 hours), and it's still impractical to wear for sleep tracking, but the biggest knock against the Apple Watch remains its lack of support for Android. Even with the LTE model you still need an iPhone, for setup if nothing else.For iPhone owners, the Apple Watch Series 4 is the best smartwatch you can buy. For everyone else, it's the smartwatch that sets the standard.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s.The post Apple Watch Series 4 Review: The Best Smartwatch on the Market appeared first on InvestorPlace .
FacebookFB is increasing its security measures ahead of the United States mid-term elections. The company recently announced additional security measures to prevent voter suppression on its platform.
 Before 2016 U.S. elections, the company had introduced measures to prevent misinformation about "dates, locations, times and qualifications for casting a ballot." Facebook is now introducing additional measures as new type of abuses are surfacing online to tamper with election results.
 Now the company has extended a ban on posts describing incorrect voting methods and "statements about whether a vote will be counted" or not. Additionally, Facebook's new reporting option will help users report any false voting information.
 Authenticity of the reported information will further be checked by the company's third-party fact checkers. All the false posts will not be completely eliminated but will be ranked lower in the News Feed section, per Facebook.
 Notably, Facebook issued additional security measures after Senator Ron Wyden questioned Sheryl Sandberg about the company's measures to secure its platform from voter suppression techniques, per Reuters.Measures Taken by Facebook to Secure Platform
 Using machine learning technology, Facebook cross checks information, including photos, articles and videos, shared by its 2.2 billion monthly active users to detect any false information.
 The company also added more lucidity to political advertisement in order to prevent any interference in the upcoming elections to be held across multiple countries. All ads related to elections and other political issues on either Facebook or its photo sharing application Instagram will have to be labelled with the name of the payer in the disclaimer section.
 Additionally, Facebook announced a pilot program to help secure U.S. candidates and campaign staff from "hackers and foreign adversaries."
 In order to curb fake news, Facebook has been removing accounts allegedly spreading false information. The company removed 18 Facebook accounts, 52 Facebook pages and one Instagram account related to Myanmar military officials who were responsible for spreading false information related to the minority Muslim community.
 Moreover, the social media giant removed more than 270 accounts and pages operated by the Russian organization, Internet Research Agency (IRA), which were aimed at influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
 Facebook's efforts to plug security loopholes as well as limit fake news will eventually boost trustworthiness. Although the company's focus on building a strong "community" can hurt engagement over the next few quarters, the steps will expand its user base over the long run.
 Facebook is strengthening its security initiatives after the company came under repeated pressure from the U.S. government. Other tech giants like Alphabet's GOOGL Google and Twitter TWTR are also under constant scrutiny for their repeated failures to tackle user data safety.
 However, Apple AAPL is taking fairly good measures to prevent any data misuse.5 Medical Stocks to Buy Now

 By Stephen Nellis Oct 17 (Reuters) - Apple Inc  on Wednesday rolled out an online tool to users in the United States and several other countries to download, change or delete all the data that the iPhone maker has collected on them. Apple updated its privacy website with the tool, which was unveiled earlier this year for users in the European Union in response to the region's General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. Apple will now let users in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand see and download all information that Apple has collected on them. It also gives users a simpler way to make changes to the data, suspend their Apple account or even permanently delete it. Apple devices such as the iPhone or Apple Watch collect detailed data about users, such as whom they email, call or text message and even biometric data such as heart rates and fingerprints. But Apple's practice has been to keep much of that data on the devices themselves and encrypt it with the user's pass code, meaning that Apple does not possess the data and cannot unscramble it if asked to do so by law enforcement officials. Apple has sought to turn its privacy stance into a business advantage against its technology industry rivals, with Chief Executive Tim Cook saying that Apple "wouldn't be in this situation" earlier this year when Facebook Inc  came under scrutiny for the misuse of its data by Cambridge Analytica. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg in turn called Cook's comments "extremely glib." Despite its focus on keeping data on devices, Apple does collect and store some data about its users. With the updates to its privacy website Wednesday it is seeking to better explain those instances. For example, Apple collects data on users' reading habits to improve suggestions in its Apple News app, but it says that data is linked to an anonymous identifier, rather than a personal profile, and that it is not connected to its other services and can be reset at any time. Apple also expanded its guide for users on how to adjust their privacy settings. For example, Apple's default settings allow some advertising tracking in is App Store and Apple News, but it explains how users can limit that tracking. 
 
Russian high tech project flounders after U.S. sanctions
 By Maria Kolomychenko MOSCOW, Oct 17 (Reuters) - U.S. sanctions targeting Russia's nascent high tech industry have caused a Russian microchip company significant financial woes and delayed the launch of an initiative meant to produce substitutes for Western products, the firm's owner said. President Vladimir Putin has stressed the need to develop Russia's domestic tech industry to make it less dependent on Western equipment. But Moscow's efforts to manufacture Russian microchips and other high tech products have been thwarted by U.S. sanctions against a string of Russian tech companies. Reiman, Russia's former minister of communications and information technologies, said the company's inability to reimburse its debt was in part tied to U.S. restrictions on the import of dual-use technologies and its addition to U.S. Treasury sanctions in 2016. The U.S. moves were prompted by Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014 and its support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. It has imposed further sanctions against Russia since 2016 over other issues. Prior to the sanctions Angstrem-T purchased most of its equipment from U.S. multinational firm Advanced Micro Devices  and bought a licence from IBM  to produce chips. The company is heavily reliant on U.S. products, but the sanctions now bar it from doing business with U.S. firms. "Although we initially received the (U.S.) State Department's consent for this project and the delivery of the technology here, the sanctions caused the deadlines for its completion to be drawn out," Reiman told Reuters. "The factory is working, the products are being produced, but the question of procurement remains." VEB, which Reiman said could become the majority owner of Angstrem-T by the end of the year, declined to comment. 
 IMPORT SUBSTITUTION When Angstrem-T began producing its first chips in 2016 after nearly a decade of false starts and delays, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev depicted the initiative as a way Russia could surmount already existing U.S. sanctions. "It's good that we are starting to produce these ourselves," Medvedev said at the factory's opening, a month before Angstrem-T itself was targeted by the U.S. sanctions. "It's a question of import substitution." Reiman would not disclose the magnitude of Angstrem-T's debt. According to a Russian database that aggregates company data, the firm had 87.4 billion roubles ($1.34 billion) in debt last year. During the same period it recorded revenues of 101 million roubles. A source in the field of microelectronics in Russia said  the sanctions and repeated delays in the project had caused Angstrem-T's products to become outdated. The market for the 90 and 130-nanometre microchips it produces has significantly shrunk in recent years, according to the source. A draft Russian government roadmap for the development of the microchip industry seen by Reuters says that once VEB's takeover is complete, Angstrem-T should shift its production to the more modern 28-nanometre chips. Such chips are used in products made by companies like Apple, Samsung  and Sony. The ministry has for several years lobbied for Russia to build a modern microchip plant, but to no avail.

Search engine Baidu becomes first China firm to join U.S. AI ethics group
 Later this week,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) will begin taking orders for the iPhone XR, which   is positioned as the most affordable of the   trio of iPhones unveiled    last month. The iPhone XR will then ship next Friday. With as   strong as the iPhone XR looks -- it includes 3D facial   recognition, the headline selling feature over the past year --   there is   some cannibalization risk    because iPhone XR starts at just $750, compared to $1,000 and   higher for iPhone XS or XS Max.Even if the iPhone XR offsets some of the upside in average   selling prices (ASPs), it could help drive Apple to record iPhone   units in the fourth quarter.  iPhone XR is expected to be a hit. Image source: Apple.Widely followed Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo released a research   note this week (via   MacRumors    and   9to5Mac    ), and he has boosted his estimates on total iPhone units in the   fourth quarter. Kuo now expects the Mac maker to ship 78 million   to 83 million iPhones, up from his prior estimate of 75 million   to 80 million. The primary reason for the revision is expected   strong demand for the iPhone XR compared to last year's iPhone 8,   particularly in key markets like China, where dual-SIM support is   important.Kuo also increased his estimates for iPhone XR shipments in   the fourth quarter, which he models at 36 million to 38 million,   up from a previous forecast of 33 million to 35 million. Using   the midpoints of Kuo's estimates, that could mean the iPhone XR   ends up accounting for over 45% of the product mix. That would   also mean setting a new quarterly record, as Apple's current   record is 78.3 million units (Q4 2016).iPhone units will then decline sequentially in the first   quarter due to seasonal factors, but the iPhone XR's sequential   drop is expected to be smaller than other models'. In other   words, strong sales of the iPhone XR could help mitigate the   seasonal hit that all consumer electronics companies face coming   out of the holiday shopping season. With iPhone XR launching in   late October, pent-up demand could potentially keep sales going   for quite a while.Demand for the iPhone XS seems lukewarm, considering the   incremental differences with last year's iPhone X. The iPhone XS   Max and iPhone XR will be the real volume drivers, which will   have conflicting impacts on ASPs because iPhone XS Max starts at   $1,100 compared to iPhone XR's $750. Apple never directly   discloses unit mix beyond perhaps vaguely touting which model was   the most popular, so investors will want to pay attention to ASPs   to assess the product mix.  10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Here's How Amazon Is the New Apple
 When Steve Jobs released the first edition of the iPhone in   June 2007, he promised that   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) would "reinvent the phone" by putting three   devices into one (an iPod, a mobile phone, and an "internet   communication device"). His audacious prophecy couldn't have been   truer given where Apple stands today, thanks to the success of   the iPhone.E-commerce giant   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) is now doing something similar, and it won't be   surprising if it manages to emulate Apple's success. Let's take a   look first at what's worked so well for Apple over the years.  Image Source: Amazon.The massive popularity of Apple's iPhones year after year   helped it become the world's   first trillion-dollar company    in August 2018, just over a decade after the first-generation   iPhone was announced. This isn't surprising -- the iPhone not   only changed the way smartphones were perceived, but also put   Apple firmly in the driver's seat to take advantage of the   smartphone boom.Back in 2007, annual smartphone sales stood at 122   million units. Sales exceeded 1.5 billion units last year. In the   year leading up to the release of the first iPhone, Apple's   revenue stood at    $21 billion, a figure that has risen to a massive $255   billion over the trailing-12-month period.The iPhone has been the key to this growth, and supplied 56%   of the company's revenue in the third quarter. What's more,   the company cornered 86% of the smartphone industry's   profits in the final quarter of calendar 2017 despite competition   from more than 600 Android smartphone manufacturers.So Apple has not only managed to reinvent the smartphone, it   has ensured that the iPhone is successful year after year by   adding new features and building up hype with a solid marketing   strategy and flashy product launches. It has created a robust   ecosystem around the iPhone with new products and services such   as smartwatches, earphones, music, payments, and many more.So just one device brought about a sea change in Apple's   fortunes over the years. The company's smart strategy of locking   customers into the iOS environment, which came into being with   the first iPhone, and launching ancillary services around   the same has helped it strike gold in the consumer electronics   space.Amazon is now doing a similar thing by disrupting another   emerging industry.Strategy Analytics estimates that the global smart-home   market was worth $48 billion back in 2014, when there were 83   million households with smart systems. By 2025 the number of   households with smart-home systems is expected to jump to 293   million, boosting the size of the overall market to $155   billion.Amazon is on track to attack this opportunity by creating an   ecosystem of smart-home products based on the Alexa virtual   assistant and the Echo smart-speaker devices. Amazon saw the   opportunity early on and launched these platforms at the   end of 2014.Since then, Amazon has dominated the virtual assistant and   smart-speaker markets thanks to its early mover advantage. The   Alexa platform held 62% of the global intelligent assistant   market share at the end of last year, with   Alphabet    's Google Assistant being its only notable competitor. Similarly,   the Echo devices helped Amazon corner 41% of the global   smart-speaker market at the end of the second quarter of   2018.Smart speakers are central to the automation of a home: They   allow users to control thermostats, lighting, window shades, and   other appliances.Of course, Amazon's market share has eroded over time thanks   to the emergence of rival products. But just like Apple, Amazon   is adding new products and services to bolster it smart-home   ecosystem, which should ensure that it continues to make money   from this fast-growing opportunity.  For instance, Amazon recently launched a range of new products   to dive deeper into smart homes,   including a $60 microwave    . This appliance is set to go on sale in November, and it looks   like consumers have already signaled their approval -- it is the   best-selling countertop microwave on the e-commerce platform.That's not surprising, as the attractive price point makes the   Amazon Basics microwave basically an impulse buy, especially   considering that you can use voice commands to make it cook,   reheat, and even order supplies such as popcorn. It won't be   surprising if Amazon rolls out more intelligent appliances, such   as refrigerators that order groceries used on a regular basis, to   lure more consumers into its smart-home ecosystem.But it isn't just the big appliances that Amazon is going   after. The company's $25 smart plug aims to smarten up the   "dumb" devices in a home. For instance, you can plug your normal   lamp into an Amazon Smart Plug and control it through voice   commands. Some might say that there are a ton of smart-plug   manufacturers out there, but what sets Amazon apart from the rest   is that its plug eliminates the complicated setup process,   should play well with the Echo devices, and provides an   affordable route of making your home smarter.The smart-home industry is Amazon's next growth frontier.   That's why the company is going all out to build a solid   ecosystem of devices and services in a bid to lock consumers into   its ecosystem, similar to what Apple was doing with the iPhone   over a decade ago. It won't be surprising to see Amazon making   big bucks from smart homes for years to come, as it is going all   out to dominate this space.  10 stocks we like better than Amazon       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Expect Microsoft to Move Higher on Strong Tech Earnings
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe stock market has challenged investors for all of 2018. In addition to the effects of global saber rattling amid the U.S.-China trade war, Wall Street has seen volatility come back in force. As a result, we had sharp corrections in stocks, especially in the Nasdaq Composite . Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is one of the lucky stocks that is still up 25% year-to-date while others like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) are back to flat or worse. Momentum stocks like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) were hit hardest of late, but are still superstars up 50% for the year.This is a sad day for Microsoft since we learned last night that co-founder Paul Allen died at the age of 64. And here is the company, decades later, still leading the tech sector.Unlike International Business Machines  (NYSE: IBM ), MSFT figured out how to reinvent itself to thrive in the new-tech world where software-as-a-service is the way to present products.Fundamentally, Microsoft stock sells at a 27 trailing price-earnings, which is reasonable. While it's not screaming cheap, it's not bloated either and owning it for the long term is not likely to be a financial mistake. The concern is over the state of the global equity markets at this point in time. Sentiment has yet again flipped negative in spite of having favorable macroeconomic conditions.Companies are still making record profits and growing rapidly. Yet the fear of a correction still lingers thereby eliminating the appetite to rally from here. The absence of bids stock prices tends to stagnate or fall. Technically, MSFT corrected over 10% in 10 days. It has since bounced off last week's bottom. Microsoft stock found support at $104 per share, which is the start of a consolidation zone for the last three months. Those tend to be supportive as they create congestion on the way down. If that fails then $96 per share is the next zone to note.So this makes today's trade a blend of tactical and long-term investment. I want to be long the stock since it has a good set of fundamentals to warrant higher prices years from now, and still offer a midterm opportunity for some profit-taking along the way.I could use options to buy in-the-money call options or I could simply own the asset itself to eliminate the effects of time should there be more downside from this current sentiment malaise. The experts agree, since most of Wall Street analysts have MSFT as a buy, and the stock still trades below their average price targets. Unless the fundamentals there deteriorate suddenly I don't see any threat from surprise negative headlines.Microsoft will deliver earnings next week so there might be bit of volatility around the event. I could protect myself for the short-term with put options depending on how MSFT stock trades between now and then.Meanwhile, NFLX reported blowout earnings tonight. Because tech stocks tend to trade in unison, it's likely to cause a sympathetic move in the FANG gang and MSFT tomorrow.Click  here  for more of my market thesis and get an ongoing free copy of my weekly newsletters.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of  SellSpreads.com .

Intel's Latest Modem Gets Smaller
 Chip giant   Intel    's (NASDAQ: INTC) cellular modem business caught a big break when   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) decided to use its products in the iPhone 7 and   iPhone 7 Plus smartphones that launched in the second half of   2016. Since then, Intel and Apple seem to have tightened their   modem-related business relationship, with Apple   opting to use Intel's modems exclusively    in its recently announced trio of iPhones.In addition to this being the first iPhone product cycle to   use modems exclusively sourced from Intel, the modem that Apple   is using in these devices, known as   XMM 7560    , is the first to incorporate a cellular baseband processor   manufactured by Intel itself. Previous Intel modems were   manufactured by third parties.  Image source: Intel.I reached out to teardown specialists TechInsights, who   recently published a   teardown report    of the   iPhone XS Max    , and asked them if they'd be willing to share the size of the   baseband processor that's part of the XMM 7560 modem (called   X-GOLD 756). They were kind enough to oblige. Let's take a look   at that figure and why it matters.TechInsights tells me that the X-GOLD 756 baseband features   dimensions of 7.15 millimeters by 7.98 millimeters, for an area   of 57.06 square millimeters. In the table below, I've included   this data alongside the sizes of Intel's previous baseband   processors:Source: Die sizes from TechInsights, manufacturing   technologies from TechInsights and Intel, compiled by author.You'll notice that the X-GOLD 756 is about 19% smaller than   the X-GOLD 748 and about 12.6% smaller than the X-GOLD 736. Now,   you might be thinking to yourself, "Since X-GOLD 756 is   manufactured on a much more compact manufacturing technology, why   isn't it much smaller than its predecessors?"The answer to that question is that while the X-GOLD 756 is   built on a technology that's substantially denser -- meaning that   the area of an individual transistor in Intel's 14nm (nanometer)   technology is much smaller than that of a transistor built in any   28nm technology -- Intel likely needed to use far more   transistors to build the X-GOLD 756 than it did when it designed   its predecessors to support the enhanced features and performance   that the XMM 7560 solution delivers."The iPhone XS is a huge step up from the iPhone X when it   comes to LTE download speeds, according to exclusive new data   from Cellular Insights and Ookla Speedtest,"   PCMag    writes. (The publication did note that the iPhone XS' cellular   speeds still fell short of the   Qualcomm    (NASDAQ: QCOM) Snapdragon X20 modem-based   Galaxy Note9    , however.)Intel's next cellular modem is called the XMM 7660, and the   baseband processor that'll be part of that modem is probably   going to be called the X-GOLD 766. Intel hasn't disclosed what   manufacturing technology the X-GOLD 766 will be built using, but   according to analysts with Bernstein Research, the X-GOLD 766   will be manufactured using 14nm technology, just as the X-GOLD   756 is.If this is true, it wouldn't be the first time that Intel has   used the same manufacturing technology generation for multiple   products (Intel's X-GOLD 726, X-GOLD 736, and X-GOLD 748 were all   built using 28nm technology). It'd also mean that when   TechInsights does its teardown of next year's iPhones, it should   find a baseband that's larger than X-GOLD 756 is (notice that the   X-GOLD 748 was almost 8% larger than the X-GOLD 736 using the   same manufacturing technology).Another thing that's worth pointing out is that if the X-GOLD   766 is built using Intel 14nm technology and Intel wins the   entirety of the iPhone modem orders again for the 2019 models,   it'll need to dedicate more 14nm manufacturing capacity to   building baseband chips for the iPhone. The potential growth in   chip size in the X-GOLD 766 relative to the X-GOLD 756 should   mean that, all else being equal, Intel will need to run more   wafers to produce the same number of chips.Additionally, only Apple's latest iPhone models use chips   built using Intel's 14nm technology. However, I expect that next   year, today's iPhone XR will replace the current iPhone 8 and   iPhone 8 Plus (which use either Qualcomm chips or Intel chips   built using a third-party 28nm technology), leading to an   increase in the number of modems manufactured using Intel's 14nm   technology that Apple will need to support the next product cycle   (again, assuming that the X-GOLD 766 is built using Intel's 14nm   technology.)  10 stocks we like better than Intel       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

 Netflix NFLX  saw its stock price soar in after-hours trading after the streaming TV giant posted third-quarter subscriber growth that blew away its own projections by roughly 2 million. Netflix closed the quarter with 137.1 million subscribers worldwide, driven by impressive international and domestic growth. Subscriber Growth   Netflix, which fell short of its own subscriber projections by 1 million last quarter, added a total of 7 million subscribers during the third quarter. This blew away the firm's estimate of 5 million and set a new Q3 record.Netflix added 5.87 million new international subscribers. This destroyed its 4.35 million estimate and topped our 4.4 million NFM estimate. Maybe more importantly, the streaming TV giant added 1.09 million new subscribers in the U.S., which crushed its 650,000 estimate. Investors should be very pleased to see that Netflix was able to add so many more new users in the U.S., especially amid competition from Amazon AMZN  and increased market saturation.The streaming firm ended the quarter with 137.1 million subscribers worldwide, which topped its 135.14 million estimate and marked a roughly 25% jump from the third-quarter of 2017 when the firm boasted 109.25 million subscribers. Investors should also note that Netflix closed the quarter with 130.42 paid subscribers, up from 104.02 million in the previous-year quarter.Looking ahead, Netflix expects to add 7.6 million paid users and 9.4 million total subscribers during the fourth quarter. These estimates would bring the streaming TV powerhouse's total paid members to 138.02 million and its total subscribers to a whopping 146.5 million.On top of subscriber growth, Netflix saw its Q3 revenues jump 34% to hit $3.99 billion. Yet, Wall Street will likely continue to focus on NFLX's subscriber growth going forward with streaming platforms from Apple AAPL  , Disney DIS  , and AT&T T  all due out over the next few years.Netflix's subscriber growth also helps highlight the strength of the company's growing library of original content, which will prove key as long as it is in business.

How Much Are Amazon's Individual Divisions Worth?
Amazon's ( AMZN  ) business has two main segments - the e-commerce business and cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). The difference in the nature of these two businesses warrants analyzing them independently. Thus, we apply revenue multiples to each of Amazon's business divisions to arrive at a sum of the parts (SOTP) valuation for the stock.On a SOTP basis, we estimate the stock's value to be $1,500 which is 20% lower than the current market price, suggesting that one or both divisions may be overvalued on a standalone basis. In this note, we take a look at the valuation of each. Our interactive dashboard on  Amazon's SOTP Price Estimate    breaks down the divisional valuations. You can modify the key drivers to visualize the impact on the division's valuations.  Amazon's e-commerce business has two components - North America e-commerce and International e-commerce. The company's e-commerce business offers goods and services through physical and online stores, third party sellers and subscription (Amazon Prime). While the North America e-commerce business has been profitable, Amazon's marketing spending to fend off competition has led to operating losses in its International business. The company's total e-commerce revenue is forecast to grow to around $213 billion (+33% y-o-y) in fiscal 2018. Furthermore, growth from Prime members ( estimated at about 100 million  ) and Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods  is likely to sustain growth going forward also.The AWS business offers cloud based solutions for cloud computing, storage and other services. AWS continues to ride the cloud adoption wave, with revenues forecast to grow to $25 billion (+44% y-o-y) in fiscal 2018. Given the sustainable nature of the revenue growth in both of these business segments - at least in the near term - they can be independently valued on a revenue multiple basis.To estimate the divisional enterprise value, we apply an EV/S multiple to revenues of both divisions. The use of EV/S entails the assumption of a sustainably growing business, which is quite the case for both of Amazon's business segments.  Taking a cue from Walmart's acquisition of Flipkart and adjusting for relatively lower growth rates globally, we apply an EV/S multiple of 2.5x to Amazon's e-commerce business to arrive at an EV of $533 billion. For the AWS business, we derive the EV/S as the average of BVP Nasdaq Emerging Cloud Index of 8.5x to arrive at an EV of $214 billion. This gives us a total EV of $747 billion. Adjusting for the $2 billion of cash, we arrive at an equity value of $749 billion or $1,500 per share.It should be noted that Trefis has a price estimate of $1,655 for Amazon's stock on the whole. This is because the two divisions likely benefit from one another, leading to an overall valuation that is higher than our SOTP estimate. Do not agree with our forecast?

7 Dividend Stocks That Have High Growth Ahead
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe stock market has been a rough ride these past few weeks. Coming into October, all was fine as we recovered from the early February declines and went on to make new all-time highs. But with the Nasdaq falling some 10% in 10 trading sessions, investors are looking for safer stocks and that usually means dividend stocks.But balance can be achieved when looking for new dividend stocks to buy. You don't have to choose between high-growth stocks and no-growth income stocks. In fact, there are plenty of names in the market that are scattered in between.Zeroing in on these in-between stocks takes some work, but that's exactly what we've done here. We're looking for high-growth stocks that also pay a dividend.Specifically, we're looking for dividend stocks that have positive revenue growth expectations for the next two years. Further, we want names that have expectations for 10% earnings growth for this year and next year.Who made the list of high-growth stocks that pay dividends? Let's see.Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL ) has a management team that's committed to returning capital to shareholders. Given the strong economy, secular growth in air travel and plenty of free-cash flow that Delta generates, it's hard not to like this company.Making matters even better? The valuation.DAL stock currently trades at 9.4 times this year's earnings. That's despite forecasts calling for the airline's bottom line to grow 12.2% this year and another 15% next year. That's coupled with expectations for revenue growth of 7.9% this year and 5.5% next year.Those estimates also suggest margins are set to expand over these eight quarters, although rising oil prices may crimp that argument.Either way, at sub-10 times earnings it's hard to ignore DAL stock. Particularly when it pays out a 2.7% dividend yield, which got a near-15% boost in July, following a 50% bump in August 2017.Yield + growth + low valuation =  a buy in my book .Sticking to the low valuation playbook, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) is another dividend stock worth considering.Unlike DAL, BofA doesn't trade with a sub-10 times earnings multiple. However, it has superior earnings growth and only a slightly higher valuation. Estimates call for an impressive 37% boost to earnings this year over 2017's results. Even better? While that growth is forecast to decelerate in 2019, estimates still call for 14% growth next year.Oh yeah, that valuation? BAC trades at about 11 times earnings. Given its growth profile though, it's a worthy addition to one's portfolio. Plus, Bank of America just beat on earnings and revenue estimates for the third quarter.On the dividend front, the bank kicks out an annual dividend yield of 2.1%. The Fed's stress test results dictate how much a particular bank can pay out in dividends and allocate to share buybacks. Thanks to BAC's well-run operation, the bank upped its dividend by 60% in August 2017 and another 25% in July.There's a lot to like here with BAC - especially when you're looking for dividend stocks.What more can we say about Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) at this point? You don't usually see AAPL on a list of dividend stocks, but it shouldn't be surprising that the first U.S. company to hit the $1 trillion mark is returning a ton of cash to shareholders.A bulk of that comes from the company's buyback program , as evidenced by last quarter's distribution. $20 billion went to the company's buyback program, while roughly $5 billion went to the dividend. It's clear that Apple's management team has made it a priority to return capital to investors. That's why they gave boosted the quarterly payout by 16% earlier this year, following ~10% increases in the three previous years. Apple also announced a $100 billion share buyback program.Apple has been criticized by many over the years for passing on acquiring names like Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and even Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ). And while its inaction at times may be ripe for critiquing, it's allowed the company to amass a balance sheet stronger than many countries. It has also allowed the first $1 trillion company to appear on this list of high-growth stocks.Apple now has a well-oiled cash flow machine with its iPhone lineup, which perfectly ties into its Mac and iPad products. The Apple Watch has a clear role in the fitness and leisure space, as well as major potential as a medical device. Its Services unit is close to generating $10 billion in high-margin revenue per quarter, while rising average selling prices are improving AAPL's profitability.Apple built a legacy business and is relying on a faster-growing segment (Services) to boost its overall revenue growth higher. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is doing the same thing with its Azure cloud unit .The cloud-product solution continues to report year-over-year growth of roughly 90% each quarter. While that didn't move the needle a few years ago, it's starting to now and investors are taking notice.It's allowing Microsoft stock to command a higher valuation as it quietly marches higher to all-time highs. Analysts expect revenue to grow 11.4% this year and another 10.6% next year. More promising though is its earnings growth, which is forecast to increase 10.3% and 15.2% this year and next year, respectively. So like AAPL, this mega-cap is also a high-growth stock.Yielding just 1.7% and Microsoft is no longer best known for its income, although it used to be when the stock was a bit more sluggish. But it's up to investors on whether they want a 3.3% yield with little stock gains or a 1.7% yield and more than 38% one-year gains, such as MSFT sports now.If investors can get MSFT near $100, this is one of the dividend stocks they should pounce on.What is Boeing (NYSE: BA ) best known for? Beside producing aircraft, the first thing I think of when I hear the name Boeing is cash flow. And where there's cash flow, there's dividend stocks.Simply put, the company generates an insane amount of cash per year thanks to its well-run operation. Just last quarter, the company generated $4.7 billion in operating cash flow and bought back $3 billion worth of stock.It's a company that has thousands of aircraft in its backlog - 5,900 to be exact, worth almost $500 billion. Meaning that, Boeing essentially just works through what it can each quarter, churning out billions in sales and booking a tremendous profit for doing so.While a recession could derail this backlog and cause cancellations, most view the airline industry as a long-term secular theme. In other words, 12 to 18 months of a slowing economy (note: not collapsing) really wouldn't dent the need to fill orders that are still years away from being completed. Make no mistake, a recession will slow orders and hurt margins, but Boeing has so many orders to work through, it will always have customers.The company currently yields 1.9% and raised its dividend by more than 20% last quarter. This follows a 30% increase in the prior year.On the growth front, forecasts call for 42% earnings growth this year and 21.5% growth in 2019. Revenue estimates call for 5.6% and 6.8% growth during the same periods, respectively.A rally could push the Dow Jones even higher .Looking for a less-talked about name? How about A. O. Smith (NYSE: AOS ). The company produces residential and commercial water heaters, air purification systems and other products within that realm.And it's a big-time high-growth stock.Analysts expect almost 10% sales growth this year and 7.6% growth in 2019. That goes alongside forecasts for 20.3% earnings growth in 2018 and 11.3% growth in 2019. The solid growth profile has led to a number of consistencies for shareholders, like a steadily rising stock price and a consistent dividend.In fact, I've had this one as a Future Blue Chip  stock for years, but in 2018, it's had trouble moving higher. Unlike other years, it's been grinding lower throughout 2018 before the bottom finally fell out this month. Maybe it's too much like catching a falling knife for some, but those looking for a consistent company, they don't get much better than AOS.  
 Click to EnlargeDespite these losses, AOS remains solid as far as dividend stocks go. Just last week, the company gave a 20% boost to its quarterly payout, bringing its yield up to 1.85%. That follows a whopping 30% boost in January of this year, a 17% boost in January 2017 and 26% increase in January 2016. Clearly management is committed to upping its dividend.For investors who want a long position but are worried about a potential decline, consider buying near current levels and using a stop-loss on a close below the 200-week moving average (see the chart to the right).As much as I wanted to go with TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX ) right here, the stock's 53% gain over the past 12 months makes me leery on the name. Particularly as we head into what it is typically peak season for retail.Some will take issue with my selecting of Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ), as it's been "dead money" for a few years now after being on a big run of its own. However, the company continues to churn out record results each quarter and is a premium player in the fast-casual/retail sector.Further, the company is incredibly profitable, delivering impressive industry-leading ROI figures. Starbucks also has a huge multi-year growth opportunity in China, as the company continues to build out 500 stores a year in the country.Analysts expect 10.5% sales growth this year and just 6.5% next year. They also expect 17% earnings growth this year and 10% next year.There's a reason Bill Ackman likes the name .However, the big focus has become the capital return. The company continues to bolster its buyback plan, as SBUX recently entered an accelerated $5 billion buyback thanks to its big $7.2 billion deal with Nestle. By fiscal year 2020, Starbucks plans to return $25 billion to shareholders, a big increase from its prior forecast of $15 billion.Shareholders have gotten used to a 20% or more dividend increase in the October quarter for the last few years, cementing SBUX's inclusion on this list of dividend stocks with high growth. However, in July management gave an additional 20% increase to the dividend. SBUX now yields 2.6%.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell .

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn Friday, pre-orders begin for Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) third new iPhone of 2018, the iPhone XR.  With its combination of features from the flagship iPhone XS series, bright new colors and a $749 price tag that makes it $250 less than than the cheapest iPhone XS, the iPhone XR is the smartphone that could be a game changer for Apple. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is bullish on the new iPhone's prospects among upgraders and has now upped his estimates for the number of units Apple will ship this year by 10%.If he's correct, there is significant upside for AAPL stock, which never saw the expected "upgrade super cycle" with the iPhone X release in 2017.When Apple first announced the iPhone XR at its September event , there was a sense that the the most affordable iPhone may just turn out to be the one to watch.The $999 iPhone XS is an upgraded iPhone X, and the XS Max is just bigger - and more expensive. The iPhone XR offers the key features of the flagship XS series, including an edge-to-edge display, TrueDepth camera with Face ID, A12 Bionic CPU and the same camera as the iPhone XS. It has a display larger than the XS, and the best battery life of the 2018 iPhones. There are trade-offs, such as the use of an LCD display panel instead of OLED and an aluminum frame instead of stainless steel, but the iPhone XR is still very much a premium smartphone. Adding to the appeal, Apple is offering the phone in a range of bright colors.The kicker is the $749 price tag. That's less than the $799 Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google is asking for its least expensive new Pixel 3 phone.The potential is obvious.Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (via MacRumors ) likes the new iPhone's prospects. In a note to investors, he has revised his shipping estimates, citing better than expected demand . In particular, he spikes out the Chinese market. Here, he expects the iPhone XR to outperform last year's iPhone 8 thanks to its larger display, new form factor, long battery life and dual-SIM support.Kuo had previously expected Apple would ship 33-35 million iPhone XR units in Q4. He has now revised that to between 36 million and 38 million. Added to the iPhone XS series, Kuo is predicting AAPL will ship a total of 75-80 million iPhones in Q4.If he's right, that means overall iPhone shipments could hit record numbers (with obvious implications for AAPL stock). Last year Apple topped 77 million on the quarter , which was a 1.3% decline over 2016's numbers.The first quarter of each year is traditionally a slow time for Apple's iPhone sales. After the rush of upgraders and new buyers when the new models come out, there's usually a pause. That effect was felt strongly this year, with iPhone 8 shipments dropping 45-50% in Q1 2018.However, Ming-Chi Kuo feels the iPhone XR is going to buffer Apple against that effect next year. He notes:"We expect XR shipments to beat low seasonality in 1Q19. We forecast that XR shipments in 1Q19 will decline 25-30% QoQ to 27-30mn units."While part of that reduced decline can be attributed to the fact that the iPhone XR was delayed and is releasing a month after the XS series, Kuo also predicts there will be more demand for the iPhone XR as an upgrade from an existing iPhone than there was with last year's iPhone 8.Overall, he's calling for Q1 2019 iPhone shipments to grow 10% to 55-60 million units, with the iPhone XR making up fully half of those numbers.All good news for AAPL investors, but also all predictions. The iPhone XR is available for pre-order starting Friday October 19. After that, we should start getting a pretty good sense of whether the new affordable iPhone is going to a hot seller, or another ho-hum iPhone 8 level release.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s.The post Why the iPhone XR Could Be a Game Changer for Apple appeared first on InvestorPlace .
Your Post-Crash Action Plan for 600% Dividend Growth
 By Brett Owens If youaEURtmre wondering what to do in this panicky market,   IaEURtmve got a few aEURoeget rich quickaEUR words for you:   buy cheap, high-quality dividend growers with both   hands. I know thataEURtms easy to say, but overcoming fear is vital,   because history proves itaEURtms the path to serious wealth. I   can show you why in 2 charts. HereaEURtms the first one: A Snapshot of Terror   This is the CBOEaEURtms S&P 500 Volatility Index, which   captures panic in a picture, spiking when the market tanks and   dozing off when markets gently rise. When you overlay the VIX   with the marketaEURtms ups and downs, a canaEURtmt-miss pattern   emerges: folks who aEURoebought terroraEUR have ridden every dip   to big gains! When Fear Is High, Buy the Dip   Be greedy when others are fearful? You bet!(IaEURtmll have 3 perfect buys for youaEUR"with one of these   rate-friendly stocks boasting 600% dividend growth in the last 5   yearsaEUR"in a moment.)But wait, is this time different? After all, stocks-at-large   do seem pricey. I wouldnaEURtmt dive into an S&P index fund   today (trading at a rich 24-times earnings) just because the VIX   spiked.And no matter how many times President Trump says the Fed has   aEURoegone crazy,aEUR interest rates   will    keep rising. A December hike is baked in, according to futures   markets, and 3 more increases are likely next year:   Source: CME Group So what do we buy now?IaEURtmll answer that in 3 words:   dividend-growth stocks.    But not just any old dividend growers. We Need Dividends That aEURoeOutrunaEUR the     10-Year We want stocks whose dividends are growing   faster    than the yield on the 10-year Treasury note.Because why would you sit in aEURoedead moneyaEUR Treasuries   when you can grab a dividend thataEURtms doubling every 5 years   (or, better yet, rising 600%!)?And (for once) Wall Street (kind of) agrees with me.Just last week, the suits at Jefferies Group said the   following:aEURoeUltimately, companies with either high FCF (free cash   flow) yield, net cash and/or positive earnings revisions will be   able to live with long-term rates.   Companies simply offering a dividend with no growth will fare   poorly, in our view    [italics mine].aEUR Translation:    stocks with rising payouts and heaps of cash wonaEURtmt even   notice a slight rise in borrowing costs. The Proof A A A HereaEURtms the truth: if youaEURtmd jumped on cash-rich   stocks with fast-growing dividends 3 years ago, when this   rate-hike cycle started, youaEURtmd have demolished the   market.Consider the case of   Boeing (   BA    ),    which I   pounded the table on in December 2015    aEUR"the same month the Fed started nudging rates higher.The reasons?The result? Boeing shredded rising rates and handed us a   massive 206% total return in 2 years! 3 Dividend Growers to Crush Rising Rates But enough about past wins. LetaEURtms dive into the 3   aEURoenext BoeingsaEUR I have for you now:WeaEURtmll start by stacking them up by free cash flow yield,   one of the yardsticks Jefferies talked up last week. 3 Cash Machines   As you can see, all 3 are generating at least 5% of their   market value in FCF, with Marathon clocking in at 10%. Those are   terrific numbers. And the FCF backstopping them is soaring.

Apple Earnings: The Most Important Metric to Watch
  Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) earnings are coming up -- and lots of investors   will be watching. Scheduled for Nov. 1, the earnings release will   give investors a better idea of how sustainable the   company's reinvigorated growth rates are. Both Apple's revenue   and earnings-per-share growth rates have accelerated   recently.Adding to the pressure is the impressive performance Apple's   stock has seen. Shares are up 38% over the past 12 months.   Investors will be looking for a stellar quarter.While investors will want to check on   the usual items    , such as revenue growth and iPhone sales, when Apple reports   earnings for its fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 on Nov.   1, there's one key metric that may steal the show: revenue   guidance.Here are several reasons investors should watch Apple's   revenue guidance closely.  Image source: Apple.First, Apple's fiscal first quarter, which is the period for   which the tech giant will provide guidance in its fiscal   fourth-quarter report, is seasonally the company's biggest   quarter. This, of course, is due to the timing of Apple's product   launches and the holiday season. To highlight how big the quarter   is, 35% of Apple's trailing-12-month revenue came from the   company's fiscal first quarter of 2018.Since the period is so important, guidance for strong   year-over-year growth in fiscal Q1 typically translates to a good   year for Apple.Second, Apple's guidance for its fiscal first quarter will   give investors an idea of how the company's newest iPhones are   selling. Since the iPhone accounts for over 60% of Apple's   revenue, management's forecast for overall revenue is highly   dependent on what Apple is expecting from iPhone.The trajectory of Apple's revenue guidance relative to the   year-ago quarter, therefore, gives investors a window into the   general trajectory management expects from iPhone revenue.Finally, Apple's guidance will be watched particularly closely   this time around because the tech giant's strong return to growth   has given investors high hopes for the iPhone-maker's growth   potential over the long haul.Since   returning to growth    in the company's first quarter of fiscal 2017, Apple's   year-over-year revenue growth has accelerated for an impressive   seven quarters straight. Even more, Apple has now reported   four quarters in a row of double-digit revenue growth -- and the   17% year-over-year revenue growth the company posted in its most   recent quarter was its strongest revenue growth in 11   quarters.With such strong momentum in its revenue growth, investors   will be watching guidance to see whether Apple looks poised to   keep up its strong growth, but there're doubts about the tech   giant's ability to do so in Q1.If analysts are right, investors shouldn't have their hopes up   for guidance for another quarter of double-digit revenue growth.   On average, analysts expect Apple to guide for fiscal   first-quarter revenue of $92.5 billion, implying 5%   year-over-year revenue growth.  10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

  (RTTNews.com) - Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) apologized over the hacking of some Chinese accounts in phishing scams, almost a week after it emerged that stolen Apple IDs had been used to swipe customer funds, the Wall Street Journal reported. Apple reportedly said it found "a small number of our users' accounts" had been accessed through phishing scams. Apple reportedly said that the affected accounts were not secured with two-factor authentication. This allowed criminals to phish for account credentials and then extract money using apps like Alipay. If two-factor authentication is enabled, users must independently approve account access for new device logins. This greatly reduces the chance of phishing attacks ultimately working, as unknown login requests can simply be denied. For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com 
Huawei launches new flagship phones in bid to keep No. 2 spot
 By Eric Auchard LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Huawei  unveiled new flagship smartphones with novel smart camera and video features on Tuesday, as it seeks to sustain momentum among price-conscious consumers. The Chinese company, which overtook Apple  this year to become the No. 2 smartphone maker by units - behind South Korea'sSamsung  - introduced its Mate 20 phone series using Leica camera technology. The new line-up includes the Mate 20, with list prices ranging from 799-849 euros ($925-$983), depending on memory configuration. The fuller-featured Mate 20 Pro, is priced as low as 799 pounds at some UK retailers and list priced at 849 pounds or 1,049 euros across Europe. A comparable iPhone X Max from Apple costs 1,099 pounds in the UK. The new phones include a new ultra-wide angle lens, as well as a 3x telephoto lens and a macro that shoots objects as close as 2.5 centimetres (1 inch). Mate P20 models take advantage of artificial intelligence features built into Huawei's own Kirin chipsets. Features available to Mate 20 users include being able to isolate human subjects and desaturate the colours around them in order to highlight people against their backgrounds. Huawei incorporates bigger light-sensing chips than rival phones to take better pictures in low-light conditions. Gartner analyst Roberta Cozza said that in a highly commoditised smartphone market of look-alike phones, Huawei is managing to differentiate itself with camera and personalisation features. "With the Mate 20, Huawei is setting the bar for what users can expect from photography using a smartphone," Cozza said. The Chinese phone maker managed to surpass Apple to take the No. 2 spot in the second quarter, industry data shows, despite being effectively excluded from the U.S. market. However, Apple commanded 43 percent of the premium market and a lion's share of profits, CounterPoint Research estimated. "Huawei is clearly ticking all the key boxes needed to displace rivals - and not just Android-powered rivals," said Ben Wood, research chief of mobile industry consulting firm CCS Insight. Wood said Huawei's move to match Apple iPhone's characteristic swipe gestures and face unlock features on its Mate 20 Pro could, in theory, make it easier for committed Apple buyers to switch, although he said that was unlikely near term. "But it's clear that Huawei has an eye on the future and is ready to take share from Apple if the time comes that a loyal iPhone owner decides to try something else," he said. The new premium phone line-up from the world's biggest telecom equipment maker includes four models, the Mate 20, Mate 20 Pro, Mate 20 X, with a 7.2 inch display screen, and a Porsche Design limited edition phone.

Wooing investors, Rwanda hosts first tantalum-tracking blockchain
 By Clement Uwiringiyimana and Barbara Lewis KIGALI/LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Rwanda's mining boss announced on Tuesday the world's first blockchain project to track tantalum from the pit-face to the refinery, part of a push to woo investors seeking a conflict-free source of minerals. The project is the work of Circulor, a British start-up specialised in blockchain, and Power Resources Group (PRG), which has mining and refining operations in Rwanda and Macedonia. "Blockchain is one of the technologies that has demonstrated capabilities of providing a more efficient and effective way of delivering traceability for commodities," Gatare told Reuters. The Rwandan government is seeking to harness its mineral wealth to boost its economy, still recovering from genocide of 1994, when an estimated 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed in just 100 days. It is also seeking to fight off allegations its resources are being blended with smuggled minerals that can be used to fuel conflict in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo. Ray Power, chief executive of Power Resources Group (PRG), said since he first came to Rwanda in 2015, he had heard constant "criticisms on traceability" for minerals. Mining companies, which increasingly struggle to win investor confidence as the pursuit of opportunities drives them into high-risk territory, are exploring the potential of blockchain to mitigate any dangers. The technology behind cyptocurrency bitcoin, blockchain enables the creation of a shared database of transactions maintained by a network of computers on the internet, making it harder for anyone to tamper with than separately held records. In the mining sector so far, blockchain has been used by Anglo American  unit De Beers to monitor diamonds to help to guarantee they are free from conflict or child labour.  Projects are also underway to track cobalt, used in batteries. Critics of blockchain say, like any other monitoring system, it is only as good as the data entered into it. Tracking diamonds is relatively simple compared with creating a blockchain for an ore that has to be refined, such as coltan, which produces tantalum, or cobalt, because the refining process opens the risk of clean batches of material being mixed with other batches. Power said PRG was determined to be "an agent of change", with Circulor using GPS tracking and facial recognition to help prevent any corruption of the system. It also compares the amount of each batch of material put into a refinery from sealed bags with the end product. Power Resources Group's clients include Kemet, which produces tantalum capacitors for mobile phones. Kemet is listed by Apple  as one of its suppliers. Neither Apple nor Kemet had any immediate comment.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt looks like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) hasn't escaped its China woes after all. Goldman Sachs recently put out a note on Apple stock stock saying that there are "multiple signs of rapidly slowing consumer demand in China" and that this "very weak consumer demand" could lead to weakness in the numbers over the next few quarters.If Goldman is right and Apple reports unimpressive iPhone numbers over the next few quarters, Apple stock could drop in a big way. Why? Because Apple stock is trading at a big valuation. That big valuation is only sustainable if the company fires on all cylinders. Any missteps will result in weakness in Apple stock. Moreover, missing on iPhone numbers isn't just any misstep. It is a big misstep - and a big misstep at current valuation levels could spark a meaningful pullback in Apple stock.But I'm not so sure Goldman is right about this. I still think this iPhone upgrade cycle will be huge , as pent-up demand converges on favorable economics. In a world where Apple reports impressive iPhone numbers of the next several quarters, Apple stock will head higher.Nonetheless, investors should be aware of the risks. At this point in time, with tech sector sentiment already dampening and rates rising, Apple stock could drop in a big way if iPhone numbers fall short of expectations. As such, I think the best path forward with Apple stock is one defined by cautious optimism.Historically speaking, the valuation of Apple stock is highly cyclical. Apple has forever been a consumer hardware company, and year-to-year demand for consumer hardware products fluctuates wildly. As such, Apple stock's valuation on a year-to-year basis has also fluctuated dramatically. High highs are followed by low lows, which are followed by high highs again.Right now, we are at one of those high highs. Apple stock trades at 20 times trailing earnings. That is as high as that multiple has been in essentially a decade. Since 2012, Apple stock has traded with a valuation nearly this big twice before. Both times, disappointing iPhone sales and worries about smartphone market saturation caused the valuation and stock to crater over the subsequent several months.If Goldman Sachs is right about significantly waning iPhone demand in China, we could be on the verge of history repeating itself. Granted, Apple is diversifying itself away from being a strictly hardware company and now gets a healthy portion of its revenues and profits from the burgeoning software business. But, iPhones are still the majority revenue and profit driver. As such, material weakness in iPhone numbers with Apple stock trading at decade-high valuation levels could result in a meaningful pullback.Where could Apple stock go? Previous pullbacks of this nature dragged Apple stock more than 20% off recent highs. But, each pullback has lessened in severity due to Apple's product expansion. Thus, an iPhone related hiccup could reasonably cause a 15% pullback in Apple stock this time around. Recent highs were around $233. Thus, you are talking a potential pullback to just below $200.Although Apple stock could drop if iPhone numbers come in below expectations, I don't think iPhone numbers will disappoint.Everyone thought 2017 was going to be the big upgrade cycle. It wasn't. While the iPhone X checked off all the hype boxes, the $1,000 price point scared away most potential customers. After all, at that time, a $1,000 smartphone was unprecedented and ostensibly ridiculous, while edge-to-edge display was an odd novelty and facial recognition a "do I really need this" feature.Since then, though, $1,000-plus edge-to-edge smartphones with facial recognition have become the norm. If you don't have one, you feel outdated.News flash: because the iPhone X upgrade cycle wasn't that big, there are a ton of iPhone owners globally who don't have a $1,000-plus edge-to-edge smartphone with facial recognition. Thus, there are ton of iPhone owners globally who feel outdated. Normally, when consumers feel outdated, that is when they want to upgrade, so the desire for upgrades is there this year. Moreover, the global economy is healthy right now, so consumers also have the resources to upgrade.When sufficient resources converge on big desires, the result is robust demand. That is exactly what will happen over the next several months as consumers buy the iPhone XS and XR in bulk, and this dynamic will ultimately push Apple stock higher.Trading at decade-high valuation levels, Apple stock is not without its risks. But, at the current moment, the bull thesis is much stronger than the bear thesis, and Apple stock remains an attractive investment.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AAPL. The post An iPhone Slowdown Could Weigh On Apple Stock appeared first on InvestorPlace .
 By Toby Sterling AMSTERDAM, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Shares in navigation firm TomTom  slid 13 percent on Tuesday on news it had lost a contract with carmaker Volvo, renewing worries that Google's  entry into in-dashboard software may hurt the Dutch firm. Volvo awarded TomTom a contract in 2016 to provide location and navigation services from next year, but TomTom said on Tuesday that contract has been cancelled. Shares extended early losses after TomTom chief executive Harold Goddijn, on a call with analysts after the company announced forecast-beating third-quarter earnings, attributed customer defections to user experience rather than purely price. "I think it's on user experience, that's the key driver for [customers] making the switch," he said. TomTom shares were down 13.2 percent at 6.22 euros at 1435 GMT, while Amsterdam's benchmark AMX midcap index was up 1.5 percent. ING analysts said in a trading note that they believe the Swedish carmaker had switched to Google, rather than the current leading player in built-in mapping systems, HERE. "Now that Google is making inroads, the mapping business has become a three-player market with TomTom, HERE and Google, which is clearly less attractive for TomTom than the two-player market it was before," they said. A Volvo spokeswoman said it had not confirmed any new contract with Google, but repeated the company's statement from May that it intends to embed Google Maps in its next generation 'infotainment' systems. Earlier on Tuesday TomTom reported a rise in core earnings to 62.4 million euros ($72.2 million) from 35.5 million euros a year earlier. A company-compiled consensus had seen earnings for the quarter before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) at 41 million euros. Group sales were fractionally higher year-on-year at 220 million euros. While sales of the company's traditional satellite navigation devices continued to fall, that was offset by rising sales to carmakers and map licensing to customers including Apple  and Uber. The company raised its full-year revenue outlook to 850 million euros from 825 million euros. TomTom this month announced plans to sell its fleet management business, saying it would instead focus its energy on making digital maps used in highly automated driving. Goddijn said there was "strong interest" among buyers for the fleet subsidiary, which is valued at roughly 700 million euros.  He declined comment on what the debt-free TomTom might do with proceeds.

 There's been a lot of speculation about how   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL)  would eventually enter the streaming market   in a challenge to market leaders   Netflix    (NASDAQ: NFLX)  and   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) . Until now, Apple's programming efforts have been   modest, but reports suggest that the company plans to   spend $1 billion this year     developing original content, though how it would eventually   offer that programming to consumers has been unclear.The few shows that have debuted thus far have been free to   Apple Music subscribers. These early efforts have been   unremarkable, with widely panned unscripted series   Carpool Karaoke: The Series    and   Planet of the Apps    the only releases to date. The company ramped up its efforts when   it poached former   Sony     Pictures Television executives Zack Van Amburg and Jamie   Erlicht in mid-2017 to head its production team. Apple has   inked deals with some of Hollywood's elite to helm and star in   its original programming, but has yet to officially announce how   that content will be distributed.It seems we might now have an answer.  Image source: Apple.There are numerous reports that Apple initially plans to   provide its original programming for free to Apple device owners   via the TV app that comes pre-installed on the iPhone, iPad, and   Apple TV. In addition to its own content, the company plans to   sell a variety of subscriptions from other providers -- similar   to a strategy employed by Amazon Prime.Along with the multitude of movies and television series   included with their Prime membership, users have the option to   sign up for Prime Video Channels, which allows them to subscribe   to and watch a number of other streaming services like HBO,   Showtime, and Starz -- without ever leaving the app.Currently, Apple TV compiles content from linear TV sources   like ABC and NBC, while also allowing users to access existing   subscription channels like HBO Go, Hulu, and Netflix. As things   stand now, users must leave Apple TV to subscribe to these   services, but the revamped app will allow consumers to sign up   and view these subscription services without leaving Apple   TV.Apple plans to provide high-quality, family-friendly content   with broad appeal, and is avoiding topics such as politics and   religion, while shying away from gratuitous sex, profanity, or   violence, according   a report    in   The Wall Street Journal    . This move is designed to protect Apple's image and avoid   controversy that might adversely affect sales of its flagship   products.The company has penned a number of   high-profile deals    that give insight into its plans. Apple signed Jennifer Aniston   and Reese Witherspoon to secure its highly anticipated drama   about a morning news show. Renowned director M. Night Shyamalan   was tapped for a 10-episode psychological thriller, and Apple   plans to reboot '80's anthology hit   Amazing Stories    , a program that won Steven Spielberg numerous Emmys. The   new take on this iconic show is said to have attracted a number   of Hollywood heavy-hitters such as Clint Eastwood, Martin   Scorsese, and Kevin Costner. Apple also signed a multi-year   agreement with Oprah Winfrey to generate programming, though   specifics have yet to be released.Apple is spending big on these initial bets, hoping to find   several hit franchises that will form the foundation for a   streaming subscription service that will debut at some point in   the future.  John Legend and Alicia Keys in a episode of Carpool Karaoke.     Image source: Apple.With the more cautious approach being taken by Apple and its   late arrival to the streaming party, it doesn't appear that it   will represent serious competition for Netflix anytime soon. With   130 million subscribers worldwide and counting, Netflix isn't   taking its foot off the gas, with plans to release 700 original   series and 80 original films this year. The company's approach is   designed to have something for everyone, not favoring any   particular genre.There are those that believe that Apple's more measured   approach, while not a threat to Netflix, could be big business   for the iPhone maker. Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty   recently made the case that Apple's foray in video could   bring in as much as $37 billion    over several years.It's all rumors at this point since Apple hasn't made an   official announcement, but one thing's for sure -- you can't   discount Apple.  10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

     * Automakers, SoftBank rise after sharp declines on Monday * Retail faces double whammy of tax hike and weak Chinademand * Market awaits inbound tourism data due out after marketclose TOKYO, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei rebounded onTuesday morning supported by short covering in indexheavyweights, but Apple suppliers fell on worries about slowingdemand from China.   The Nikkei share average .N225 rose 0.8 percent to22,445.98 in midmorning trade, after tumbling 1.8 percent onMonday to close at its lowest level since Aug. 21. Traders said that Tuesday's gains were mainly due to atechnical rebound, as the Nikkei was trading 5 percent below its25-moving average, a sign of an oversold market.  Index-heavyweights such as SoftBank Corp9984.T and FastRetailing 9983.T rebounded, rising 3.2 percent and 2.3percent, respectively, after they were heavily sold on Monday. Automakers also regained ground, with Toyota Motor7203.T rising 0.7 percent and Honda Motor7267.T 1.4 percent. The overall Japanese market was dented on Monday after theU.S. Treasury secretary called for a clause to deter currencymanipulation in U.S. foreign trade pacts with countriesincluding Japan. While the index rose on Tuesday, traders said concern ontrade lingered and Japan's planned sales-tax hike pressuredshares linked to personal consumption. "There may be short-covering to some extent, but it may takea while for the Nikkei to fully recover its drops," said NaokiFujiwara, a fund manager at Shinkin Asset Management, addingthat the market has not factored in the impact from the tax hikeyet. On Monday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged to go aheadwith increasing the national sales tax to 10 percent from 8percent next October. urn:newsml:reuters.com:*:nL3N1WV2SB The retail sector .IRETL.T , which has faced the doublewhammy of worries about slowing consumption in Japan and weakChina demand, dropped 0.6 percent to a more than a one-monthlow.

 Shares of Netflix NFLX  dipped 1.9% during regular trading hours Monday just one day before the streaming TV giant's third-quarter earnings release. With that said, let's take a look at what investors should expect from Netflix's Q3 financial results Tuesday.Netflix fell short of its own subscriber projections by 1 million last quarter. This shocked investors because the firm had topped its own subscriber projections in seven out of the previous nine quarters, including four straight beats of roughly 1 million or more.The company expects to add 650,000 subscribers in the U.S. and 4.35 million internationally in the third quarter to help it reach 135.14 million subscribers worldwide. And our Non-Financial Metrics are calling for Netflix to add 669,450 U.S. subscribers and 4.40 million international members.On top of these key subscriber estimates, which will likely drive trading for some time, Netflix recently put an end to HBO's 17-year streak  at the top of the Emmy nomination list. And it looks poised to roll out even more new shows and movies, some of which feature A-list Hollywood stars. Netflix also knows that critically acclaimed content will help it stand out against Amazon AMZN  and soon enough Apple AAPL  , Disney DIS  , and AT&T T  in a crowded streaming TV market.   We can see that NFLX stock is still up big over the last 12 months. Plus, Netflix's Q3 revenues are projected to surge by 33.7% to hit $3.99 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. Meanwhile, the streaming company's international revenues are expected to climb from $1.33 billion to $1.97 billion, based on our NFM estimates.Moving on, Netflix is expected to see its adjusted quarterly earnings soar 134.5% to reach $0.68 per share. However, we still need to know if NFLX has a chance to top our quarterly earnings estimate.Luckily, we can turn to our exclusive Earnings ESP figure to help us. The Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter. The Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Netflix currently sports an earnings ESP of +0.71% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Therefore, investors can consider NFLX a company that could beat our quarterly earnings estimate. Investors should note that Netflix has only topped our estimates twice in the last five periods. But it is worth remembering that Netflix stock is likely to trade based on its Q3 subscriber results, especially in the short-term.Netflix is scheduled to release its Q3 financial results   after the market closes  on Tuesday, October 16.

 By Stephen Nellis Oct 15 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc  and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Monday asked a federal judge to delay a preliminary ruling in an antitrust case U.S. regulators brought against the mobile chip company in order to pursue settlement talks. In a joint filing in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Jose, they asked a judge to delay ruling on the FTC's motion for partial summary judgment for 30 days. Qualcomm declined to comment beyond the filing. Settling with U.S. regulators would be a turning point for the San Diego company, which has been defending its business model amid a barrage of lawsuits from large customers such as Apple Inc  and Huawei Technologies Inc, as well as dealing with regulatory challenges to its practices around the world. At issue in the civil litigation and regulatory disputes is whether Qualcomm's patent licensing practices, when combined with its chip business, constitute anticompetitive behavior. Regulators in South Korea and Taiwan initially ruled against Qualcomm, but it has appealed the rulings and settled some of them. In Taiwan in August, Qualcomm settled with regulators for $93 million and an agreement to invest $700 million in the country over the next five years.  Settling legal disputes will also be critical if Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf wants to meet the company's ambitious financial goals. Facing a hostile takeover bid earlier this year from Broadcom Inc, Mollenkopf said Qualcomm aimed to earn up to $7.50 in adjusted earnings per share by the company's fiscal 2019, a goal that hinges on cost cutting and patching up relations with customers and regulators.  Qualcomm has been able to keep the core of its patent licensing model intact, reaching deals with regulators and big customers like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd to continue allowing its practice of taking the cut of the adjusted selling price of a mobile phone in exchange for the use of Qualcomm patents.  The company has yet to smooth over relations with Apple, whose antitrust lawsuit against Qualcomm was filed early last year and has yet to go to trial. 
 
U.S. stocks  struggled for direction   today, before ultimately closing lower. Specifically, the Nasdaq ended lower as tech stocks weighed heavy, including FAANG member Apple ( AAPL  ). Tech also succeeded in dragging the Dow and S&P into the red by the closing bell. As such, and in light of a weaker-than-expected report on  September retail sales   , many traders sought safety in gold.

     In this episode of ETF Spotlight Podcast, I talked with Brandon Rakszawski, Director, ETF Product Development at VanEck, and Andrew Lane, Chairman, Economic Moat Committee at Morningstar.We discussed "moat investing" approach and the VanEck Vectors Morningstar Wide Moat ETF ( MOAT  ).The term "economic moat" was popularized by legendary investor Warren Buffett who said that he seeks "economic castles protected by unbreachable moats."In simple words, a moat is a unique competitive advantage that allows a company to outperform others in the same industry over time. The Morningstar Wide MOAT Focus Index tracks attractively priced companies with sustainable competitive advantages, expected to last for 20 years or more.Andrew walked us through the concept of economic moats and the different sources of moat. These sources include intangible assets, cost advantages, switching costs, network effects and efficient scale.MOAT provides diversified exposure to 40 companies with sustainable competitive advantages. Brandon explained how companies are selected for inclusion in the index.The fund's holdings include familiar names like Amazon ( AMZN  ), Pfizer ( PFE  ), Walt Disney ( DIS  ) and many others that clearly have long-term competitive advantages in their respective industries and  are also favorably valued. There are some "hidden gems" too.For example, not many investors have heard of Compass Minerals ( CMP  ) which produces highway deicing salt. We also discussed why Allergan ( AGN  ) possesses a wide economic moat. On the other hand, blue-chip darling Apple ( AAPL  ) has a narrow moat rating as of now, according to Morningstar. Find out more on the podcast.Healthcare companies account for almost one-third of the portfolio. The ETF is significantly overweight Healthcare and Consumer Staples and underweight Technology, compared with the broader market. The main reason for divergence in sector exposures is relative valuation.MOAT has outperformed the broad market since its inception in April 2012. We discussed why this investing approach is more suitable for long-term investors.If you want to learn about this ETF and other VanEck products, please visit vaneck.com  .Make sure to tune in for our next podcast.

 Last week,   Alphabet    (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary Google unveiled a new   lineup of hardware for 2018    , including new Pixel 3 phones; its first Chrome OS tablet, Pixel   Slate; and a new Home Hub. The Pixel 3 and 3 XL appear to be   great devices, particularly in the camera department. While   Google will never sell as many phones as Android leader   Samsung    , it's abundantly clear that Google is taking hardware more   seriously than ever before.The search giant also chose to take a page out of   Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL) playbook: It's jacking up the price.  Pixel 3 and 3 XL. Image source: Google.Starting at $800, the Pixel 3 is $150 more expensive than last   year's Pixel 2, which started at $650. Pricing has been the most   significant contributor to Apple's iPhone revenue   growth    over the past year, after the Mac maker priced last year's iPhone   X at $1,000. Apple stuck with that starting price point for   iPhone XS this year, and pushed even higher with the iPhone XS   Max, which approaches $1,500.But Apple is launching the iPhone XR this month, with   pre-orders starting later this week, at a $750 starting price.   Compared to the iPhone XR, the Pixel 3 may have a tough time   competing. Pixel 3 doesn't have any type of 3D facial   recognition, while the iPhone XR includes Apple's TrueDepth   camera system and Face ID. The iPhone XR's display is larger and   has thinner bezels, and comes in a greater variety of colors for   more personalization options. Apple's A12 Bionic chip also   utterly crushes the   Qualcomm    Snapdragon 845 inside the Pixel 3.Perhaps the most confusing part of the price increase is that   the Pixel 3 doesn't have any drastically expensive hardware   changes compared to the Pixel 2, which means that the price bump   isn't primarily meant to offset any cost increases. This is about   padding hardware margins.Last year, Google sold an   estimated 3.9 million Pixel phones    , according to IDC. That's a rounding error compared to the 1.5   billion total smartphones sold globally in 2017, of which nearly   216 million were iPhones. On average, it took Apple less than a   week to sell 3.9 million iPhones last year.There is an inherent trade-off between price and demand, and   there are plenty of compelling Android alternatives with   comparable hardware at much lower price points. That's why Google   adopting a premium pricing strategy is so bizarre. Google is   still in the process of ramping its hardware business -- reported   within Google other revenues at $4.4 billion last quarter --   and aggressive pricing is the simplest and most effective lever   to pull that will bolster unit sales. With higher unit sales   comes operating leverage, as the company could then spread out   fixed costs across more units.Instead, Google will artificially limit demand with an $800   starting price. It's almost like Google doesn't really want to   make that much of an impact on the Android market, which could   very well be the case, as it is competing with its own partners   -- the same companies that are the real volume drivers for the   platform. Perhaps Google is just trying to recoup   that $1.1 billion    it paid for HTC's smartphone team.  10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (C     shares)       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

  (RTTNews.com) - Paul Allen, who co-founded Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) with Bill Gates has died. He was 65. Allen died on Monday in Seattle from complications of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Allen's investment firm Vulcan Inc., said, "It is with deep sadness that we announce the death of our founder Paul G. Allen, co-founder of Microsoft and noted technologist, philanthropist, community builder, conservationist, musician and supporter of the arts. Mr. Allen died on Monday afternoon, October 15, 2018, from complications of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in Seattle. Mr. Allen was 65 years old." "I am heartbroken by the passing of one of my oldest and dearest friends," Gates said in a statement. "Paul was a true partner and dear friend. Personal computing would not have existed without him." Allen stepped down as an officer of the company in 1983 because he was grappling with Hodgkin's lymphoma. In 2009, Allen was treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which two weeks ago he said had returned.

Netflix NFLX saw its stock price sink during morning trading Monday just one day before the firm is set to release its Q3 financial results. With some on Wall Street worried about the streaming TV giant amid increased competition, let's look to see what investors should expect from Netflix's quarterly subscriber growth and some other key estimates.OverviewShares of NFLX have plummeted over 16% during the last three months after the firm missed its own second-quarter subscriber estimates. With that said, Netflix is still the largest streaming TV firm and recently ended HBO's T17-year streak at the top of the Emmy nomination list, which is pretty impressive for a company that first rolled out original content in 2013.Going forward Netflix will continue to launch new shows and movies, some of which feature A-list Hollywood stars such as Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. The company understands that big-name and critically acclaimed shows will help it take on the likes of Amazon AMZN and soon enough Apple AAPL , Disney DIS , and AT&T.SubscribersNetflix fell short of its own subscriber projections by 1 million last quarter. The company still added 5.2 million new subscribers in Q2, but the big miss was alarming compared to the firm's recent performance. Before the second quarter of 2018, NFLX had beat its own subscriber projections in seven out of the previous nine quarters. This included four straight beats of roughly 1 million or more.Netflix itself seemed unconcerned by the miss and hardly even offered much of an explanation, other than it had happened before.(The subscriber chart below comes from Netflix's Q2 earnings release.)Looking ahead, Netflix expects to add 650,000 subscribers in the U.S. and 4.35 million internationally in the third quarter. Netflix projects it will close the quarter with 135.14 million subscribers, which would mark over a 23% jump from the third-quarter of 2017 when the firm boasted 109.25 million subscribers.Investors should note that our Non-Financial Metrics are calling for Netflix to add 669,450 U.S. subscribers and 4.40 million international members, both of which come in above Netflix's own projections. Netflix had topped our NFM estimates for three straight quarters until its big Q2 miss.RevenueMoving on, our current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Netflix's Q3 revenues to climb by 33.7% to reach $3.99 billion. More specifically, the company's domestic streaming revenues are projected to jump by roughly 24.5% to hit $1.93 billion, based on our NFM estimates.Meanwhile, the firm's Q3 international revenues are expected to soar 48% from $1.33 billion to $1.97 billion. Wall Street will likely pay even more attention to Netflix's international revenues as that is where the majority of its growth is likely to come from going forward as the U.S. market becomes more and more saturated.EarningsNetflix stock is likely to trade based on its subscriber growth following its Q3 earnings release, which is due out after the market closes on Tuesday, October 16. But investors still need to know what to expect from its earnings.NFLX is projected to see its adjusted quarterly earnings skyrocket 134.5% to reach $0.68 per share. It is worth noting that NFLX has earned one downward earnings estimate revision over the last seven days.Netflix is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) based on its recent earnings revision trends and sports an "F" grade for Value and a "D" for Growth in our Style Scores system.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!

 In 2016, Kuriakose "Sony" Theakanath and Austin Chen left   their jobs at   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) to found Asaii, a music analytics platform that   was hoping to automate A&R (artists and repertoire), the   talent scouting and artist development operations of record   labels and music publishers, by using structured music data and   machine learning. Asaii said it could identify artists   months before they hit it big on the charts.Last month, Asaii abruptly announced that it was shutting   down, and it seemed quite likely that the company had been   acquired.It's been a ride! ����      pic.twitter.com/Atw6AZlhp6   Axios    reports that Apple has scooped up the San Francisco-based   start-up for less than $100 million, citing anonymous sources.

Asaii's third   co-founder, Chris Zhang, who did not previously work at Apple,   has similarly updated   his LinkedIn profile    and now works as a software engineer for Apple Music.Asaii had an enterprise product called Asaii Recommend,   an API that could connect to a music-streaming service to   algorithmically create personalized playlists and   recommendations. That's precisely what   Spotify    's (NYSE: SPOT) Discovery Weekly playlist does, which is one of   Spotify's most popular features and a strong differentiator when   it comes to content discovery. Apple Music's content discovery   tab, "For You," has some catching up to do, and Asaii will help   close the gap.

Earlier this year, Apple also started   expanding into music publishing    , which means it will want to bolster its A&R capabilities in   a scalable way. A&R has been evolving along with the music   industry, which has been rapidly transitioning toward   streaming.Here's Asaii's Ozair Khan explaining where the company   comes in (emphasis original):The role of record labels, and in turn A&R, has     paralleled this landscape shift, where record sales have become     less and less important, and revenue streams from concerts,     streaming services, and sponsorships have become more crucial.     Instead of simply choosing music that they may like, they look     for music that has been proven in the ecosystem- that     the people       like, to guarantee a return on their investment.However, even given this new path to discovering talent, the     sheer amount of artists in the music ecosystem and all the data     that accompanies them makes sifting through all of it     incredibly difficult- the data just     being       there isn't enough to ensure a statistically backed     chance of success.Apple Music is starting to catch up to Spotify in a big   way.  10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe recent decline of  Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU ) stock has created one of the better buying opportunities among companies that recently launched their IPOs.Roku, which manufactures devices for streaming and operates its own content platform, became public back in late September 2017 and had a strong debut, with Roku stock price surging 68% on its first day of trading. Since then, Roku stock has gone on to tack on even bigger gains. The market cap of Roku stock is currently about $6.5 billion.Despite the market's recent volatility, there is little evidence that the megatrend of cord cutting will slow down any time soon; that is certainly very encouraging news for Roku stock price. According to research from eMarketer , the number of Americans who give up cable is expected to surge 33% to 33 million this year. Meanwhile, the number of subscriptions to Over-the-Top services is forecast to jump by 51.7% to 170.1 million.Here's how ROKU's IPO prospectus puts it:We believe all TV content will be available through streaming. The rapid adoption of TV streaming has disrupted the traditional linear TV distribution model, creating new options for consumers and new economic opportunities for content publishers and advertisers.Let's face it: streaming is much more affordable than cable, allows for more choices and control, and has a tremendous amount of quality content.When it comes to leveraging this trend, ROKU has been very effective. In the second  quarter , the company's revenue shot up by 57% to $156.8 million and the number of hours streamed on its devices surged 57% to 5.5 billion.In a way, Roku stock is one of the rare hardware players that has been able to survive despite taking on the largest tech players. Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) and GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO ) show how brutal the hardware business can be.But ROKU has effectively leveraged its hardware business to create a vibrant digital content platform. In Q2, the number of the company's active accounts rose by 46% to 22 million. Roku has also been able to rapidly shift its revenue mix, as in Q2 its digital content revenue reached $90.3 million, compared to $66.5 million of revenue generated by its hardware segment.Even with the recent decline of Roku stock price, the shares are still not cheap, as they have a trailing price-sales multiple of 10.75. But then again, Roku stock deserves a premium, given the company's growth rate and its dominance of its industry. According to Parks Associates, ROKU has about 37% of the  streaming media player  market , versus Amazon.com's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) 28% and Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) 15%. Keep in mind that the market is expected to double by 2022.Besides, ROKU could ultimately become a takeover target at some point, as large tech companies would definitely like to get a piece of the streaming media player opportunity. That is actually the thesis of Needham & Co. analyst Laura Martin, who identifies a number of potential suitors, including  Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Verizon (NYSE: VZ ), AT&T (NYSE: T ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Amazon.com.And she also believes that Roku stock is attractive at current levels, as she recently boosted her price target on ROKU from $60 to $85, implying about a 40%+ upside from current levels.Tom Taulli is the author of  High-Profit IPO Strategies ,  All About Commodities  and  All About Short Selling . Follow him on Twitter at  @ttaulli . As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post Has the Pullback of Roku Stock Created an Opportunity? appeared first on InvestorPlace .

Safe havens rise on West-Saudi tension; stocks fall
 By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Major stock markets slipped on Monday as rising tensions between Western powers and Saudi Arabia added to concerns over the pace of global economic growth, with investors flocking to traditional safe-havens like the Japanese and Swiss currencies, as well as gold. Oil prices rose as the Saudi-West rift more than offset concerns over slowing demand for oil in the long term. Saudi Arabia'sKing Salman on Monday ordered an internal probe into the unexplained disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi as a joint Turkish-Saudi team was expected at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul where the journalist and dissident was last seen on Oct. 2.  The kingdom is preparing a report that would admit Khashoggi was killed as the result of an interrogation that went wrong, CNN reported, citing two unnamed sources.  Turkish police have audio showing Khashoggi was killed at the consulate, sources told Reuters.  Over the weekend, prominent business people including JPMorgan's  CEO Jamie Dimon and Ford  Chairman Bill Ford canceled plans to attend an investor conference this month in Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter.  U.S. crude  rose 0.48 percent to $71.68 per barrel and Brent  was last at $80.76, up 0.41 percent on the day.  "If the Saudis don't come to the rescue when the Iranian sanctions kick in... it's going to be a very under-supplied market. That was the fear that was initially driving prices higher," said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. On Wall Street, major indexes were mixed, with defensive sector stocks rising after soft retail sales data. Apple  was among the largest drags after a warning from Goldman Sachs regarding overall consumer demand from China.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 89.44 points, or 0.35 percent, to 25,250.55, the S&P 500  lost 16.34 points, or 0.59 percent, to 2,750.79 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 66.15 points, or 0.88 percent, to 7,430.74. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index  rose 0.20 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe  shed 0.45 percent.  Emerging market stocks lost 0.86 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  closed 1.11 percent lower. Japan's Nikkei  slumped 1.9 percent.  Washington said it would seek a provision about currency manipulation in future trade deals with Japan.  
 DOLLAR WEAKENS The dollar softened against major currencies after the weak U.S. retail sales data for September while Treasury yields were little changed after hitting last week their highest level in over seven years.  The euro  rose 0.14 percent to $1.1578. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.37 percent versus the greenback at 111.78 per dollar, while Sterling  was last trading at $1.3151, down 0.02 percent on the day. The Swiss franc rose 0.47 percent versus the greenback at 0.9866 per dollar. Turkey's lira  jumped 1.6 percent to its strongest since mid-August after Trump cheered the release of a U.S. pastor who had been under house arrest in Turkey. Investors hope his release can lead to an improvement in strained U.S.-Turkey relations. Saudi Arabia's riyal currency  was still testing the boundaries of its peg at 3.7514 to the dollar - its weakest spot rate since June 2017. Benchmark 10-year notes  last fell 5/32 in price to yield 3.1576 percent, from 3.141 percent late on Friday.  Last week, the U.S. 10-year yield reached 3.261 percent, which was last seen in May 2011, while the 30-year yield  hit a four-year peak at 3.446 percent. "The market will likely settle into its new range after the volatile trading of the past couple of weeks," said Boris Rjavinski at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. Likely pressuring yields higher, U.S. data showed the federal government closed the 2018 fiscal year $779 billion in the red as tax cuts hit revenues and the government paid more to service a growing national debt.  Spot gold  added 0.7 percent to $1,226.29 an ounce. U.S. gold futures  gained 0.64 percent to $1,226.40 an ounce.

  Apple AAPL  is leaving no stone unturned to boost its music service offerings. Per musically  , the company has acquired music analytics startup, Asaii, for less than $100 million, to bolster its position in this market.        Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM)    |      Apple Inc. Quote   Deal Benefits      Asaii's tools and technologies are capable of providing detailed   music data insights for music streaming companies.        With the help of machine learning technology, Asaii provides   artists with in-depth information about the impact of their music   on users through its easy-to-use dashboards. The feature will add   value to Apple's Music for Artists platform, which also allows   artists to understand the impact of their music across Apple   Music and iTunes.        Notably, Apple's major competitor Spotify   SPOT    recently unveiled a similar feature, which allows artists to   directly upload their work to the company's platform and see   music related metrics.        Additionally, Asaii Recommend can create personalized playlists   and recommend songs to users based on their listening pattern.   This feature can particularly enhance Apple's "For You" section,   which provides recommendation for users.        Moreover, Assai Score can identify upcoming popular artists at   the earliest by taking data from platforms like SoundCloud and   Spotify among others.        The prediction with a 70% hit rate, per Theakanath, may help   Apple gain a first-mover advantage, in terms of signing exclusive   deals with upcoming artists, over the likes of Amazon   AMZN    and Alphabet's   GOOGL    YouTube.     Competition a Concern      Apple faces intense competition from Spotify in the music   streaming space. Together, both the companies constitute nearly   80% of the total domestic music streaming market.        Spotify with a global user base of 180 million is way ahead of   Apple's user base of more than 50 million. Additionally,   Spotify's premium subscribers (contributed 90% to total revenues)   soared 40% year over year to 83 million, in the second-quarter   2018. This does not bode well for Apple.        Additionally, Amazon Prime Music and Amazon Music services, on a   combined basis are growing quickly, currently command 12% market   share, with 27.9 million subscribers globally at the end of the   first half of 2018.        Moreover, YouTube revamped its premium music offerings in June   and has added millions of subscribers since then.        However, Apple Music is witnessing increasing adoption as it grew   more than 50% year over year in third-quarter 2018and continues   to contribute to services revenues (17.9% of sales). Moreover,   with relevant acquisitions in the music streaming space, Apple is   expected to strengthen its position by offering unique and   advanced features to its users.        Apple currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see    the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)     stocks here.

On Wall Street, major indexes were mixed, with defensive sector stocks rising after soft retail sales data. Apple  was among the largest drags after a warning from Goldman Sachs regarding overall consumer demand from China.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 126.36 points, or 0.5 percent, to 25,466.35, the S&P 500  lost 2.88 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,764.25 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 4.89 points, or 0.07 percent, to 7,492.01. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index  rose 0.20 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe  gained 0.05 percent.  Emerging market stocks lost 0.72 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  closed 1.04 percent lower. Japan's Nikkei  slumped 1.9 percent.  Washington said it would seek a provision about currency manipulation in future trade deals with Japan.  
 DOLLAR WEAKENS The dollar softened against major currencies after the weak U.S. retail sales data for September while Treasury yields were little changed after hitting last week their highest level in over seven years.  The euro  rose 0.16 percent to $1.1581. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.29 percent versus the greenback at 111.88 per dollar, while Sterling  was last trading at $1.3155, up 0.01 percent on the day. The Swiss franc rose 0.40 percent versus the greenback at 0.9873 per dollar. Turkey's lira  jumped 1.6 percent to its strongest since mid-August after Trump cheered the release of a U.S. pastor who had been under house arrest in Turkey. Investors hope his release can lead to an improvement in strained U.S.-Turkey relations. Saudi Arabia's riyal currency  was still testing the boundaries of its peg at 3.7514 to the dollar - its weakest spot rate since June 2017. Benchmark 10-year notes  last fell 6/32 in price to yield 3.1633 percent, from 3.141 percent late on Friday.  Last week, 10-year yield reached 3.261 percent, which was last seen in May 2011, while the 30-year yield  hit a four-year peak at 3.446 percent. "The market will likely settle into its new range after the volatile trading of the past couple of weeks," said Boris Rjavinski at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. Spot gold  added 0.7 percent to $1,225.66 an ounce. U.S. gold futures  gained 0.76 percent to $1,226.40 an ounce.

It’s Time to Grab Barrels of Apple Stock After It’s Latest Correction
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe stock market has had an eventful couple of weeks. All year, traders have gotten used to seeing whipsaws from tariff war tweets, especially with China. But this time the dip was a redux of the January correction.In the last few weeks fear rose over rising rates. This came about from an overheated jobs report, but this time, Chairman Powell, the head of the U.S. Federal reserve was the bigger factor. He sounded too optimistic about the economy. So traders interpreted his words as a commitment to overshooting in the rate tightening cycle.Higher rates usually result in less money available for driving the stock markets higher. But therein lies the opportunity.The fear is overblown at this point in time. I am more inclined to take his words at face value that things are looking great for the U.S. economy. This is evident in the company profit and loss statements.Take  Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) for example. This is a company that delivers on profitability, growth and pays a dividend to boot. And under the current macroeconomic conditions, this is likely to continue. I just don't see it correcting too harshly from here. Apple stock has already fallen 9% from the highs to last week's low. But this is merely a halfback check from its breakout on its July earnings report.Speaking of earnings, we're about to start another round of tech earnings. And I believe Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) will be a trigger for the mega-cap tech sector. I say this because it will cause a sympathetic move in the rest of the "FANG" gang. If Netflix rallies then Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ),  Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) are likely to follow. And often Apple and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) follow NFLX as well.Those companies combined account for more than half of the Nasdaq Composite index. The AAPL stock price stands on its own merit, but the short-term reaction will be more emotional than logical.AAPL is a gem but in the wrong hands. I have not been a fan of Tim Cook as a leader for the best company on the planet. But even though he hasn't shown the same ingenuity as Steve Jobs, I still believe he has an unbelievable asset in Apple, so it is almost impossible for him to mess it up in the short-term.I believe that eventually they will stumble on a another cash cow other than the iPhone. It may even be a service of sorts or maybe a software overlay. But nevertheless, the future for Apple stock is as certain as can be. It will be higher in the future than the current AAPL stock price.I hear experts say that one should own Apple stock and not trade it. Ideally, I would rather enter long closer to $196 per share. And we might get that in the next couple of months. But I want to nibble long at this level.This will be a long-term hold rather than a tactical trade. I can accomplish this by buying the shares outright, or I can use the options market to buy in the money calls.Using options puts less money out of pocket risk. But in either case, I'm a fan of using options to generate synthetic dividends. So I would sell covered calls against either long Apple stock or calls.The Netflix earnings will be a hard test for AAPL. On its last report, Wall Street punished Netflix very hard. But I don't believe management misses two quarters in a row. If they do, I expect my long Apple position to also be tested hard in the short term.There is also risk from the overall Market sentiment. Current rhetoric has built up fear of corrections but those are not imminent in my opinion. Sentiment can be swayed in either direction, all the bulls need is for the current headlines to go stale. But for the meantime, the U.S. is an a economic war with China and until the leaders sit down and start talking rationally the nervousness on Wall Street will linger.Click  here  for more of my market thesis and get an ongoing free copy of my weekly newsletters.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of  SellSpreads.com .

In early trading on Monday, shares of JPMorgan Chase ( JPM  ) topped the list of the day's best performing Dow Jones Industrial Average components, trading up 1.4%. Year to date, JPMorgan Chase registers a 1.4% gain.          VIDEO: Dow Movers: PFE, JPM  
 By Medha Singh Oct 15 (Reuters) - A drop in technology stocks on Monday kept pressure on Wall Street and led the Nasdaq lower, but the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out slim gains as defensive sectors rose, while traders also pointed to technical support. Apple  fell 1.5 percent and weighed the most on the three major indexes after Goldman Sachs said there were multiple signs of rapidly slowing consumer demand in China, which could affect demand for iPhones this fall. "It's almost as if a ceasefire has been called in the market between the bulls and the bears. There is hesitation to make a move in either direction right now and the best term to describe it is probably 'nervous,'" said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. Wall Street is coming off a steep selloff last week, its worst in seven months, on mounting fears about the impact of tariffs and rising borrowing costs on corporate profits, with the third-quarter earnings season kicking into high gear this week. Profit growth at S&P companies is expected to have slowed, to 21.6 percent, compared with the past two quarters, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. The first major earnings report this week was also not well received. Bank of America  dropped 1.4 percent after its loan growth lagged rivals, and fees from advising on deals and underwriting bonds fell in the third quarter.  Also adding to nerves was the rising tension between Western powers and Saudi Arabia over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Saudi Arabia holds stakes in big U.S. companies and also finances SoftBank Group'sVision Fund, the world's largest technology investment vehicle. Antonelli also said the S&P was getting some support from its 200-day moving average, a key indicator of long-term momentum, of 2,766.56 points, which the "bulls are trying to defend". The Dow was holding near its 100-day moving average. At 1:40 p.m. ET, the S&P 500  was up 3.07 points, or 0.11 percent, at 2,770.20. The Dow  was up 72.45 points, or 0.29 percent, at 25,412.44, while the Nasdaq Composite  was down 17.98 points, or 0.24 percent, at 7,478.91. Helping the Dow was Walt Disney's  1.7 percent rise. The company has offered concessions in an attempt to allay EU antitrust concerns over its $71.3 billion bid for Twenty-First Century Fox's  entertainment assets. Fox rose 0.7 percent.  The top gainers on the S&P were L3 Technologies, which jumped 11.9 percent, and Harris Corp, which climbed 10.9 percent, after the military communication equipment providers announced an all-stock merger to create the sixth-largest U.S. defense contractor.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 1.87-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.31-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded two new 52-week highs and seven new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 11 new highs and 125 new lows.

Wall Street closed sharply higher on Friday buoyed by a strong rebound in tech stocks. This also enabled U.S. stock markets to partially recover from the rout it faced over the past two days. All three major stock indexes ended in positive territory but closed in the red for the week. However, quarterly earnings results of major banks failed to boost investors' sentiment.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 25,339.99, gaining 1.2% or 287.16 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 1.4% to close at 2,767.13. The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,496.89, surging 2.3%. A total of 8.91 billion shares were traded on Friday, higher than the last 20-session average of 7.78 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1.38-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, advancers had an edge over decliners by 1.51-to-1 ratio.  The CBOE VIX decreased 14.7% to close at 21.31.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow ended in positive territory after three straight closes in the red. The index partially lost out on an intraday gain of 414.72 points and finally recoups 287.16 points. Meanwhile, 26 components of the 30-stock index finished in the green while four ended in the red.The S&P 500 also closed in positive territory after snapping a six-day losing streak, its longest since November 2016. The benchmark index's recovery was led by a jump of 3.2% in the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK), 2.2% surge in Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC), a 1.9% gain in Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) and a 1.5% rise in Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV). Notably, nine out of 11 sectors of the broader market index finished in the green while two closed in the red.The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite finished in the green after its two consecutive days of losses due to strong showing by FAANG stocks. Friday's gain was the biggest single-day rise for the tech-heavy index since Mar 26.Technology Sector Leads Wall Street's Partial RecoveryU.S. stock markets witnessed this year's most disastrous performance last week. Technology stocks were hard hit during a market rout as investors' worried about the lofty valuation of the sector. However, intrinsic value of the sector remained very firm and a steady fall of share prices of major large-cap stocks has given investors an opportunity to enter the market.Consequently, shares of Apple Inc. AAPL , Netflix Inc. NFLX and Microsoft Corp. MSFT rose 3.6%, 5.8% and 3.5%, respectively.Major Banks Beat Expectations but Failed to Lift MarketJPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM posted strong third quarter results herein both the top and bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the stock declined 1.1% as investors remained concern about the bank's future earnings growth in view of a 10% decline in fixed income trading revenues and a 16% fall in mortgage business.

Consequently, the share price of Citigroup climbed 2.1%. ( Read More )Wells Fargo & Co.'s WFC quarterly adjusted earnings per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to reduced fee income while total revenue was in line with it. Despite missing the bottom line, the stock gained 1.3% primarily due to an improvement of its credit quality and impressive cost control in the reported quarter. ( Read More )Economic DataThe Department of Labor reported that U.S. import price index for the month of September increased 0.5%, higher than the consensus estimate of an increase of 0.2%. Meanwhile, U.S. export price index for the month of September remained flat with the previous month but the consensus estimate was for an increment of 0.1%.University of Michigan reported that the preliminary reading of the U.S. consumer sentiment index for the month of October was 99, lower than the September's reading of 100.1. The consensus estimate was for a reading of 100.3.Weekly RoundupThe second week of October was the worst one for Wall Street since March. All three major stock indexes - The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite - declined 4.2%, 4.1% and 3.7%, respectively. For both the Dow 30 and S&P 500, it was the third straight weekly losses while Nasdaq Composite posted its second successive weekly loss. Notably, the S&P 500 posted its longest weekly drop since the Brexit referendum in June 2016. Consequently, Cboe Volatility index (VIX) reached its highest level since February.Last week's market mayhem started due to spike in the yields of 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury Notes buoyed by a series of strong economic data. However, higher yields and an indication from the Fed Chair that a rate hike was likely in December made investor's nervous resulting in panic selling of equities across the board.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo most consumers as well as most investors, the news would have meant very little. Software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is joining the Open Invention Network (OIN), allowing free use of more than 60,000 patents for developers that code apps and programs for the open source operating system called Linux. But, in that relatively few people are familiar with Linux and its nuances, current and prospective owners of Microsoft stock were unsure why it mattered.However, it's a far bigger deal than it may seem on the surface - even if it's still not entirely clear how - as it marks a radical evolution not just for Microsoft, but for the entire computing arena.For perspective, Linux is the same operating system former Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer called a "cancer" back in 2001 . Now the company is earnestly supporting its expansion. What a difference a few years can make.But what is Linux? It's an operating system, not unlike Windows, but not like it either. There are consumer-facing versions of it, though it has been a highly appreciated option within the tech-development world where flexibility and customization are crucial.That's where the term "open source" comes in. Not only is open source software free of charge (though not all custom-written tools and apps are), its underlying code is readily evident so programmers can see and tweak things for themselves. Microsoft's Windows and iOS from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) weren't and aren't exactly developer-friendly.By joining the OIN, Microsoft not only acquiesces to an idea it resisted for years, but encourages free and open use of intellectual property that could seemingly crimp its top and bottom lines. Other Open Invention Network members, including powerhouses like International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) can now use Microsoft's patented technologies regarding Linux without fear of legal retribution.The $64,000 question is, why?There's more than one plausible answer, but in the most basic sense, Corporate Vice President and Deputy General Counsel Erich Andersen's explanation held water. He said the decision is "the next logical step for a company that is listening to customers and developers and is firmly committed to Linux and other open source programs." Anderson added,"developers do not want a binary choice between Windows vs. Linux, or .NET vs Java - they want cloud platforms to support all technologies. They want to deploy technologies at the edge - on any device - that meet customer needs. We also learned that collaborative development through the open source process can accelerate innovation."Translation: There's money to be made by rethinking this sliver of the company's business model.That said, there may be a less generous and less altruistic motivation as well. Abhishek Prakash , programmer and self-proclaimed Linux fan, wrote of the decision , "Microsoft has its own selfish interest in this case. This time around it is more about protecting Microsoft and its cloud business on Azure that depends heavily on Linux. Remember Oracle vs Google legal battle over the use of Java in the Android operating system? If Linux ever gets into patent battle and loses it, all the companies using Linux might have to pay billions. Microsoft surely doesn't want to be in such a situation and hence it (along with many other big corporations) wants to protect Linux in order to save its own back."A great deal of Microsoft's relatively new cloud computing business is already built on a Linux-based foundation.While clearly developer-friendly, it's a maneuver that understandably has raised the eyebrows of Microsoft stock holders. Why give away what could be sold? Microsoft has already collected several billion dollars' worth of patent royalties related to the Android smartphone operating system (which is a Linux-based system) that will now, presumably, no longer command revenue.A great number of smaller royalty revenue streams may also be going away.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella isn't dumb though. He sees the tidal shift underway in the world of computing. Defensible walls and isolated computing environments are no longer the norm. Operating systems are no longer a key profit center in and of themselves. Partnerships and co-development are the norm, and operating systems are a means to creating other revenue streams. In Microsoft's case, it has a chance to make even more money by allowing its Azure cloud computing platform to become even more user friendly.Again, it's still not clear exactly what sort of fiscal impact the new-found support of Linux will make … perhaps not even to Microsoft. It was the inevitable shape of things to come though. Better for the company to pull the trigger now, on its terms, and help shape what the OIN is than be forced to join the OIN on someone else's terms at a later date.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Among the biggest drag on the three major indexes was AppleAAPL.O , which fell 1.6 percent after Goldman Sachs said therewere multiple signs of rapidly slowing consumer demand in China,which could affect demand for iPhones this fall. Apple's drop weighed on technology stocks .SPLRCT , whichfell 1.34 percent and much like last week, led the market lower.The gainers among the 11 major S&P sectors were led by thedefensive utilities, real estate and consumer staples companies.    With the third-quarter earnings season entering high gearthis week, Goldman's warning on weak demand from China wouldonly add to fears about the impact of the U.S.-China trade waron corporate profits. Also adding to the tensions was U.S. President DonaldTrump's threat of "severe punishment" if it was found journalistJamal Khashoggi, who disappeared on Oct. 2, was killed in theSaudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia has vowed to retaliateto any move to punish the Kingdom. urn:newsml:reuters.com:*:nL2N1WT06Burn:newsml:reuters.com:*:nD5N1VR01Y "We've entered a volatile and erratic phase in the market,primarily driven by accelerating rate concerns," said AndreBakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC inBernardsville, New Jersey. "And the Saudi situation adds to this volatility." The clearest picture yet of the impact of the U.S.-Chinatrade war will be the third-quarter earnings season, especiallythe company forecasts. Profits at S&P companies are expected tohave risen 21.5 percent, according to I/B/E/S data fromRefinitiv, less than the growth in the past two quarters.

 By Manas Mishra Oct 15 (Reuters) - Up to 10,000 Americans due to have hip or knee replacements will be able to funnel basic health data directly from their Apple Watches to their surgeons under a new app being tested by orthopedics company Zimmer Biomet. Four hospitals and more than a dozen other medical facilities in states including Massachusetts, California, Colorado and Michigan will receive stats including heart rate, steps taken and standing hours from patients waiting for or recovering from hip and knee replacement surgery. More than a million knee and hip replacements occur every year in the United States, making them two of the most common surgeries Americans undergo. "When you look at what patients have to do when they undergo hip and knee replacement, in some cases they have very low support or guidance before and after surgery, which creates a lot of unnecessary fear and anxiety," Zimmer Biomet executive Dan Williamson said. "We believe this is going to create a new ecosystem in orthopedics that ultimately drive less anxiety in patients, and more visibility from the surgeon." The app could also help doctors monitor the health of their patients who prefer to stay at home after surgery rather than opt for nursing facilities and other care centers. Apple has been working on new health initiatives for its users, announcing the Apple Watch Series 4 last month, which can detect heart problems, positioning the new watch as a more comprehensive health device.  
 
 By Medha Singh Oct 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open on Monday, mirroring global stocks, as growing tensions between Western powers and Saudi Arabia added to worries over rising borrowing costs and the impact of tariffs as the earnings season kicks into gear. Shares of Bank of America  reversed losses to trade 0.21 percent higher premarket after the second-largest U.S. lender's profit rose more than expected, boosted by lower costs, and as lending growth helped offset lower bond trading revenue.  Investors suspect the latest developments could undermine the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and has the potential to eventually destabilize the oil-rich kingdom. "The indices are poised to open the new trading week in the red as tensions between the Saudis and the U.S. mount, dampening the prospects of Friday's relief rally to extend," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. Last week ended on a positive note with the benchmark S&P 500  rebounding after six sessions of losses. But Wall Street still notched its biggest weekly fall since March. The clearest picture yet of the impact of the U.S.-China trade war will be the third-quarter earnings season, especially the company forecasts. Profits at S&P companies are expected to have risen 21.5 percent, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv, less than the growth in the past two quarters.

 Oct 14 (Reuters) - Apple Inc  has acquired music analytics start-up Asaii, Axios reported on Sunday, citing sources, in a bid to strengthen content recommendations to its music users. Apple's deal to buy Asaii was worth less than $100 million, Axios, citing a source. Asaii can help Apple compete with Spotify Technology SA's  efforts to work directly with smaller artists, like a music label, the report added. Apple and Asaii were not immediately available for comment outside regular business hours. 
 
Wall St Week Ahead-New communication sector's shine could soon wear off
 By April Joyner NEW YORK, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The mash-up of old and new media may not be a winning combination for the new S&P communication services sector index  as its highest fliers face regulatory threats and challenges to user growth. The reconstituted sector, which debuted at the end of September, includes telecom, internet, media and entertainment companies such as AT&T Inc, Walt Disney Co  and Twitter Inc. Facebook and Alphabet moved to communication services from the technology sector. Netflix was previously in the consumer discretionary sector. The other FAANG stocks, Amazon.com Inc  and Apple Inc, remain in the consumer discretionary and technology sectors, respectively. The addition of several FAANG stocks, among the fastest-rising shares on the S&P 500, has brought more attention to the once-sleepy sector, formerly known as telecom. Indeed, so far communication services has closely tracked the technology sector. Both have slid significantly during sell-offs in October, including a 5.3-percent drop for the S&P 500 over Wednesday and Thursday. The two indexes recovered somewhat in trading on Friday. The communication sector was last down 5.3 percent month-to-date, ahead of tech's 6.0 percent slide. On one hand, the communication sector's old-media names have cushioned it somewhat in comparison to tech's steeper plunge, but those less growth-oriented companies also limit the sector's upside potential. Also, several of the sector's growth companies - Facebook, Alphabet and Twitter - face regulatory risks that tech companies do not. Recent disclosures of privacy breaches have increased concern among some investors that the U.S. government could soon target internet companies with new regulations. "The regulatory pendulum tends to swing from 'not enough' to 'too much,' and it will take time to balance," said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis. "In the meantime, we have to think about overregulation." As a result, market strategists have been less than enthused. On Monday, Wells Fargo Investment Institute gave the sector an "unfavorable" rating. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and RBC Capital Markets rate the sector "underweight." On Monday, Google announced that private data from 500,000 users of its Google+ social network, whose consumer version is being shut down, may have been exposed to external developers. On Sept. 28, Facebook said that hackers had stolen digital login codes allowing them to take over user accounts. Some 29 million accounts were affected, the company said in a update on Friday. Executives from Facebook and Twitter had testified before Congress in September on their companies' data security practices. Another communications high-flier, Netflix, faces a separate challenge. Netflix's shares dropped 5.2 percent on July 17 after the company's rate of international subscriber growth in the second quarter underwhelmed investors. Another disappointing number for international growth could alarm investors, said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta. "That would be a concern because Netflix is so dependent on the international side in terms of its growth," Morgan said. "The domestic side has become pretty mature." Netflix is scheduled to report its third-quarter results on Tuesday. Given the risks to the communication sector's internet stocks, the sector is less attractive than technology or consumer discretionary for investors seeking growth, said Wren. At the same time, the sector's relatively high price-to-earnings ratio and low yield make it unsuitable for value-oriented investors. Also, two communication stocks, Netflix and Alphabet, are among the most trade-sensitive within the 100 largest U.S. stocks by market cap, according to an Oct. 4 note from Morgan Stanley. Both have been more reactive to Chinese market assets relative to other large-cap stocks since March, when U.S. President Donald Trump first announced tariffs on Chinese goods, said Brian Hayes, quantitative analyst at Morgan Stanley, in an email to Reuters. To be sure, the FAANG stocks remain among the most popular buys on Wall Street. The NYSE FANG+TM index, which holds those stocks along with several other growth stocks, including Twitter, is up 15.1 percent year to date, well above the S&P 500's 3.6-percent advance. But with that popularity also comes outsized potential for downside in the sector they dominate. "The level of valuation tends to be quite high," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. "That's the primary issue here and the primary risk." 
 
4 Complaints Apple Users Already Have About the New iPhones
  Apple's    (NASDAQ: AAPL)  latest iPhone models cost $1,000 or more,   but users already have a list of complaints about them.The iPhone XS and larger iPhone XS Max became available for   pre-order on Sept. 14 and shipped out on Sept. 21. So far, some   users have been vocal about some fairly big bugs, including   charging and connectivity issues. Apple also has a   cheaper $749 iPhone XR    , but it won't come out until the end of October.  Considering the 5.8-inch XS starts at $999 and the   6.5-inch XS Max starts at $1,099, users have a right to expect   Apple to quickly fix these early bugs on its new lineup of   smartphones. Let's hope the latest iOS 12 update will provide a   better experience.  Apple's new iPhone XS has had mixed reviews from its early     adopters. Image source: Apple.A number of people complained in Apple's support communities   about charging issues with their iPhone XS or iPhone XS Max.   According to the posts, some customers were having trouble   charging their new smartphones with a lightning cable. Some users   said that although their phones wouldn't charge in sleep mode,   they would start charging once they were "woken up." But nobody   wants to have to keep their phone on the whole time they're   charging their device. And furthermore, other users said their   phone wouldn't charge at all, awake or asleep.  The second complaint against the new iPhones is their weak   reception. Users claim that their old iPhones had better   reception in certain places than their new iPhone, which is   obviously frustrating when you've forked out around $1,000 for   the latest model. However, this problem wasn't universal across   all the new iPhones, and Apple has reached out to certain   affected users to work through the issue. This complaint might not be as serious as the first two   complaints, but it's lit up the Apple forums nonetheless. Some   owners of the new iPhones have been complaining that the camera   on the new models over-smooths peoples' skin. But this effect   isn't Apple's way of giving people an automatic Photoshop job.   Instead, Apple has been working on noise reduction on the   pictures its camera takes to help it work better in low light   conditions. While this update is a good thing, it also creates a   softer look that makes skin look slightly airbrushed. Besides LTE reception problems, new iPhone users have also   been complaining about slower Wi-Fi speeds compared to their old   iPhones. This turned out to be an issue with the iPhone XS   devices automatically joining Wi-Fi networks in 2.4GHz, even if   both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands were available. On Oct. 9, Apple released an update to iOS 12 that it claims   will fix some of the main complaints such as the charging and   Wi-Fi connectivity issues. Here's a list of the iOS 12 bug   fixes: Apple users should be encouraged to see the company quickly   rolling out fixes for their complaints. They should also be   pleased that Apple actually reached out to its early adopters to   ask them about their negative experiences because it shows that   the company clearly cares about giving its users the best   experience possible.And Apple isn't alone in having issues with its new devices.   In fact, it's normal and almost expected for just-released   smartphones to have bugs that need to be addressed. And as long   as the iPhones don't start spontaneously catching on fire like   the infamous   Samsung    (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF)    Galaxy Note 7    , customers seem likely to be more than willing to forgive and   forget.  10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

 By Yawen Chen NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 14 (Reuters) - China central bank governor Yi Gang said on Sunday he still sees plenty of room for adjustment in interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), as downside risks from trade tensions with the United States remain significant. China faced "tremendous uncertainties" due to the impact of tariffs and trade frictions and was seeking a "constructive solution" to the current trade tensions, Yi said at a seminar on the sidelines of the annual International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings on the Indonesian island of Bali. Beijing and Washington have slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on each other and plans for bilateral trade talks to resolve the dispute have stalled, triggering a market rout and putting pressure on China's already softening economy and weakening currency. Yi said China's economic growth would still comfortably reach its full-year target of around 6.5 percent in 2018 with the possibility of overshooting, adding that he was comfortable with current inflation levels. China has implemented four RRR cuts this year, releasing billions in new liquidity to the market, and used other tools to push down corporate lending rates, but Yi said trade tensions with the United States could hit the economy further. "I think the downside risks from trade tensions are significant," the central bank chief said. "Tremendous uncertainties (are) ahead of us." Yi said China's monetary stance was still basically neutral, without an easing or tightening bias, adding that he believed the amount of liquidity pumped into the market was appropriate to stabilize leverage. In an interview with Bloomberg, Yi said that the central bank was preparing for a range of risks in its currency policy, including a worst-case scenario. But he told Bloomberg that the currency was at a "reasonable and equilibrium level." China has sought to reduce its massive debt pile, with a state-led crackdown on shadow banking and excessive lending to unproductive sectors such as real estate. "Our overall leverage has been stabilized, so that is an achievement. The recent decrease of RRR or other monetary instruments is basically to supply adequate liquidity," he said. Yi expected China's consumer price inflation to come in at around 2 percent for the year, with producer price inflation falling to a range of 3 percent to 4 percent. Cross-border capital flows had been normal, he added, while China's economy has shifted away from exports to become more domestically driven. China's current account could turn positive this year with "a bit" of a surplus, even though it would still account for less than 1 percent of gross domestic product, Yi said. Meanwhile, China was seeking a constructive solution to the trade row, while speeding up reforms to strengthen intellectual property right protection and "significantly" opening up financial services. "We are sincere to show that we are willing to have a constructive solution. And a constructive solution is better than a trade war, which is lose-lose," he said. 
 
2 Reasons Apple's In-House Chip Efforts Are a Huge Asset
 Back in 2008,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) bought a small microprocessor designer called   P.A. Semi for $278 million    . Over the years, Apple has continued to build on its chip   efforts through both acquisitions and extensive organic expansion   efforts.Today, there should be no doubt that Apple's chip-development   organization is extremely capable. It develops the applications   processors that enable many of the capabilities of   multibillion-dollar product lines such as the iPhone, iPad, and   Apple Watch.  Image source: Apple.The company's chip efforts have also expanded beyond   applications processor design -- which, in itself, requires   proficiency in a wide array of areas -- to include things like   wireless chips, as well as (more recently)   power-management chips    .Here, I'll go over some of the reasons why Apple's in-house   chip-development efforts are an important strategic asset for the   company.One reason why Apple develops its own chips is so that it can   deliver differentiated performance and capabilities relative to   what it could source from a merchant chip supplier. That   differentiation was in full view with the company's latest   A12 Bionic chip    , which powers the newest iPhones. AnandTech's    Andrei Frumusanu recently did a lot of in-depth testing of the   A12 Bionic, and the results look quite impressive. Apple's A12   Bionic chips "have better energy efficiency than all recent   Android [systems-on-a-chip] while having a nearly 2x performance   advantage," according to Frumusanu."I wouldn't be surprised that if we were to normalise for   energy used, Apple would have a 3x performance lead," he   added.As if that weren't impressive enough, Frumusanu said that   "we're now talking about very small margins until Apple's mobile   SoCs outperform the fastest desktop CPUs in terms of   [single-threaded] performance."Apple's chip efforts aren't limited to building excellent   CPUs, either. Apple said that its last-generation A11 Bionic chip   incorporated the company's first in-house graphics processing   unit (GPU). The A12 Bionic appears to have a new iteration of   that in-house design. Once again, Frumusanu had some very kind   words to say about this aspect of the chip. He wrote that "the   iPhone XS and XS Max, thanks to the new A12 SoC, showcase   industry leading performance and efficiency, and currently are   the best mobile platforms for gaming, period."That's high praise and seemingly a clear validation of Apple's   strategy of building its own iPhone applications processors.Apple often introduces new product categories, and those   products tend to require sophisticated chip technology. In 2015,   Apple launched the Apple Watch, which incorporated an   Apple-designed applications processor known as the S1. Apple has   rapidly iterated on the Apple Watch category, and with each new   product introduction, it has made significant strides in the   capabilities of the chip inside.You also might recall that in late 2016, Apple introduced   wireless earbuds called AirPods. Those earbuds -- which Apple CFO   Luca Maestri referred to as a "runaway success" on the company's   most recent earnings call -- incorporate a custom-designed chip   called the W1 chip that enables a lot of compelling   functionality, which you can read more about   here    . Apple incorporated a newer W2 chip in its Apple Watch Series 3,   and it seems reasonable to expect that updated AirPods would   incorporate it, too.Having the ability to build its own chips for whatever   products it wants to bring to market -- whether they be   iterations on existing product lines with cool new features or   entirely new product categories for the company -- is a big deal   for Apple. It means that Apple's product groups can, in effect,   let the internal chip teams know what chips they need and have   chips tailored to the exact needs of those product lines. Not   only can this speed up Apple's ability to bring new products to   market, but it can allow the company to deliver better user   experiences, too.  10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

  Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) is a wildly successful company that has delivered   tremendous gains for investors over the long term. Over the last   10 years, Apple shares are up more than 1450%, meaning that every   $1,000 invested has grown to more than $15,000 as of this writing   -- and that's not including   dividend payments    .Nevertheless, while Apple is a great company that has proven   to be an excellent investment, no company's shares are without   risk. Here, I'd like to go over two key risks that current and   potential Apple investors should be aware of.  Image source: Apple.Apple's business is critically dependent on sales of its   iPhone product line. During its fiscal year 2017, revenue from   iPhone sales made up 61.6% of the company's net revenue. During   the first three quarters of fiscal year 2018, the iPhone was   responsible for 63.8% of Apple's sales.With that in mind, the first risk that investors need to be   aware of is that the overall smartphone market is slowing.   According to a report published in May by IDC, industrywide   smartphone volumes are set to decline by 0.2% in 2018. The   researchers also project that smartphone shipments will grow at   just a 2.5% compound annual rate between 2017 and 2022.IDC's figures merely represent forecasts -- they might turn   out to be too low, too high, or about right -- but the point is   that the smartphone market just isn't growing like it used   to.During the first three quarters of Apple's fiscal year 2018,   iPhone shipments were approximately flat year over year. (If you   want to nitpick, shipments were actually up 0.44% during that   time.) However, the company has driven substantial growth in   iPhone average selling prices, fueling revenue growth for Apple   in this business over the past year. How long it can continue to   successfully grow iPhone average selling prices remains to be   seen.Although Apple is, of course, subject to the trends of the   markets that it participates in, the company's performance --   and, in particular, its iPhone business -- is also dependent on   Apple-specific execution.The iPhones introduced in the fall are the company's flagship   products for roughly an entire year. This means that they need to   remain attractive to consumers as the competitive landscape   becomes tougher over the course of an iPhone's time as the   flagship offering. (Android smartphone vendors tend to launch new   flagships in the months following an iPhone launch.)It's hard to overstate just how much Apple has riding on each   new iPhone introduction. Moreover, year in and year out, the   company has to not only develop compelling products (a tough feat   in itself that requires Apple to spend billions of dollars per   year on research and development), but it also needs to make sure   that they can be manufactured in extremely high volumes at   acceptable cost structures. This means that Apple has to work   closely with its vast network of supply chain partners to ensure   that the production ramps of new products go as smoothly as   possible.Naturally, Apple has done a good job with that -- it wouldn't   bring in the kinds of   profits    and be   as valuable as it is    if its execution weren't consistently solid -- but investors   shouldn't assume that the risk of something going wrong is   nonexistent.  10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

The Spektral buyout along with other acquisitions made by Apple   in the AR space is expected to contribute to revenues, thereby   eliminating excessive dependence on iPhone.     Competition Rife in the AR Space      At its last WWDC, the iPhone maker unveiled ARKit 2, with   enhanced features like multiplayer for AR. The feature will allow   two or more people to log in an app and see the same AR objects   in the same shared space. Notably, the company is looking to   unveil its AR headset or device by 2020.        However, we believe Apple may be too late to enter the space,   which is currently dominated by the likes of Alphabet   GOOGL    , Microsoft   MSFT    and Snap   SNAP    .        Similar to ARKit, Google's ARCore uses motion tracking,   environmental understanding and light estimation to integrate   virtual content with the real world.        Additionally, Microsoft's HoloLens offers Mixed Reality (MR)   technology and has gained significant adoption among developers.   Also, Snap's features like Show Portals, lenses and filters,   which offer unique user experience, is a concern for Apple.        However, Apple's aggressive push in the AR market, especially in   wearables, is expected to help the company boost its revenues.   Notably, the company's financials already crossed the $10 billion   mark in revenues from wearables over the trailing four quarters.        Moreover, with global spending on AR and virtual reality (VR)   market projected at a CAGR of 71.6% between 2017 and 2022, per   market research firm   IDC    , Apple's efforts to increase its AR capabilities is a positive.

  Netflix NFLX  has snapped up a number of Hollywood 'A' listers to boost its content portfolio.

Price and Consensus      Netflix, Inc. Price and Consensus    |      Netflix, Inc. Quote  Although management cited over-optimistic guidance, we believe subscriber addition pace has hit a rough patch due to increasing competition from Alphabet's GOOGL  YouTube and HBO.    Post Time Warner's acquisition, AT&T T  has shown interest in increasing spending on HBO for content acquisition. Moreover, aggressive investment toward developing original content by the likes of Apple AAPL  and Amazon Prime is intensifying competition in the streaming market.    Further, Disney is also gearing up to enter the streaming market and the pending acquisition of 21st Century Fox's assets will expand its content portfolio significantly.    Nevertheless, Netflix's Hollywood partnerships and high production values have helped its shows win accolades and awards.

Some Great News for This Apple Supplier
  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company    (NYSE: TSM) , or TSMC for short, is one of   Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL) most important suppliers. The company has   manufactured Apple's A-series chips starting with the A8 and   continuing through to today's A12 Bionic chip and has been the   exclusive manufacturer of all but one of those chips --   the A9    .According to an Oct. 12 report from DigiTimes, TSMC has not   only won the business to manufacture the applications processor   that'll power next year's iPhones, but it's going to be the sole   manufacturer of those chips.  Image source: Apple.Let's take a look at why you should care.During Apple's last iPhone product cycle, the company offered   the iPhone 8-series and iPhone X devices as its flagships, iPhone   7-series devices as its mid-range offerings, and iPhone 6s-series   and iPhone SE smartphones as its lowest-end products. The iPhone   6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and   iPhone SE    were powered by Apple's A9 applications processor, which was   dual-sourced from both TSMC as well as rival   Samsung    (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) .This meant that while TSMC enjoyed the lion's share of Apple's   A-series orders during the last product cycle, it didn't quite   have 100% share. That changed this year with Apple's new product   launches, as the company discontinued the iPhone 6s-series and   iPhone SE devices.If DigiTimes' report is accurate, then TSMC is set to maintain   its 100% share of Apple's A-series applications processor orders   during the next iPhone product cycle.On TSMC's July 19 earnings call, CFO Lora Ho said that sales   of 7nm wafers would make up 10% of the company's total wafer   revenue in the third quarter of the year, with that figure   growing to "more than 20%" in the fourth quarter of the year.   That growth is undoubtedly significantly driven by the fact that   Apple's latest trio of iPhones are all powered by the   7nm A12 Bionic chip    .Assuming that the upcoming A13 chip will also be manufactured   using TSMC's 7nm technology (if TSMC is building it, then the use   of 7nm technology is a sure bet), then the roll-out of the new   iPhones next year should lead to an increase in TSMC's 7nm   revenue as a percentage of its overall sales.Indeed, today, Apple's lowest-end iPhone 7-series devices use   A10 Fusion    chips manufactured using TSMC's 16nm technology, the mid-range   iPhone 8-series smartphones use A11 Bionic chips built using   TSMC's 10nm technology, and the highest-end iPhone XR, iPhone XS,   and iPhone XS Max have 7nm silicon.By the time the next iPhone cycle comes around, the iPhone 8   and iPhone 8 Plus could be bumped down to become Apple's   entry-level offerings, the iPhone XR could be positioned as the   iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are today, and at the high end, it   seems reasonable to expect successors to today's iPhone XR,   iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max. In that case, only Apple's   lowest-end offerings in the next iPhone product cycle would use   application processors built using anything but TSMC's 7nm   technology.According to EETimes Asia, TSMC will start so-called "risk   production" of chips built using its upcoming 5nm technology in   April of 2019. This technology,   EETimes Asia    reports, citing comments from TSMC, will "deliver 14.7% to 17.7%   speed gains and 1.8 to 1.86 [times] area shrinks based on tests   with Arm A72 cores."If Apple continues to stick with TSMC -- something I'd be   willing to bet on -- I think it's safe to assume that Apple will   use the latter's 5nm technology to manufacture the A14 chips   that'll power the 2020 iPhone lineup.  10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor     Manufacturing       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

After Hours Most Active for Oct 12, 2018 :  QQQ, S, AAPL, ZNGA, KR, SIRI, GE, T, SYMC, MSFT, F, BABA
The NASDAQ 100 After Hours Indicator  is up 2.71 to 7,159.92. The total After hours volume is currently 48,258,295 shares traded.      The following are the  most active stocks for the after hours session  : 
 Technology stocks were hit hard on Oct 10, logging their worst day in more than seven years, as part of the broad-based selloffs. The sector was one of the most hurt because it was hot and soaring this year and investors' favorite destination. So, amid global market bloodbath, sectors that are guilty of overvaluation concerns were mainly clobbered.The S&P 500 Information Technology Index shed 4.85%  on Oct 10, marking the biggest decline since Aug 18, per CNBC. All 65 members of the index were in the red on that day. Shares of Apple AAPL  , Microsoft MSFT  , Amazon AMZN  , Facebook FB  and Twitter TWTR  were down 4.6%, 5.4%, 6.2% 4.1% and 8.5%, respectively, on Oct 10. Advanced Micro Devices Inc.  AMD  , which has skyrocketed about 150% in 2018, slid 8.2% on Oct 10, and lost the most on the index. Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLK )  retreated about 6.1% in the last two days (read: 5 Tech ETFs That Tumbled Most on Broad Market Rout  ).Going forward, these big names are likely to drop as and when global market selloff crops up as this high-flying space will correct itself. The negative sentiment is likely to continue at least in the near term if the Fed remains super-hawkish on upbeat economic data.Price-to-earnings ratio is at 32.31  x in the third quarter of 2018 for Technology Sector, trailing only Healthcare. Among technology, communications equipment (P/E of 114.79x), computer networks (363.71x) and computer processing, cloud services (P/E of 95.75x) and software programming (59.35x) boast loft valuations.Given this, investors can easily tap any bearish trend by considering a near-term short on the technology sector. Fortunately, with the advent of ETFs, this is quite easy as there are a few options to accomplish this task. Below we highlight them and some of the key differences between each. ProShares UltraShort Technology ( REW ) This fund seeks two times (2x) inverse exposure to the Dow Jones U.S. Technology Index, charging 95 bps in fees. REW has returned about 11.4% over the last two days (as of Oct 11, 2018). MicroSectors FANG+ -3X Inverse Leveraged ETN ( FNGD ) The note is linked to the performance of the NYSE FANG+ Index. The underlying index includes 10 highly liquid stocks that represent a segment of the technology and consumer discretionary sectors consisting of highly traded growth stocks of technology and tech-enabled companies. The fund charges 95 bps in fees. The fund gained about 18.6% in the last two days (read: Explore FANG+ With These New ETFs  ). Direxion Daily Technology Bear 3x Shares ( TECS ) Investors with a more bearish view and a higher risk appetite may find TECS interesting as the product provides three times (3x) inverse exposure to the daily performance of the Technology Select Sector Index. The fund gained 18.7% in the same time frame. ProShares UltraShort Semiconductors ETF ( SSG ) This fund targets the semiconductor corner of the broader technology sector as it provides two times inverse exposure to the daily performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Semiconductors Index. Expense ratio comes in at 0.95%. The fund added 10.9% in the same time frame. Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3x Shares ( SOXS ) This ETF offers three times inverse exposure to the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index, charging investors 95 bps in annual fees. The fund surged 16.8% in the same time frame. Want key ETF info delivered straight to your   inbox?

Apple Will Give Away Its $1 Billion of Original Content
  Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been developing its own original content since   the beginning of   last year    . It has some 24 original series in the works and two films,   according to reports. That could be the start of a branded   subscription video on demand, or SVOD, service.But Apple might not be planning to sell subscriptions for its   own SVOD service. It might not even run advertisements alongside   its original content, despite the growing popularity of   ad-supported video on demand. Instead, it could simply give   access to its originals to anyone with an iPhone or iPad,   according to a report from   CNBC    .  Image source: Apple.Apple isn't just giving Apple fans two dozen original shows   and a couple of films out of the kindness of its heart. While   Apple appreciates all the people using the 1.3 billion active   Apple devices around the world, it appreciates their potential to   buy new services even more.Services is an increasingly important part of Apple's   business, accounting for 18% of revenue in the company's most   recent fiscal third quarter. And considering the higher-margin   profile of most of its services businesses, it accounts for a   larger share of profits.CNBC's report suggests Apple could use its originals to boost   its services segment by introducing its users to other streaming   services like Hulu, HBO Now, Showtime, and lesser-known premium   services like Boomerang or Shudder.Apple will use the originals to attract its users to the TV   app on iOS, and from there suggest other streaming video apps to   download. In that sense, Apple wants to be more like   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN)    Prime Video Channels    instead of Amazon Prime Instant Video.Amazon has had a lot of success with Channels, driving over 1   million subscribers to each of HBO, Showtime, and Starz. It's   signed on more and more partners over the past couple of years as   well, and it's become one of the largest sources for SVOD   subscriptions in the world. One estimate even says Prime Video   Channels accounts for 55% of all direct-to-consumer video   subscriptions.It's easy to see why Apple would want in on that action.   Driving tens of millions of monthly subscriptions would be a very   high-margin revenue source. If the cost of entry is just $1   billion of PG-rated content, Apple will gladly pony up that cash   for a crack at the massive and growing market. And like Amazon,   it has a built-in customer base in the form of iOS users. Only   the iOS user base may be around 10 times the size of Amazon's   Prime members.Apple's TV app currently asks customers to download each   individual SVOD service app on their phone and sign up for a   subscription with each provider. But Apple could remove a lot of   friction from the process by allowing customers to subscribe   directly from the TV app, no additional apps necessary.   Bloomberg    reported Apple was working on such a mechanism earlier this   year.Some SVOD services would likely welcome any opportunity to   increase their subscriber numbers. But larger services would   likely hesitate to hand over control of their brand and customer   experience to Apple. Apple has already seen significant pushback   from   Netflix    with regard to both its   TV app    and its   revenue share    of subscriptions.So, Apple needs to make the TV app so popular that SVOD   services are compelled to partner with it in order to maximize   their revenue. That won't be easy, but the idea of keeping a   walled garden of content in the TV app is smart. It's worked for   Amazon to attract millions of customers to other SVOD services,   and it could work for Apple, too. If not, the $1 billion will   sting a bit, but rest assured Apple won't have much trouble   making that back.  10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Wall St Week Ahead-New communication sector's shine could soon wear off
 By April Joyner NEW YORK, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The mash-up of old and new media may not be a winning combination for the new S&P communication services sector index  as its highest fliers face regulatory threats and challenges to user growth. The reconstituted sector, which debuted at the end of September, includes telecom, internet, media and entertainment companies such as AT&T Inc, Walt Disney Co  and Twitter Inc. Facebook and Alphabet moved to communication services from the technology sector. Netflix was previously in the consumer discretionary sector. The other FAANG stocks, Amazon.com Inc  and Apple Inc, remain in the consumer discretionary and technology sectors, respectively. The addition of several FAANG stocks, among the fastest-rising shares on the S&P 500, has brought more attention to the once-sleepy sector, formerly known as telecom. Indeed, so far communication services has closely tracked the technology sector. Both have slid significantly during sell-offs in October, including a 5.3-percent drop for the S&P 500 over Wednesday and Thursday. The two indexes recovered somewhat in trading on Friday. The communication sector was last down 5.3 percent month-to-date, ahead of tech's 6.0 percent slide. On one hand, the communication sector's old-media names have cushioned it somewhat in comparison to tech's steeper plunge, but those less growth-oriented companies also limit the sector's upside potential. Also, several of the sector's growth companies - Facebook, Alphabet and Twitter - face regulatory risks that tech companies do not. Recent disclosures of privacy breaches have increased concern among some investors that the U.S. government could soon target internet companies with new regulations. "The regulatory pendulum tends to swing from 'not enough' to 'too much,' and it will take time to balance," said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis. "In the meantime, we have to think about overregulation." As a result, market strategists have been less than enthused. On Monday, Wells Fargo Investment Institute gave the sector an "unfavorable" rating. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and RBC Capital Markets rate the sector "underweight." On Monday, Google announced that private data from 500,000 users of its Google+ social network, whose consumer version is being shut down, may have been exposed to external developers. On Sept. 28, Facebook said that hackers had stolen digital login codes allowing them to take over user accounts. Some 29 million accounts were affected, the company said in a update on Friday. Executives from Facebook and Twitter had testified before Congress in September on their companies' data security practices. Another communications high-flier, Netflix, faces a separate challenge. Netflix's shares dropped 5.2 percent on July 17 after the company's rate of international subscriber growth in the second quarter underwhelmed investors. Another disappointing number for international growth could alarm investors, said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta. "That would be a concern because Netflix is so dependent on the international side in terms of its growth," Morgan said. "The domestic side has become pretty mature." Netflix is scheduled to report its third-quarter results on Tuesday. Given the risks to the communication sector's internet stocks, the sector is less attractive than technology or consumer discretionary for investors seeking growth, said Wren. At the same time, the sector's relatively high price-to-earnings ratio and low yield make it unsuitable for value-oriented investors. Also, two communication stocks, Netflix and Alphabet, are among the most trade-sensitive within the 100 largest U.S. stocks by market cap, according to an Oct. 4 note from Morgan Stanley. Both have been more reactive to Chinese market assets relative to other large-cap stocks since March, when U.S. President Donald Trump first announced tariffs on Chinese goods, said Brian Hayes, quantitative analyst at Morgan Stanley, in an email to Reuters. To be sure, the FAANG stocks remain among the most popular buys on Wall Street. The NYSE FANG+TM index, which holds those stocks along with several other growth stocks, including Twitter, is up 15.1 percent year to date, well above the S&P 500's 3.6-percent advance. But with that popularity also comes outsized potential for downside in the sector they dominate. "The level of valuation tends to be quite high," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. "That's the primary issue here and the primary risk."

 By Sinéad Carew NEW YORK, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index snapped a six-day losing streak on Friday as technology stocks recovered after a week of losses, with investors looking for bargains ahead of the third quarter earnings reporting season.  Even the hard-hit S&P500 energy and financial sectors managed to close the session with slight gains after a late afternoon rally. "People are starting to buy in, thinking the higher flying growth stocks were oversold. They wanted to get in before next week when earnings start coming," said Janna Sampson, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. But until the U.S. and China reach a trade deal, the rebound in the stockmarket could be vulnerable as investors are anxious about the impact of tariffs on corporate profits. "If earnings come out good I think this rally is sustainable if we don't get negative trade news. Trade news is the wild card. That's the big if," said Sampson. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 287.16 points, or 1.15 percent, to 25,339.99, the S&P 500  gained 38.76 points, or 1.42 percent, to 2,767.13 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 167.83 points, or 2.29 percent, to 7,496.89. The technology sector's biggest boosts were Apple, and Microsoft  which rose more than 3.0 percent. Visa  and Mastercard  both climbed almost 5.0 percent, boosted by strong credit card sales included in bank earnings reports, according to Oakbook's Sampson.  The S&P500's financial sector ended the day up 0.1 percent and the S&P 500 banks subsector  closed down 0.4 percent, well above its session low. The biggest drag on the subsector was JPMorgan Chase & Co, which closed down 1.0 percent despite reporting a quarterly profit that beat expectations.  PNC Financial  led the percentage losers among bank stocks, with a 5.6 percent drop after the regional bank reported disappointing quarterly loan growth and said it expected only a small improvement in lending this quarter.  The three gainers among banks included Citigroup, which rose 2.0 percent, and Wells Fargo, which eked out a 1.3 percent gain after upbeat results.  Netflix  and Amazon, some of the names that took a big hits in the week's selloff, rose 5.7 percent and  and 4.0 percent respectively. The bank results launch a quarterly reporting season that will give the clearest picture yet of the impact on profits from President Donald Trump's trade war with China. Earnings at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 21.5 percent in the third quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv, a slowdown from the previous two quarters. Energy stocks  ended the day up 0.3 percent as oil prices steadied to settle up slightly after a volatile session dropped on a weakening oil demand outlook.  The consumer discretionary  and communication services  sectors, both rose more than 2.0 percent.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.38-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.51-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 index posted no new 52-week highs and 52 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 10 new highs and 234 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.91 billion shares, well above the 7.78 billion average for the last 20 trading days but below the soaring volume of Thursday's and Wednesday's sessions.

    On today's episode of the Zacks Friday Finish Line, Associate Stock Strategist Ryan McQueeney and Editor Maddy Johnson recap a volatile week in global markets. The hosts chat about the stock selloff, inflation concerns, global economic growth, and bond yields. Later, they discuss the slow-bleeding fall of Sears.Make sure to subscribe and leave the show a rating on Apple Podcasts  !U.S. stocks are rebounding Friday after a brutal two-day stretch of selling that saw major indexes suffer their worst losses in months. Momentum stocks like Square SQ  were brutalized, while market leaders such as Apple AAPL  , Amazon AMZN  , and Microsoft MSFT  also saw significant volatility.The selloff was inspired by a number of concerns, including worries that the American economy is overheating while growth in key global markets is slowing down.One topic of discussion this week was the bond market. Bond prices have been falling, sending bond yields to multi-year highs. Bond prices are typically correlated with stock prices, but this effect normally takes time to manifest as it relates to the cost of borrowing and its effect on company earnings.This week, we saw what can happen when yields rise suddenly, as many investors simply were not interested in buying higher-risk equities.Interestingly, inflation was a major topic of concern as well, even though the latest Consumer Price Index came in cooler than expected. September's CPI increased 0.1 percent, down from a rise of 0.2% in August. CPI growth on a year-over-year basis was 2.3%, also slower than the 2.7% advance seen in August.But that read was not enough to calm Wall Street, which also had plenty of troubling headlines from foreign markets to digest. Notably, China's stock market was hammered again as the country's central bank moved to stimulate its economy once again. There was also political and economic uncertainty developing in Brazil and Italy.This was all underscored after the International Monetary Fund lowered its worldwide economic growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019. The fund later elaborated that it is concerned rising trade and political tensions could put a dent in synchronous global recovery.Make sure to check out this week's episode for the key facts and Maddy's and Ryan's perspectives on all of these stories.Also this week, the Finish Line team discusses the impending bankruptcy of Sears SHLD  . The ever-struggling retailer has a huge debt bill due on Monday, and with suppliers already reporting that it has missed payments, the end finally looks near for Eddie Lampert's company.Maddy and Ryan spend some time discussing the legacy of Sears and Lampert.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe financial technology, or fintech, sector offers enormous growth potential for investors. Just look at  Square (NYSE: SQ ) stock, which is up over 100% this year. But fintech does not just affect scrappy startups. Traditional, large financial institutions and their stocks, such as  Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) and BAC stock, can also be positively influenced by fintech.Granted, BAC stock hasn't done much this year. Consider that Bank of America stock has only risen about 3% in 2018, while it offers a dividend yield of only 2%.But the bank has been investing aggressively in technology, and its advancements in tech could boost BAC stock. For example, BAC recently upgraded its mobile apps, resulting in seamless integration among its banking platform, Merrill Lynch, Merrill Edge and US Trust. In other words, users don't have to re-enter their passwords when they move among different apps owned by Bank of America.But the upgrade produced other interesting features, such as:Now such things may not seem groundbreaking. But then again, these efforts - which probably did take quite a bit of work - show that Bank of America is paying attention to customers' needs and trying to create the best experiences possible. That is the kind of approach usually taken by tech companies like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), rather than by a large bank.Bank of America is also being forward-looking. According to its own research, about three-quarters of millennials believe that all financial decisions will be made with the help of technology in their lifetimes. Actually, that seems like more of an understatement!Another part of the bank's tech strategy - which should be encouraging for owners of BAC stock - is its focus on partnerships. Partnering with other companies enables BAC to leverage additional resources and increase its speed-to-market.An example of the fruits of BAC's partnerships is the Zelle app, which is operated by a consortium of banks. The app enables person-to-person transactions, similar to those carried out via  PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ).BAC has aggressively promoted Zelle, and the app has become quite popular. In 2018, more than $25 billion in transactions have been processed through the app.BAC is the second-largest bank in the U.S.  Of course, large organizations usually have a tough time innovating because many executives typically have to weigh in on their major decisions. Additionally, because of large organizations' size, it is difficult for them to revamp their existing systems.But Bank of America, whose mobile apps have close to 26 million users, has shown that it can overcome these challenges.True, it will take time for these initiatives to move the needle. But for investors who are considering buying a bank stock, BAC stock does look attractive because of its efforts to implement new technologies.And besides, Bank of America stock is very cheap right now, as the forward price-earnings multiple of BAC stock is only about ten.  In other words, as the bank's investments in tech help enable its growth to accelerate, BAC stock should rise  above its current levels.Tom Taulli is the author of  High-Profit IPO Strategies ,  All About Commodities  and  All About Short Selling . Follow him on Twitter at  @ttaulli . As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post Bank of America Stock Likely to Be Boosted by Fintech appeared first on InvestorPlace .
 By Sinéad Carew NEW YORK, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Wall Street indexes rose on Friday after a week of blistering losses as investors returned to technology and other growth sectors, but gains were hampered by ongoing worries about U.S.-China trade tensions and rising interest rates. Energy and financial stocks continued to fall and bank stocks kicked off the third-quarter financial reporting season with a whimper, while investors fled insurance stocks after Hurricane Michael slammed into Florida. "Generally what we were seeing is more momentum and technology names selling off. Now buyers are coming back to say some of these are babies that were thrown out with the bath water," said Laura Kane, head of Americas thematic investing at UBS Global Wealth Management. "Now we've had the pullback, valuations look attractive," said Kane, although without a U.S.-China trade deal, "some of the sources of volatility are not going to go quickly," she added. At 2:42 p.m. EST (1842 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 24.69 points, or 0.1 percent, to 25,077.52, the S&P 500  gained 9.33 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,737.7 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 79.33 points, or 1.08 percent, to 7,408.39. All three indexes were on track for their biggest weekly declines since late March. The S&P's financial sector was the biggest percentage loser on the day with a 0.9 percent drop, while the S&P 500 banks subsector  slid 1.6 percent. The biggest drag on the subsector was JPMorgan Chase & Co, which reversed early gains to trade down 2 percent despite its quarterly profit beating expectations.  PNC Financial  led the percentage losers among bank stocks, with a 6.5 percent drop after the regional bank reported disappointing quarterly loan growth and said it expected only a small improvement in lending this quarter.  The only gainers among banks were Citigroup, which rose 0.6 percent, and Wells Fargo, which eked out a 0.64 percent gain after upbeat results.  Netflix, Amazon  and Apple  - some of the names that took a hit from the selloff this week - rose between 2 percent and 4 percent. The S&P 500 technology index  rose 1.77 percent, providing the biggest boost to the S&P 500. "The past few days were a bit of a wake-up call, but it also created an opportunity for those who have been missing out to buy some of these high-growth technology names," said Jason Browne, chief investment strategist at FundX Investment Group in San Francisco. The bank results launch a quarterly reporting season that will give the clearest picture yet of the impact on profits from President Donald Trump's trade war with China. Earnings at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 21.5 percent in the third quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv, a slowdown from the previous two quarters. Energy stocks  fell 0.80 percent as oil prices dropped after the International Energy Agency (IEA) deemed supply as adequate and the outlook for demand weakening.  Among the major gainers were the consumer discretionary  and communication services  sectors, which rose more than 1 percent each. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.25-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.08-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 52 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 9 new highs and 220 new lows.

  Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) has long sourced power management IC, or PMIC,   products from a small company called   Dialog Semiconductor    (NASDAQOTH: DLGNF) . This business has been lucrative for Dialog,   which indicated in its most recent annual report that about 77%   of its sales in 2017 came from Apple.Unfortunately, the fact that Dialog relies so heavily on sales   to Apple created a significant customer concentration risk. That   risk factor seemed to play out when Dialog revealed that Apple   would be using a main PMIC from another supplier for one of the   three iPhones that launched earlier this year (a   teardown report    from TechInsights showed that   iPhone XS Max    has an Apple-designed main PMIC).  Image source: Apple.On Oct. 11, Dialog announced that it had signed a licensing   agreement with Apple related to PMIC technology. Let's take a   closer look at exactly what's going on, here.Dialog says it'll get $300 million "in cash for the license of   certain PMIC technologies and the transfer of certain PMIC assets   and employees, payable upon closing."The company revealed that "over 300 employees -- representing   16% of Dialog's global workforce" will move over to Apple. Apple   will also take over "certain Dialog facilities in Livorno,   Swindon, Nabern and Neuaubing."On top of that, Dialog added that Apple is going to prepay   $300 million "for products to be delivered over the next three   years."Dialog explains that while it expects to keep shipping main   PMIC chips to Apple for the designs that it's already in, it   stated that "[no] new revenue contribution [is] expected from   main PMICs for 2019 iPhone models and for 2020 iPad or Watch   models."In other words, Apple has designed Dialog out of the main PMIC   spots in its iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch products over the long   term. That's certainly going to lead to a reduction in Dialog's   revenue.With that said, Dialog indicated that it "expects to continue   shipping current and future generations of sub-PMICs for all   platforms to Apple." As you might recall, Dialog CEO Jalal   Bagherli said on the company's Aug. 2 earnings call that Dialog   has "two chips in the upcoming [iPhone] cycle, one is across all   three and one is across two models." (The chips in question   appear to be a main PMIC and a sub-PMIC.)Additionally, Dialog says that it has been "awarded a broad   range of new contracts" at Apple that "include the development   and supply of power management, audio subsystem, charging and   other mixed-signal integrated circuits for high-volume   applications."Per the company, that "[revenue] from new contracts is   expected to be realized starting in 2019 and accelerate in   2020."Dialog showed in a slide deck accompanying this announcement   that while roughly 75% of its revenue in 2018 came from Apple, it   expects that by 2022, sales to Apple will make up between 35% and   40% of its revenue.Given that Apple had successfully designed a main PMIC for the   iPhone XS Max, it wasn't a stretch to think that Apple could   apply future main PMIC chips more broadly across its iPhone   product portfolio over time. That's exactly what's set to happen,   and as an added bonus, Apple is also poised to bring its Apple   Watch and iPad main PMICs in-house, too.However, Apple and Dialog appear to have managed to work out a   deal so that this isn't a game-ending development for the   latter.Moreover, even though Apple is apparently moving its main PMIC   technology for all of its mobile products in-house, Dialog isn't   left completely out in the cold, as it'll keep generating revenue   from sales of sub-PMICs to Apple as well as from the "broad range   of new contracts" that it has inked with the   trillion-dollar    consumer electronics giant.  10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

 By Shreyashi   Sanyal Oct 12 (Reuters) - Wall Street rose on Friday after a bounce in technology and other high-growth stocks led a fight back from its worst two-day slide in eight months, while early gains from strong earnings of the biggest U.S. lenders faded. PNC Financial  led the losses among bank stocks with a 6.3 percent drop after the regional bank reported disappointing quarterly loan growth and said it expected only a small improvement in lending this quarter.  The only gainers among banks were Citigroup, which rose 0.6 percent and Wells Fargo  which eked out a 0.64 percent gain after upbeat results.  "Rising interest rates, higher yields and an accelerating economy sets the perfect environment for banks but the fact that they have underperformed the markets is a factor that has weighed," said Aaron Clark, portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management in Boston. Netflix, Amazon  and Apple  — some of the names that took a hit from an erratic selloff this week — rose between 1.9 percent and 5 percent. The S&P 500 technology index  rose 1.77 percent, providing the biggest boost to the S&P 500. "The past few days were a bit of a wake-up call, but it also created an opportunity for those who have been missing out to buy some of these high-growth technology names," said Jason Browne, chief investment strategist at FundX Investment Group in San Francisco.

Energy stocks  fell 0.80 percent as oil prices dropped after the International Energy Agency (IEA) deemed supply as adequate and the outlook for demand weakening.  Among the major gainers were the consumer discretionary  and communication services  sectors, which rose 1.20 percent and 1.15 percent, respectively. The two sectors, along with tech, house the high-growth FAANG group. Amazon, Apple, Netflix  and Alphabet  were trading higher between 1.4 percent and 5 percent. Facebook, however, gave up early gains to trade 0.4 percent lower. The company confirmed that a security breach announced late last month gave attackers access to about 30 million accounts, of which name and contact details were stolen of 29 million people.  Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.12-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 1.23-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded no new 52-week highs and 49 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded eight new highs and 197 new lows.

 By Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Amazon  could face a threat other than just EU antitrust scrutiny after a key EU lawmaker announced proposals aimed at curbing online marketplaces' use of merchants' data to boost sales of own brand products. Seeking to ensure a level playing field between tech giants such as Google, Amazon and Apple  and traditional businesses, the European Commission in April outlined draft rules to prevent unfair business practices. European Parliament lawmakers, whose approval is needed to ensure the proposal becomes legislation and under pressure to be seen as consumer-friendly ahead of elections in May, have since come up with about 680 amendments to beef up the draft. Key among these is the one proposed last week by Danish centre-left lawmaker Christel Schaldemose, the lead parliament negotiator, which takes aim at a case her compatriot, European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, is looking into. Schaldemose has proposed setting up Chinese walls between subsidiaries, according to a draft seen by Reuters. She aims to get her committee to vote on the amendments on Dec. 6. Vestager last month said she was gathering information on whether Amazon uses merchants' data in a way that hurts competition. Her power lies in her ability to impose fines while Schaldemose's proposal, if accepted, would be more far-reaching as it would apply to all companies regardless of their market power.  In her amendment, Schaldemose referred to investigations by antitrust regulators in the European Union and elsewhere into online intermediation services' dual role as a marketplace and as a rival on the same platform. "To ensure fairness, the provider of the online intermediation service should not be allowed to disclose the data generated by the transactions of a business user to third parties for commercial purposes, including within their own corporate structure, without the consent of the business user," the draft said. Lawmakers also want the rules to cover voice assistance services or virtual helpers such as Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri and Google Assistant because of their increasing popularity. After the committee vote, Schaldemose would then seek approval at the assembly a week later. EU lawmakers would then need to thrash out a common position with the Commission and EU countries before the proposals become law.

Tech bounce leads Wall St higher after two-day tumble
 By Shreyashi   Sanyal Oct 12 (Reuters) - Wall Street rose on Friday following its worst two-day slide in eight months as technology and other high-growth stocks led a fight back, while early gains from strong earnings of the biggest U.S. lenders, including JPMorgan, faded. Netflix, Amazon  and Apple  — some of the names that took a hit from an erratic selloff this week — rose between 1.7 percent and 4.05 percent, setting the Nasdaq for its best day since Aug. 2.

 Earnings season is here, and one of the early   trick-or-treaters will be    Netflix    (NASDAQ: NFLX) . The leading premium streaming service steps up   with its third-quarter financials next week, and there's a lot   riding on Tuesday afternoon's report.Stakes are high for one of the hottest   S&P 500    components over the past five years. The stock has shed a quarter   of its value since hitting all-time highs in June, a good chunk   of that coming this week given the swooning market. The stock has   pulled back enough where it could come through with a strong   bounce if next week's report impresses investors, but let's take   a look at some of the things that can go wrong for Netflix.  Cast members of "Elite," a Netflix Original Program. Image     source: Netflix.Netflix fell woefully short of its subscriber forecast   last time out    . Netflix closed out the second quarter with 5.15 million more   subscribers than it had when the period began, a number that most   streaming services would kill for but well below the 6.2 million   net additions it was targeting three months earlier.It goes without saying that falling short of public   projections is a bad look, but it would be particularly dubious   if Netflix misses the mark in back-to-back quarters. Netflix has   bounced back with blowout reports the two previous times that it   has failed to meet or exceed its forecast. Investors have been   able to forgive the misses as one-offs, but a repeat performance   would be as rare as it would be problematic in trusting Netflix's   future outlooks.Netflix dominates its niche, but reports are bubbling about   other tech giants making a bigger push for the streaming video   market.   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) is reportedly ready to launch an   IMDb-branded service    .   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) is   striking content deals    for its own inevitable platform.Tech giants have taken on Netflix before, but a distinctive   feature of these services is that the chatter centers around them   being made available to select users at no additional cost.   Amazon's IMDb platform would be available to existing Amazon   Prime customers and owners of Fire TV devices. CNBC is reporting   that Apple's original content may be included on its TV app   and available for free on iOS devices.Amazon already competes against Netflix by giving away Prime   Video to its more than 100 million Amazon Prime subscribers, and   Netflix hasn't broken a sweat as it pads its lead over the rest   of the industry. However, the growing availability of free   content could blur the value proposition of premium   platforms.Whatever Amazon and Apple have cooking obviously didn't factor   into Netflix's third-quarter financials, and there's no way   Netflix can bake that into its guidance for the current quarter.   However, CEO Reed Hastings has been frank in sizing up   competitive challenges in the past. This is a subject that could   come up in Tuesday's shareholder letter, and any sign of concern   will be amplified by the investing community.Netflix is working on what could be its third consecutive year   of accelerating revenue growth, but the trend is already starting   to go the other way. Revenue rose 40.4% in the first quarter and   40.3% in the second quarter, and while you have to go back to   2011 to find the last time that Netflix was sporting top-line   increases north of 40%, its outlook for the third quarter was far   more sobering.Netflix is eyeing 34% in revenue growth for the third quarter.   Analysts are holding out for a 29% increase in the fourth   quarter, so expectations are for Netflix's guidance to call for   continuing year-over-year revenue deceleration when it initiates   guidance for the period shortly after Tuesday's market close.The stock has taken a big hit over the past four months, and   expectations seem reasonable. Netflix is a prime candidate to   bounce back next week, but between its sloppy outlooks, looming   competitive pressures, and decelerating growth, there are several   things that can go wrong.  10 stocks we like better than Netflix       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.
